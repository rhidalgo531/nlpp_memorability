After all -- these guys can play... 	35300000	Slightly Memorable
Glass takes off at a trot. 	35200000	Slightly Memorable
WALTER I knew you'd love it. 16. 	35100000	Slightly Memorable
He isn't just scared anymore. 	35100000	Slightly Memorable
Cooper climbs down, pulls out his bag. ,	35000000	Slightly Memorable

Where I'm from. 	11200000	Slightly Memorable
BOSS You do understand this is a furniture company? 	11200000	Slightly Memorable
Glass is asleep. 	11100000	Slightly Memorable
KAY If he's your brother, why does he have a different name? ,	11100000	Slightly Memorable
Huh? 	11100000	Slightly Memorable
BRAND The mission commander wants to see you. 	11100000	Slightly Memorable
LIEUTENANT MITAKA Sir. 	11100000	Slightly Memorable
On the mat. 	11100000	Slightly Memorable
Teams and shit. 	11100000	Slightly Memorable
I guess we're done. 	11100000	Slightly Memorable
TRACY Look, I know things didn't go well today. ,	11100000	Slightly Memorable
The two look at each other. 	11100000	Slightly Memorable
CHRIS KYLE He left that part out. 	11100000	Slightly Memorable
MRS. ROSE Of course, come in. ,	11100000	Slightly Memorable
His face goes grave. 	11000000	Slightly Memorable
The crew break themselves away from the view and get to work. 	11000000	Slightly Memorable
KANE Hello, Butch! Did you like your old man's speech? ,	11000000	Slightly Memorable
ANNA Did they sign the contract? 	11000000	Slightly Memorable
TRACY (O.S.) What's that? 	11000000	Slightly Memorable
COCO So you want me to start a fight. 	11000000	Slightly Memorable
I'm not proud I wanted him to die, but it's the truth. ,	11000000	Slightly Memorable
BAM! He misses. 	11000000	Slightly Memorable
ABEL What is that? 	11000000	Slightly Memorable
TOM How long do you think it's been up there, Dad? ,	11000000	Slightly Memorable
The Empire. 	11000000	Slightly Memorable
SEBASTIAN I don't want to meet anyone. 	11000000	Slightly Memorable
A small one. 	11000000	Slightly Memorable
She gives him another look. 	11000000	Slightly Memorable
Look around. 	11000000	Slightly Memorable
CUT TO: LATER The three women sit. 	11000000	Slightly Memorable
Never mentioned none. 	11000000	Slightly Memorable
I don't know much about jazz. 	11000000	Slightly Memorable
We fear she may botch this completely... 	11000000	Slightly Memorable
Can you hear me...? 	11000000	Slightly Memorable
BRAND I've got you. 	11000000	Slightly Memorable
ANNA For what? 	11000000	Slightly Memorable
The door opens. 	11000000	Slightly Memorable
And you're so funny. 	11000000	Slightly Memorable
I am. 	11000000	Slightly Memorable
KANE Of course. 	11000000	Slightly Memorable
Cooper laughs, glimpsing the outline of a plan. ,	11000000	Slightly Memorable
An awkward silence. 	11000000	Slightly Memorable
A small gathering. 	11000000	Slightly Memorable
Scoop and shoot. 	11000000	Slightly Memorable
Du Pont is at the table. 	11000000	Slightly Memorable
Not even if this thing was gone for thirty years. 	10900000	Slightly Memorable
You belong with us. 	10900000	Slightly Memorable
ANNA This can't continue. 	10900000	Slightly Memorable
ANNA is already in the house talking with NANNY MARIA who's been baby-sitting. 	10900000	Slightly Memorable
They're all ears as they look across to... 	10900000	Slightly Memorable
We have to postpone the preview. 	10900000	Slightly Memorable
Du Pont smiles. 	10900000	Slightly Memorable
Our fund- raiser is four weeks away. 	10900000	Slightly Memorable
He stops his speech. 	10900000	Slightly Memorable
COOPER You really think there's a plan? 	10900000	Slightly Memorable
WALTER Well -- NO! Of course not. 	10900000	Slightly Memorable
Why didn't the "Enquirer" have that this morning? 	10900000	Slightly Memorable
ABEL How much? 	10900000	Slightly Memorable
Can you hear me...? 	10800000	Slightly Memorable
It's a shame we won't get to see it up close. 	10800000	Slightly Memorable
HER POV WALTER If you like this style, I'm working on a few new pieces. ,	10800000	Slightly Memorable
ABEL is exhausted. 	10800000	Slightly Memorable
I can admit that. 	10800000	Slightly Memorable
And a lot of oil. 	10800000	Slightly Memorable
Go to a Young Republican's meeting and bring up Welfare. 	10800000	Slightly Memorable
We've got two spreads of pictures. 	10800000	Slightly Memorable
Another day. 	10800000	Slightly Memorable
ABEL I agree. 	10800000	Slightly Memorable
Ankor Wat, the night the last King died. ,	10800000	Slightly Memorable
Chewie kind of likes you. 	10700000	Slightly Memorable
It doesn't do any of us any good to have this kind of attention brought to us. 	10700000	Slightly Memorable
Poe just glares. 	10700000	Slightly Memorable
LUISA Of course. 	10700000	Slightly Memorable
DU PONT America doesn't respect you. 	10700000	Slightly Memorable
She turns and looks at him. 	10700000	Slightly Memorable
FITZGERALD On foot? 	10700000	Slightly Memorable
No matter what you think of him, Abel doesn't work this way. ,	10700000	Slightly Memorable
This is insane. 	10700000	Slightly Memorable
DOYLE What problem? 	10700000	Slightly Memorable
Roosevelt and such. 	10700000	Slightly Memorable
She points to the old man lying in the bed. 	10700000	Slightly Memorable
I feel blessed. 	10700000	Slightly Memorable
ANNA Good for you. 	10700000	Slightly Memorable
Straightening the pillows. 	10600000	Slightly Memorable
And the first one left a bad taste. 	10600000	Slightly Memorable
The library that once helped set her on her path to acting. 	10600000	Slightly Memorable
He is nervous. 	10600000	Slightly Memorable
You're the one with the gift. (BEAT; HUSHED) Right now there's a shot... 	10600000	Slightly Memorable
ABEL I must? 	10600000	Slightly Memorable
She gestures him in. 	10600000	Slightly Memorable
Fingering her pencil... 	10600000	Slightly Memorable
Mia can't help but laugh. 	10600000	Slightly Memorable
Scans the motherboard. 	10600000	Slightly Memorable
Are you hungry? 	10600000	Slightly Memorable
Let's get to work. 	10500000	Slightly Memorable
He's showing Alex how to change the oil filter. 	10500000	Slightly Memorable
Stumbles out the door. 	10500000	Slightly Memorable
I can admit that. 	10500000	Slightly Memorable
ABEL I will. 	10500000	Slightly Memorable
This is unexpected. 	10500000	Slightly Memorable
This sits unanswered. 19 A.D.A. 	10500000	Slightly Memorable
Finn awkwardly smiles. 	10500000	Slightly Memorable
COLTON No way. 	10500000	Slightly Memorable
JANE But you never see Walter? 	10500000	Slightly Memorable
Leia, I saw our son. ,	10500000	Slightly Memorable
It was some kid. 	10500000	Slightly Memorable
CHRIS I just know. 	10400000	Slightly Memorable
Information begins appearing on the terminal's screen. 	10400000	Slightly Memorable
ANNA I mean it. 	10400000	Slightly Memorable
This is an honorable institution. 	10400000	Slightly Memorable
He chugs his glass. 	10400000	Slightly Memorable
ABEL To grow. 	10400000	Slightly Memorable
Twenty-one. 	10400000	Slightly Memorable
A deadly silence. 	10400000	Slightly Memorable
Mia is left standing on her own. 	10400000	Slightly Memorable
How much? 91. 	10400000	Slightly Memorable
Du Pont enters. 	10400000	Slightly Memorable
Baby, when you look at me like that, I could fall hard. ,	10400000	Slightly Memorable
What a nightmare... 	10400000	Slightly Memorable
WALTER Sure! Why not? 	10400000	Slightly Memorable
Leland doesn't look up at him. 	10400000	Slightly Memorable
A little girl. 	10400000	Slightly Memorable
TOM What about the tire? 	10300000	Slightly Memorable
Even when you're here you're not here. 	10300000	Slightly Memorable
They stare at each other, then the truck. ,	10300000	Slightly Memorable
Waits. 	10300000	Slightly Memorable
CHRIS (snaps-to; to Colton) Get off the floor. 	10300000	Slightly Memorable
DAUBER Country is countrywide, sir. ,	10300000	Slightly Memorable
She opens the door... 	10300000	Slightly Memorable
Sebastian steps in. 	10300000	Slightly Memorable
Lawrence needs him. 	10300000	Slightly Memorable
Leland is surprised. 	10300000	Slightly Memorable
Jean du Pont. 	10300000	Slightly Memorable
I want to meet him. 	10300000	Slightly Memorable
Mia is left standing on her own. 	10300000	Slightly Memorable
He SINGS. He has a beautiful voice. 	10300000	Slightly Memorable
The door blows off. 	10300000	Slightly Memorable
Just try to imagine that. 	10300000	Slightly Memorable
REGGIE This shit. 	10300000	Slightly Memorable
A bit weathered. 	10300000	Slightly Memorable
How can you? 	10300000	Slightly Memorable
CARTER There is no news big enough. 	10300000	Slightly Memorable
LELAND Why not? 	10300000	Slightly Memorable
The Singer walks off. 	10200000	Slightly Memorable
Sebastian steps in. 	10200000	Slightly Memorable
Stabbed. 	10200000	Slightly Memorable
ROTH Look at that. 	10200000	Slightly Memorable
Shocked. 	10200000	Slightly Memorable
SARAH What the fuck is wrong with you! What'd you expect? 	10200000	Slightly Memorable
I thought-- TAYA He didn't get in. 	10200000	Slightly Memorable
Spit it out. 	10200000	Slightly Memorable
She's pleased. 	10200000	Slightly Memorable
We feel shame. 	10200000	Slightly Memorable
Finally he stops. 	10200000	Slightly Memorable
LELAND He married for love - (a little laugh) That's why he did everything. 	10200000	Slightly Memorable
He's an Avenger. 	10200000	Slightly Memorable
Virgil quickly snatches them back... 	10200000	Slightly Memorable
I have to be a little drunk for that because I'm a coward. 	10200000	Slightly Memorable
DU PONT Just some of the older ones. 	10200000	Slightly Memorable
She's a dignitary. 	10200000	Slightly Memorable
Sees the Valet. 	10200000	Slightly Memorable
ABEL Do we even need to be doing this? 	10200000	Slightly Memorable
VAN ROARS up the turning lane. 	10200000	Slightly Memorable
You in one piece? 	10200000	Slightly Memorable
He stops, looks. ,	10200000	Slightly Memorable
They walk away. 	10200000	Slightly Memorable
ABEL A lot. 	10200000	Slightly Memorable
Because if it had we'd all be dead by now. 	10200000	Slightly Memorable
MARGARET I don't want you sleeping in this room any longer. 	10100000	Slightly Memorable
CHRIS Is that high? 	10100000	Slightly Memorable
ANNA Because they are. 	10100000	Slightly Memorable
CHRIS Yes I do. 	10100000	Slightly Memorable
WALTER Teach me. (BEAT) Show me your tricks. 	10100000	Slightly Memorable
He stops when he sees Thatcher. 	10100000	Slightly Memorable
COOPER Can you ask it to stop? 	10100000	Slightly Memorable
Not alone. 	10100000	Slightly Memorable
Sebastian steps in. 	10100000	Slightly Memorable
A cab has pulled up. 	10100000	Slightly Memorable
The Singer walks off. 	10100000	Slightly Memorable
That's why I asked. 	10100000	Slightly Memorable
An awkward pause. 	10100000	Slightly Memorable
ABEL A toast. 	10100000	Slightly Memorable
Mia can't help but laugh. 	10100000	Slightly Memorable
CHRIS Is it Mustafa? 	10100000	Slightly Memorable
The RUMBLE grows. 	10000000	Slightly Memorable
COOPER I've got you. 	10000000	Slightly Memorable
SUSAN On the chiffonier. 	10000000	Slightly Memorable
She's not surprised. 	10000000	Slightly Memorable
You'd never have made Chief if I nicknamed you "The Myth". 	10000000	Slightly Memorable
Riggan gives Jake a look. 	10000000	Slightly Memorable
One eyebrow raised. 	10000000	Slightly Memorable
She's drawing. 	10000000	Slightly Memorable
MIA People will want to go to it! People love what other people are passionate about. 	10000000	Slightly Memorable
Sweating. 	9990000	Slightly Memorable
How are things? 	9990000	Slightly Memorable
Again and again. 	9980000	Slightly Memorable
MURPH But what if there is, dad? ,	9980000	Slightly Memorable
ANNA What is this? 	9980000	Slightly Memorable
WOLTZ I'm going to show you something beautiful. 	9950000	Slightly Memorable
CHRIS That's me. 	9940000	Slightly Memorable

I'll see you. 	9930000	Slightly Memorable
CHRIS I can hunt. 	9930000	Slightly Memorable
Shangri-la? 	9920000	Slightly Memorable
The two look at each other. 	9920000	Slightly Memorable
They're running wild. 	9920000	Slightly Memorable
I know it. 	9910000	Slightly Memorable
But they just need to show that they are defending themselves, and this will stop. ,	9910000	Slightly Memorable
But they just need to show that they are defending themselves, and this will stop. ,	9910000	Slightly Memorable
BACK TO SCENE 27. 	9900000	Slightly Memorable
ANNA What does that mean you will take care of it. 	9890000	Slightly Memorable
It is Susie. 	9890000	Slightly Memorable
One, two, three seconds later. ,	9890000	Slightly Memorable
Answers -- SEBASTIAN What...? 	9880000	Slightly Memorable
Leland comes in. 	9860000	Slightly Memorable
I saw him. 	9850000	Slightly Memorable
MARGARET What? (CONFUSED; BEAT) Oh -- you mean Lily! No, she doesn't really live with us. ,	9830000	Slightly Memorable
He looks over in the other mirror and there is THUG #2 walking up. 	9830000	Slightly Memorable
And -- Walter is taken aback. 	9810000	Slightly Memorable
For the bear. 	9800000	Slightly Memorable
KURT Your son tell you that? 	9800000	Slightly Memorable
Bernstein joins him. 	9800000	Slightly Memorable
They're just... blank. 	9790000	Slightly Memorable
Shoots a Trooper. 	9790000	Slightly Memorable
Can you confirm? 	9780000	Slightly Memorable
They're both naked. 	9780000	Slightly Memorable
I'm The Legend. (laughs at self; into phone) Hey babe-- TAYA (OS) You were right, doctor says it's a boy. ,	9770000	Slightly Memorable
What's wrong? 	9760000	Slightly Memorable
All good. 	9760000	Slightly Memorable
GORDON Yo Kurt. 	9750000	Slightly Memorable
Just a moment. 	9750000	Slightly Memorable

Right, Moe? ,	9730000	Slightly Memorable
LELAND It's been a tough day. 	9720000	Slightly Memorable
For the bear. 	9710000	Slightly Memorable
A beat. 	9710000	Slightly Memorable
BERNSTEIN Right away. 	9710000	Slightly Memorable
Is this going to make you safe? 	9700000	Slightly Memorable
ANDREW WALSH He wants to talk to them. 	9700000	Slightly Memorable
A beat. 	9690000	Slightly Memorable
Just a moment. 	9690000	Slightly Memorable
A beat. 	9690000	Slightly Memorable
A beat. 	9680000	Slightly Memorable
JEAN Which ribbons? 	9680000	Slightly Memorable
A beat. 	9660000	Slightly Memorable
JAKE He's not that bad. 	9660000	Slightly Memorable
BRIDGER But, Captain. ,	9650000	Slightly Memorable
A beat. 	9650000	Slightly Memorable
Her face. 	9650000	Slightly Memorable
Look... can we just do a crying child? 	9650000	Slightly Memorable
A beat. 	9650000	Slightly Memorable
Green-light. 	9640000	Slightly Memorable
He's made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them. 	9640000	Slightly Memorable
KANE No. But you're close. 	9640000	Slightly Memorable
A beat. 	9640000	Slightly Memorable
LESLEY And stayed??? 	9630000	Slightly Memorable
A beat. 	9630000	Slightly Memorable
And that's all Pig can stand... he TACKLES FITZGERALD... they roll to the ground. 	9620000	Slightly Memorable
A beat. 	9620000	Slightly Memorable
A beat. 	9610000	Slightly Memorable
He looks at his crew who laugh at him. 	9610000	Slightly Memorable
BERNSTEIN So then, tonight, we go over everything thoroughly, eh? ,	9600000	Slightly Memorable
GLASS Middle of workin' on it. 	9590000	Slightly Memorable
He looks up: the tree is venting steam. 	9590000	Slightly Memorable
Would you be willing to take a look. 	9590000	Slightly Memorable
What to do?? 	9580000	Slightly Memorable
There is a silence. 	9580000	Slightly Memorable
Now just get out there and do what you were born to do. 	9570000	Slightly Memorable
Woeful Keane kids. 	9560000	Slightly Memorable
Why should it matter now? 	9560000	Slightly Memorable
How was the flight? 	9550000	Slightly Memorable
It's different. 	9550000	Slightly Memorable
A beat. 	9550000	Slightly Memorable
MIA Why what? 	9530000	Slightly Memorable
SEBASTIAN That's it? 	9530000	Slightly Memorable
That means you all are stealing from each other. 	9530000	Slightly Memorable
Most of it, anyway. ,	9520000	Slightly Memorable
A tiny reading -- non-lethal. 	9520000	Slightly Memorable
Only you're going to need more than one lesson. 	9510000	Slightly Memorable
You're the public face of Foxcatcher. 	9500000	Slightly Memorable
CATHERINE It was just sitting right here. 	9500000	Slightly Memorable
Takes a moment. 	9500000	Slightly Memorable
There is a pause. 	9480000	Slightly Memorable
SUSAN (glares at him balefully) What do you mean? 	9480000	Slightly Memorable
CUT TO: 30. 	9480000	Slightly Memorable
MIKE Nobody's drunk. 	9470000	Slightly Memorable
But he can't leave his boys behind. 	9450000	Slightly Memorable
Takes a moment. 	9450000	Slightly Memorable
Takes a moment. 	9440000	Slightly Memorable
THE CAPTAIN Rosebud? 	9440000	Slightly Memorable
Mia looks up. 	9430000	Slightly Memorable
Takes it in. 	9430000	Slightly Memorable
Her mask is also broken. 	9430000	Slightly Memorable
The couple smile. 	9430000	Slightly Memorable
FN-2187 This is a rescue, I'm helping you escape. ,	9420000	Slightly Memorable

Kylo Ren watches him go. 	9410000	Slightly Memorable
Murphy hustles out. 	9400000	Slightly Memorable
COOPER We'll be back. 	9400000	Slightly Memorable
She turns off the vent. 	9390000	Slightly Memorable
A moment passes. 	9390000	Slightly Memorable
She turns off the vent. 	9380000	Slightly Memorable
MARGARET No, please! Walter, it's -- personal. 49. ,	9370000	Slightly Memorable
DON CORLEONE Then the picture will wait for him. 	9360000	Slightly Memorable
SEBASTIAN (not listening to her) What am I supposed to do? 	9360000	Slightly Memorable
At least until we know what we're dealing with. 	9350000	Slightly Memorable
All the time. 	9350000	Slightly Memorable
It totally misses THUG #2. 	9350000	Slightly Memorable
But please know that I have always chosen the path that was the most right. 	9350000	Slightly Memorable
Walter calms himself, contrite. ,	9350000	Slightly Memorable
He grabs a mike. 	9340000	Slightly Memorable
SAM I don't know. 	9340000	Slightly Memorable
It has to be good. 	9340000	Slightly Memorable
LIONEL I don't know... 	9330000	Slightly Memorable
They get led in. 	9330000	Slightly Memorable
LIONEL I don't know. 	9330000	Slightly Memorable
Cooper looks down -- a great fissure has opened in the ice beneath them. 	9330000	Slightly Memorable
They know each other. 	9310000	Slightly Memorable
So they beat her like an animal. 	9290000	Slightly Memorable
MIA'S DAD Never. 	9290000	Slightly Memorable
Night should be falling soon. 	9290000	Slightly Memorable
A moment passes. 	9290000	Slightly Memorable
They won't be able to fight it for long. 	9280000	Slightly Memorable
I wish I were a little boy and going to make a trip like that for the first time. 	9280000	Slightly Memorable
Swallows the pill. 	9280000	Slightly Memorable
ABEL is keeping up with him and in fact may be gaining on him. 	9270000	Slightly Memorable
All of you. 	9260000	Slightly Memorable

How far back are they going? 	9230000	Slightly Memorable
LUISA I don't know? 	9230000	Slightly Memorable
She's an hour-and-a-half walk from her place. 	9230000	Slightly Memorable
KANE Don't you realize that everybody here is going to know about this? 	9220000	Slightly Memorable
DU PONT ... 	9220000	Slightly Memorable
The other GUARD opens up the back of the truck. 	9210000	Slightly Memorable
Mark doesn't acknowledge him. 	9200000	Slightly Memorable
A clock ticks. 	9200000	Slightly Memorable

Good luck. 	8170000	Slightly Memorable
Sebastian is silent. 	8170000	Slightly Memorable
But there are great numbers of candidates. 	8170000	Slightly Memorable
A LOW RUMBLING SOUND. Cooper looks out over the river. 	8170000	Slightly Memorable

LELAND (good naturedly) You're in a conspiracy against me, you two. ,	8120000	Slightly Memorable
The voices fade. 	8100000	Slightly Memorable
A line she can't cross. 	8100000	Slightly Memorable
Most of it is crap. 	8100000	Slightly Memorable
Rocky Mountain Fur Company wants him too. 	8080000	Slightly Memorable

Twenty years. 	8040000	Slightly Memorable

HAGEN It's from Johnny. 	7980000	Slightly Memorable
He's given up fighting this fight. 	7980000	Slightly Memorable
Look from where I'm sitting this place is a goldmine. 	7980000	Slightly Memorable

JANE Take the bed. 	7980000	Slightly Memorable

COCO Don't talk like that. 48. 	7920000	Slightly Memorable
We see it behind his head. 	7910000	Slightly Memorable
Whether that gets us to Union or not... 	7910000	Slightly Memorable
As a company. 	7910000	Slightly Memorable
One eyebrow raised. 	7900000	Slightly Memorable
Besides, they tell me there isn't a decent restaurant on the whole island. ,	7890000	Slightly Memorable

He wants you to come down in person anyway. 	7780000	Slightly Memorable
He POUNDS it, crazed. ,	7780000	Slightly Memorable
FITZGERALD Not that you'd hit me if you tried. 	7760000	Slightly Memorable

On the floor. 	7690000	Slightly Memorable

You tell him from me...he should be. 	7660000	Slightly Memorable
But the ball never returns. 	7660000	Slightly Memorable
Punishment for losing. 	7650000	Slightly Memorable

He reaches the gallery -- then stops, dumbfounded. ,	7640000	Slightly Memorable
MAN (V.O.) We don't belong in this shithole. 	7640000	Slightly Memorable

The car pulls up to them and stops. 	7610000	Slightly Memorable

KYLO REN Put him on board. 	7590000	Slightly Memorable

To anyone I love? 	7480000	Not Memorable
Tunnel's old -- the ice has reformed at the bottom. 	7480000	Not Memorable
With the briefcase? 	7470000	Not Memorable
If only he had his Anstadt. 	7460000	Not Memorable
MIKE Can we-- Are we doing something here? 	7460000	Not Memorable
REY What was that? 	7460000	Not Memorable
KANE Please, Mr. Bernstein. ,	7460000	Not Memorable
He walks back up to her in an aggressive way. 	7460000	Not Memorable
REY What about him? 	7460000	Not Memorable
I just never should have sent him away. 	7450000	Not Memorable
Cooper looks over the relay log. 	7440000	Not Memorable
MARGARET What do you want, Walter? ,	7430000	Not Memorable
Tom gets up to leave. 	7430000	Not Memorable
SUSAN I always like to see the funny side of things. 	7430000	Not Memorable
MICHAEL For killing a man. 	7420000	Not Memorable
Agony. 	7410000	Not Memorable
CHRIS No-- (keys mike) It came from behind us. 	7410000	Not Memorable
Caught in his glow. 	7390000	Not Memorable
Then -- FLASH! FLASH! FLASH! Walter turns. 	7390000	Not Memorable
KURT The hell does Sam think she is? 	7390000	Not Memorable
SUSAN In the water. 	7380000	Not Memorable
WALTER I call as my witness... 	7380000	Not Memorable
But nothing has prepared him for this: He is completely alone. 	7380000	Not Memorable
MIA I think today's San Diego. 	7370000	Not Memorable
The pull to the light. 	7360000	Not Memorable
Matter-of-fact -- SEBASTIAN The house across from the library. 	7340000	Not Memorable
Trying to process his disgust. 	7330000	Not Memorable
The energy swells and the four characters dance their way together down the street. 	7330000	Not Memorable
Even Cooper stops, awed by the beauty of the display. ,	7330000	Not Memorable
We see a vulnerability we haven't seen before - something lost or disoriented. 	7330000	Not Memorable
Rey as a child. 	7330000	Not Memorable
And frankly, I don't have to convince you. 83. ,	7320000	Not Memorable
Then, a terrible, shameful idea forms: SNOBBY ARTIST #1 I'll bet I could bang one out in ten minutes. ,	7320000	Not Memorable
CHRIS Where is everybody? 	7310000	Not Memorable
ANDREW WALSH That's true, until its not. ,	7310000	Not Memorable
There are good nights. 	7300000	Not Memorable
ABEL You need to get home and start going through our set of books. 	7300000	Not Memorable
Her face distorts in pain again. 	7300000	Not Memorable
Kane stares at him. 	7300000	Not Memorable
BILL O'LEARY It's not always as simple as it appears. 	7300000	Not Memorable
This poor kid has been working his ass off. 	7290000	Not Memorable
RIGGAN "I'm the wrong person to ask. 	7280000	Not Memorable
RIGGAN "I'm the wrong person to ask. 	7280000	Not Memorable
Because you are. 	7280000	Not Memorable
KANE Keep it locked. 	7270000	Not Memorable
Kane doesn't answer. 	7260000	Not Memorable
COOPER What'd you paint? 	7260000	Not Memorable
She doesn't say the words with any anger. 	7250000	Not Memorable
I'm really scared. 	7250000	Not Memorable
MARGARET How can you keep something so big a secret??? 	7240000	Not Memorable
KANE Are you hurt? 	7240000	Not Memorable
KANE Where is he? 	7220000	Not Memorable
Dave looks around the open hood. 72. 	7220000	Not Memorable
Leia hears this. 	7210000	Not Memorable
ABEL First, please know that we respect the work you are doing to try to help our business and the city. ,	7210000	Not Memorable
KANE I'm not sorry. 	7210000	Not Memorable
On Bridge. 	7200000	Not Memorable
Suddenly, the drone SOARS back over them. ,	7200000	Not Memorable
The alarm will be in on Monday. 	7200000	Not Memorable
They reach the front of Lionel's house. 	7190000	Not Memorable
He wanted me with Fletcher's daughter. 	7190000	Not Memorable
Dust blooms from it. 	7190000	Not Memorable
Dollar signs in his eyes. 	7180000	Not Memorable
HENRY Guess you would've been better off on your own. 	7170000	Not Memorable
It is important to remember always that only at the very end of the story is Thompson himself a personality. 	7170000	Not Memorable
Glass starts crawling toward it. 	7170000	Not Memorable
AGAIN. He grabs his knife... is ready to finish Bridger off... ...but Fitzgerald is smart enough to know that out here, two are safer than one... even when one is just a kid. ,He starts walking away. ,	7170000	Not Memorable
Anna! They wait. 	7160000	Not Memorable
POE Well, because of you now we have a chance. ,	7160000	Not Memorable
We don't want much smoke when we cook that grizzly. 	7160000	Not Memorable
He puts it away and then looks up at the bridge that is hovering above him. 	7160000	Not Memorable
SAM We? I didn't see you running for shit Reggie. 	7150000	Not Memorable
ROTH Not enough, unfortunately. ,	7150000	Not Memorable
He hugs her and she heads for the capsule. 	7150000	Not Memorable
Over a year? 	7140000	Not Memorable
ABEL I said...213,000. ,	7140000	Not Memorable
PETER FORENTE Is everyone okay? 	7140000	Not Memorable
Cooper, stunned, looks at Brand. ,	7130000	Not Memorable
He's "won". 	7130000	Not Memorable
Brand stares at it, startled. ,	7130000	Not Memorable
I want you to meet someone. 	7130000	Not Memorable
BRAND Where did they go? 	7130000	Not Memorable
Several hundred years too late. 	7130000	Not Memorable
BRAND It's a paradox. 	7130000	Not Memorable
No sign of Margaret. 	7120000	Not Memorable
CHRIS (keys mike) Dauber? 	7120000	Not Memorable
I can't do them anymore, but you can, if you choose to. ,	7120000	Not Memorable
Scattered applause, though no one has any idea what he's talking about. ,	7110000	Not Memorable
GORDON Please put that away. 	7110000	Not Memorable
MARGARET I just gave in. 	7100000	Not Memorable
If it's on Jakku, we'll soon have it. ,	7100000	Not Memorable
He shuts down the monitor. 	7090000	Not Memorable
Don't worry. 	7090000	Not Memorable
Exhausted. 	7090000	Not Memorable
He stops and thinks about how to continue. 	7090000	Not Memorable
He is getting an idea... 	7090000	Not Memorable
But the robots survived. 	7090000	Not Memorable
Look at this. 	7080000	Not Memorable
Let's go. 	7070000	Not Memorable
Exhausted. 	7070000	Not Memorable
TAYA Well, this is the first time we left the house. ,	7070000	Not Memorable
The audience laughs harder. 	7060000	Not Memorable
As JULIAN is hiding, trying to figure out what to do next, LOUIS SERVIDIO goes running by him. ,	7060000	Not Memorable
She sings about them and for them. 	7060000	Not Memorable
Mia removes her shoes, feels the soft carpet under her feet. ,Turns on the projector. ,	7050000	Not Memorable
He looks unsure. 	7050000	Not Memorable
He looks at the piles of work, and can't face it. ,	7040000	Not Memorable
Like, I don't... ,	7030000	Not Memorable
ROTH Wherever we want. 	7030000	Not Memorable
Then -- KEITH I get it. 	7030000	Not Memorable
Exhausted. 	7020000	Not Memorable
You lost? 	7020000	Not Memorable
JAKE What's that? 	7000000	Not Memorable
WALTER You sound crazy! For God's sake. 	7000000	Not Memorable
FAST FOOD KID # 4. 	6990000	Not Memorable
Has found where it's coming from... 	6990000	Not Memorable
Kane at the window. 	6990000	Not Memorable
He continues to stare. 	6990000	Not Memorable
Is he really going to have to tell this guy the lay of the land? 	6990000	Not Memorable
I said, "You motherfucker. ,	6940000	Not Memorable
Gimme a hug. 	6940000	Not Memorable
COOPER Am I really going to hurt anybody by going to look for her? 	6940000	Not Memorable
WOMAN Cappuccino, please. ,	6940000	Not Memorable
His transponder is still working. 	6930000	Not Memorable
JULIAN I think so. 	6920000	Not Memorable
COOPER You never had any? 	6920000	Not Memorable
Go. Now. 	6910000	Not Memorable
The track stops. 	6910000	Not Memorable
JULIAN I didn't. 	6910000	Not Memorable
This is the prize. 	6910000	Not Memorable
Suddenly, he trips over something, dropping the equipment. ,	6910000	Not Memorable
The dog lays by the door. 	6900000	Not Memorable
Licks the metal plate. 	6900000	Not Memorable
But I think Roth might be right. 	6890000	Not Memorable
You decide you want to talk, you know where to find me. ,	6880000	Not Memorable
TAYA I can't hear you-- CHRIS I'm ready to come home. 	6880000	Not Memorable
The Priest considers this. 	6880000	Not Memorable
ROTH About five minutes. 	6880000	Not Memorable
He grimaces, embarrassed. ,	6870000	Not Memorable
SOFIA What do you do in the bathroom? 	6870000	Not Memorable
On the two of them - studying, contemplating... ,	6870000	Not Memorable
Big one. 	6860000	Not Memorable
Yes or no? 	6860000	Not Memorable
MARK (STILL WATCHING) The fuck you talking about? 	6860000	Not Memorable
Holds out his hand. 	6860000	Not Memorable
FINN I disagree. 	6850000	Not Memorable
The RADIO STATIC-- BIGGLES --I can't hear you. 	6850000	Not Memorable
BRAND You're on this mission because you're another pair of hands. 	6850000	Not Memorable
Slides in a suitcase. 	6840000	Not Memorable
POE No, no, no. ,	6840000	Not Memorable
Then the second set of doors open. 	6840000	Not Memorable
Kane, in her name. ,	6830000	Not Memorable
Over and over. 	6830000	Not Memorable
THOMPSON Oh! I thought maybe we could have a drink together? 	6830000	Not Memorable
Mia thinks about this one for a moment. 	6820000	Not Memorable
Sees the Valet. 	6810000	Not Memorable
This is one thing you're not going to have your own way about. 	6810000	Not Memorable
KANE (quietly) Is it good? 	6800000	Not Memorable
His curiosity doesn't make anyone else feel any better. 	6800000	Not Memorable
BANDUCCI I like my club the way it is. 	6800000	Not Memorable
Doyle looks behind them. 	6790000	Not Memorable
Susan reaches out her hand. 	6790000	Not Memorable
This is very serious. 	6780000	Not Memorable
ABEL First off I don't walk around like I am saving anything. 	6780000	Not Memorable
WOMAN Cappuccino, please. ,	6780000	Not Memorable
Without looking up, she clings to him for a moment, and trembles. ,	6770000	Not Memorable
How could you? 	6770000	Not Memorable
They have another one waiting for me in orbit. 	6760000	Not Memorable
And WE RETURN TO... 	6750000	Not Memorable
Tell him. 	6750000	Not Memorable
He continues to slam on the brakes and comes to a complete stop. 	6740000	Not Memorable
JOHNNY He owns the studio. 	6740000	Not Memorable
He's restless. 	6740000	Not Memorable
DOCTOR HOFFSTADER I imagine you're still decompressing. 	6730000	Not Memorable
The Stranger walks faster. 	6730000	Not Memorable
Your job is to protect those Marines at all costs. 	6730000	Not Memorable
BRAND What do you mean, you're going to let go? ,	6720000	Not Memorable
An empire upon an empire. 	6720000	Not Memorable
CHRIS How about this: one shot, one answer. ,	6720000	Not Memorable
I'm driving down to the city with Kay tomorrow morning. 	6720000	Not Memorable
CHRIS We don't have to do this... 	6720000	Not Memorable
Makes a few notes in his file. 	6720000	Not Memorable
LIONEL I think it's gaining sentience. 	6710000	Not Memorable
Poe hits a control. 	6710000	Not Memorable
I can see you. 	6710000	Not Memorable
Finally, rallying them: LEIA Han's right. ,	6710000	Not Memorable
Lionel gets up and walks towards the door. 	6700000	Not Memorable
You lost. 	6700000	Not Memorable
DU PONT Read the speech. 	6690000	Not Memorable
THE PRESIDENT I understand that you have political ambitions. 	6690000	Not Memorable
He's restless. 	6690000	Not Memorable
ABEL That's possible. 	6690000	Not Memorable
This is our stop. 	6680000	Not Memorable
For old times' sake? 	6670000	Not Memorable
His eyes linger a little too long and a little too low... 	6670000	Not Memorable
He is a small man, very dark, with curly black hair. ,	6660000	Not Memorable
GORDON Are we sure about this? 	6650000	Not Memorable
Maybe it's an invitation. 	6650000	Not Memorable
CITY EDITOR Oh, yes, it's already made up. ,	6640000	Not Memorable
She looks him directly in the eye. 	6630000	Not Memorable
JAKE How's it going, buddy. ,	6620000	Not Memorable
ANDREW looks him right in the eye. 	6620000	Not Memorable
The hall is coming apart in dusty chunks of plaster. 	6620000	Not Memorable
Something sparks in Lionel. 	6620000	Not Memorable
ABEL What's that? 	6610000	Not Memorable
What you've decided I ought to have - what you'd want if you were me. 	6610000	Not Memorable
Where's Calo? 	6610000	Not Memorable
ABEL What's that? 	6610000	Not Memorable
He's restless. 	6610000	Not Memorable
COOPER Case, wait-- Case PUNCHES again. ,	6600000	Not Memorable
Suddenly, GAS sprays back up at him. ,	6600000	Not Memorable
There are other subjects in the world. 	6600000	Not Memorable
HENRY We wait. 	6590000	Not Memorable
SEBASTIAN When I unpack them in my club. 	6580000	Not Memorable
We all will be if he keeps screamin' like that. 	6580000	Not Memorable
She tries to suppress them. 	6570000	Not Memorable
They've finished eating. 	6560000	Not Memorable
KANE Get me a typewriter. 	6550000	Not Memorable
SEBASTIAN Ok. Then I have someone I'd like you to meet. 	6550000	Not Memorable
V.I.P. 	6550000	Not Memorable
They look at each other, fixedly, but she doesn't give way. ,	6540000	Not Memorable
Do you...indulge? 	6540000	Not Memorable
V.I.P. 	6540000	Not Memorable
I think he's drinking real gin. 	6530000	Not Memorable
I just wanted to make sure you had all the information I do. 	6520000	Not Memorable
FITZGERALD I had enough of this cold as hell shit. 	6520000	Not Memorable
Cracks like a whip. 	6520000	Not Memorable
But who's counting. 	6510000	Not Memorable
I'm gonna have to start from scratch, with less than twenty-four hours... ,	6510000	Not Memorable
It's not my fault I got Shanghai'ed. 	6510000	Not Memorable
Tap my arm or bang something metal if you have a problem. 	6510000	Not Memorable
Hope you're safe up there. 54. 	6500000	Not Memorable
And the parents and the teachers. 	6500000	Not Memorable
ABEL Is it clean? 	6480000	Not Memorable
ABEL is standing off alone. 	6480000	Not Memorable
She loves them. 	6480000	Not Memorable
LELAND I'm glad to see you. 	6480000	Not Memorable
Han looks to BB-8. 	6470000	Not Memorable
The same one we saw in her car... 	6470000	Not Memorable
It's going to be incredible... (beat; then, softer --) Well he has to get the money together first, and... ,	6470000	Not Memorable
With that, the Boss walks off. ,	6460000	Not Memorable
I know every time you... every time you look at me, you're reminded of him. ,	6460000	Not Memorable
Han takes this in. 	6450000	Not Memorable
WALSH (V.O.) What? 	6450000	Not Memorable
Look at me... 	6440000	Not Memorable
The same one we saw in her car... 	6440000	Not Memorable
On the floor. (UNSURE) Really? 	6430000	Not Memorable
HAN Any of it. 	6420000	Not Memorable
Then he looks back down to his reflection in the water... battered and scarred. 	6420000	Not Memorable
Garcia runs into the other room. 	6420000	Not Memorable
And -- his eyes pop, astonished. ,	6420000	Not Memorable
If we can find it on our scanners, the First Order's not far behind. ,	6410000	Not Memorable
Nobody is there to share the moment. 	6410000	Not Memorable
Lionel shakes it off. 	6400000	Not Memorable
I didn't even know the guy. 	6400000	Not Memorable
Dial it up, or down. ,	6400000	Not Memorable
ANNA is besides herself. 	6400000	Not Memorable
She cooks for one. 	6390000	Not Memorable
GEORGE Don't you dare. 	6390000	Not Memorable
You're the creator. 	6390000	Not Memorable
We'll use the patch kit. 	6390000	Not Memorable
Probably gives you cancer, but you find your car more quickly. ,	6370000	Not Memorable
She says this as though just realizing it. 	6370000	Not Memorable
And leaves. 	6360000	Not Memorable
The crew looks out through the hull. 	6360000	Not Memorable
The engine heats up white-hot. 	6350000	Not Memorable
The cop gets in his car and prepares to drive away. 	6350000	Not Memorable
You have a chance to do what no wrestler's done since 1904. 	6350000	Not Memorable
I'll get the money. 	6350000	Not Memorable
And I'll tell you why. 	6350000	Not Memorable
I called her myself the day after he died. 	6340000	Not Memorable
RUSTY How's Tess? 	6340000	Not Memorable
And it's too damn cold to go without one. 35. 	6340000	Not Memorable
BIGGLES They serve more customers than McDonalds. 	6340000	Not Memorable
I wrestle at 180... 	6330000	Not Memorable
And what's this year's theme? 	6330000	Not Memorable
Probably gives you cancer, but you find your car more quickly. ,	6320000	Not Memorable
The music has stopped. 	6320000	Not Memorable
You'll like this. 	6320000	Not Memorable
He looks idiotic. 	6320000	Not Memorable
SEBASTIAN There's a nice way to say that. 	6310000	Not Memorable
Moves a couple of boxes from the hall. 	6310000	Not Memorable
SEBASTIAN Yeah I don't think so either. 	6310000	Not Memorable
BRAND I'd trust him a lot more than I'd trust you. 	6300000	Not Memorable
LESLEY Is he breathing? 	6300000	Not Memorable
On edge... 	6300000	Not Memorable
No one is there. 	6290000	Not Memorable
You shouldn't have any knowledge about it anyway. 	6280000	Not Memorable
Reaches for the curtains. 	6280000	Not Memorable
Read that on the internet. 	6270000	Not Memorable
Weaved bitch? (MORE) 26. 	6240000	Not Memorable
Walter gives her a funny look. 	6240000	Not Memorable
HAN The face of my son. 	6240000	Not Memorable
MICHAEL You like spaghetti? 	6240000	Not Memorable
SEBASTIAN There's a nice way to say that. 	6230000	Not Memorable
We hear BOOS from a crowd. 	6230000	Not Memorable
Doyle is freaking out. 	6230000	Not Memorable
If you want to come here, you ask me. ,	6230000	Not Memorable
ONE OF THE GIRLS Charlie! Play the song about you. 	6230000	Not Memorable
And leaves. 	6220000	Not Memorable
It was going to be a disaster. 	6210000	Not Memorable
Catherine where did you find this? 	6210000	Not Memorable
What we do see is the floor on which is located the City Room. 	6210000	Not Memorable
Feels like a franchise. 	6210000	Not Memorable
Let's do it. 	6200000	Not Memorable
SAM (CONT'D) You get lost? 	6200000	Not Memorable
Bernstein stares at him. 	6190000	Not Memorable
RIGGAN Thanks for coming on such short notice, Mike. ,	6190000	Not Memorable
They all look at Mike. 	6190000	Not Memorable
It's pulling alongside them. 	6190000	Not Memorable
I'm up in it a little bit here and I need something. 	6190000	Not Memorable
Of course, he built it for her - THOMPSON That must have been love. ,	6180000	Not Memorable
Chris fires and the GUARD'S HEAD explodes. 	6160000	Not Memorable
GENERAL HUX We have their location. 	6150000	Not Memorable
Mark is BLANK-FACED. Just waiting for it to end. 	6150000	Not Memorable
BRAND That doesn't help this planet. 	6150000	Not Memorable
Brand shines her flashlight over the ice again, but nothing happens. ,	6150000	Not Memorable
THOMPSON That's all I'm interested in. 	6150000	Not Memorable
MIA I have an audition. 	6150000	Not Memorable
INT. CAR ON MERRITT PARKWAY The terrain turns to upscale country. 	6150000	Not Memorable
Mia snaps out of it. 	6150000	Not Memorable
In the gym. 	6140000	Not Memorable
They can't hurt us if we're unarmed. 	6130000	Not Memorable
I'll just sit with him; I want to show respect. 	6130000	Not Memorable
DOYLE We're being pulled into it? 	6120000	Not Memorable
ANNIE What's the headline? 	6110000	Not Memorable
Surprised, the women laugh, too. ,	6100000	Not Memorable
K, see you soon... ,	6100000	Not Memorable
Henry waits for more... doesn't get it. 	6100000	Not Memorable

MIA (takes this in; then --) Congratulations. 	6090000	Not Memorable
Finally, alone again. ,	6090000	Not Memorable
Mia takes this in. 	6080000	Not Memorable
He's still an outsider here - but something's changed in him. 88. 	6070000	Not Memorable
I want you to save for a down payment. 	6060000	Not Memorable
