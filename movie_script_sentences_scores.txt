LA LA LAND Written by Damien Chazelle FADE IN... ,850000
A sun-blasted sky. ,2650000
We HEAR radios -- one piece of music after another... ,4210000
We're -- 1 EXT. 101 FREEWAY - DAY Cars are at a standstill. ,501000
It's a horrific traffic jam. ,1350000
Morning rush hour. ,4740000
Sun beating down, asphalt shimmering in the heat. ,837000
The blown-out downtown L.A. skyline hovers in the distance. ,43400
We DRIFT past more CARS. Hear one snippet of audio after another... ,106000
One driver taps his steering wheel to PROG ROCK. Another sings to OPERA. A third raps along to a HIP-HOP track. ,10500
We move from a RADIO INTERVIEW to a FRENCH BALLAD to TECHNO, until finally we begin to hear... ...a new, original piece of music... [ANOTHER DAY OF SUN] We settle on the CAR from which this new tune is playing. ,62000
The driver is a YOUNG WOMAN. She hums along to the riff on her radio -- then starts SINGING. Then -- she EXITS her car. ,137000
Then -- she starts MOVING down the lane. ,8480000
One by one, more DRIVERS join her -- SINGING and DANCING along. ,418000
Without a single cut, we've found ourselves in a FULL- FLEDGED MUSICAL NUMBER... ,234000
Drivers leap on car-tops, dance Jerome Robbins-style, making use of the road and the hot gleam of the automobiles. ,355
Arms swaying, feet banging, dancers darting, as the MUSIC blasts. ,12200
We WEAVE and SWIRL and DART between and around the cars, taking the magic in... ,191000
Finally -- all the drivers swing back into their vehicles -- and the song comes to a dramatic stop. ,229000
Flash title card: WINTER A1 We settle on a new car. ,750000
A 1983 Dodge Riviera. ,2610000
In it is SEBASTIAN, 32, L.A. native. ,58900000
He's listening to the radio. ,1640000
He's playing a track on his music system -- a tape of Thelonious Monk's "Japanese Folk Song". ,2520000
But he keeps stopping it, over and over and over -- always rewinding to the same exact spot. ,23500
Revision 2. ,710000
B1 OMIT C1 We DRIFT from his car to one further up ahead. ,88700
A light-green 2005 Prius. ,1720000
Inside is MIA, 27, Nevada-raised. ,62800
Six years of "no" in L.A. have toughened her, but she's still a dreamer. ,3050000
She seems to be on the phone, speaking into her car's system. ,3850000
Fast, fiery, full of energy -- MIA ...and I swear to God, she was wrecked. ,24700
It was pure insanity. ,725000
Mia stops. ,1840
Thinks. ,14000000
Mutters to herself: "Insanity"... ,52600
Then leans down and grabs a piece of paper from the passenger seat. ,430000
It's a SCRIPT. MIA (CONT'D) (reading now) Pure lunacy. ,6500
Oh God, I know... ,3010000
Just then -- the traffic around Mia starts to let up. ,78900
She's too focused on her lines to notice. ,14400000
Then -- a long, sustained honk behind her: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHT. Mia comes to. ,9280
Jerked back to reality. ,34600
The honking car behind her swerves into the next lane. ,12600
It's Sebastian. ,154000
Mia gives him the finger. ,416000
We then FOLLOW her as she drives... 2 OMIT 3 OMIT 4 INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY Mia works, photos of Hollywood icons on the wall behind her, as -- CUSTOMER #1 This doesn't taste like almond milk. ,4420
MIA Don't worry, it is. ,1200000
I know sometimes it -- CUSTOMER #1 Can I see the carton? ,4010000
Mia hands it over. ,46400
The Customer looks. ,795000
CUSTOMER #1 (CONT'D) I'll have a black coffee. ,25700000
Mia gets the coffee. ,320000
Quickly sneaks a look at a script hidden underneath her counter. ,82200
The same one we saw in her car... ,6470000
Revision 3. ,565000
She hands the coffee to the Customer. ,398000
We follow the Customer out through the door -- as a WOMAN walks into the shop. ,2950000
We don't see the Woman's face, but we see all the eyes in the shop turn immediately to her. ,2440000
We see one CUSTOMER whisper to another, discreetly pointing as the WOMAN passes by... ,15100
WOMAN Cappuccino, please. ,6940000
Mia nods. ,1780
Gets it made. ,1560000
The Manager takes it from her. ,47800000
MANAGER On us. ,11900000
WOMAN No, I insist. ,2730000
She pays. ,313000
Then smiles at Mia and drops a bill in the tip jar. ,283000
Mia watches as the Woman walks off, is joined by a STUDIO EMPLOYEE on a golf cart outside -- we realize this coffee shop is on a STUDIO LOT -- and is driven away... ,20800
Then -- Mia's phone rings. ,1420000
It reads: "MOM". Mia presses "IGNORE" and the time pops up on the phone's screen: 4:07. ,58100
MIA Shit. ,1660
Removing her apron and hurrying out, turning back as -- MANAGER Where do you think you're going? ,10400
MIA It's -- five past... ,13000000
MANAGER You'd better be here early tomorrow. ,34500000
MIA Ok. -- then realizes she doesn't have her script, runs back to grab it, hurries on and then -- CRASHES into a table. ,2890
Coffee and food spill all over her shirt, and all at once we're -- 5 INT. AUDITION ROOM - DAY Mia's in a thick winter coat, covering her stained shirt. ,42100
On her cell, loudly laughing while her adrenaline surges -- MIA (CONT'D) And I swear to God, she was wrecked. ,12200
It was pure lunacy. ,34
Oh God, I know... ,3560000
Revision 4. ,411000
Her nerves are practically visible. ,144000
As she talks, we PULL BACK -- to see that she's auditioning for a CASTING DIRECTOR. MIA (CONT'D) No, no, Turner's fine. ,30700
So you -- are you waiting `til Denver to tell her...? (as her smile contracts) Oh. I see... (silence; she clenches her jaw...) No, you're right. ,88
I understand. (...and a tear falls from her eye) Ok... ,2130000
I just... ,15500000
Oh... ,24500000
An ASSISTANT appears through the glass on the door behind Mia, waving to the Casting Director: Yoohoo. ,4740
Can I come in? ,154000000
MIA (CONT'D) (crying now) No, I'm happy for you... ,1640000
I -- I just -- CASTING DIRECTOR One second. ,5000000
Mia stops. ,1750
The Casting Director waves the Assistant in. ,3180000
The Assistant scurries in, shows her boss a post-it. ,2
Mia stands there, trying to hold onto the tears, hold onto the emotion, as the Casting Director reads the post-it and thinks. ,47000
CASTING DIRECTOR (CONT'D) ...I'll call her back. ,930000
Tell her I'm almost done in here. ,88200
The Assistant nods. ,2110000
Walks out. ,1440000
Mia waits, trying to maintain... ,150000
CASTING DIRECTOR (CONT'D) You know what? ,94800000
I think we're good. ,81800000
Thanks for coming in. ,1020000
Mia looks at her. ,39700
A beat. 6 INT. LOBBY - DAY Mia exits. ,253000
Nerves still on edge. ,1110000
Passes one beautiful redhead after the next -- all getting ready to cry. ,1080000
Enters the elevator with two other WOMEN -- tall, statuesque. ,71800
Also redheads. 7 INT. MIA'S APARTMENT - EARLY EVENING Mia enters. ,21300
Exhausted. ,7090000
Heads to her ROOM. Revision 5. ,65200000
Old movie posters hang on the walls, including a big Ingrid Bergman one over the bed. ,13900
There's also a shelf filled with acting books -- Uta Hagen, Stella Adler. ,118000
Various other trinkets: an old globe, an old blue-and-red suitcase. ,285000
Mia takes off her shoe. ,27700
A blister on her sole. 8 WE CUT TO: Mia in the BATHROOM. Just showered, wrapped in a towel. ,27600
She hums to herself. ,278000
The mirror is fogged up. ,79000000
She turns off the vent. ,9190000
The mist on the glass thickens. ,2320000
She dabs some of it away. ,2
Dims the lights. ,483000
Looks... ,17500000
With the fog in place, her reflection looks like one of those soft-focus old Hollywood close-ups. ,38200
She hums as she brushes her hair... ,36600
Then -- the door SWINGS open -- and the spell is broken. ,97400
TRACY Holy Mother of God. ,1180000
Mia snaps out of it. ,12900000
Turns. ,15400000
Fog is enveloping TRACY, 27. ,12100
TRACY (CONT'D) Ever heard of a vent? ,16600
MIA I wanted to give you an entrance. ,111000000
ALEXIS (appearing in the hall, 26, eating Cheetos) Mia! How'd it go? ,102000
MIA Eh... ,7000
ALEXIS Same here. ,9180000
Was Jen there? ,89
Or Rachel? ,113000
MIA I don't know who Jen and Rachel are. ,499000
ALEXIS They're the worst. ,690000
MIA I don't know if they were there. ,92400000
As Mia slips away -- ALEXIS I bet they were. ,23900
Revision 6. ,265000
CAITLIN (appearing, 27) Why is there a convention in the bathroom? ,2980000
TRACY Two minutes, people! Mia you're coming, right? ,306000
WE PAN TO find Mia poking her head out of her bedroom -- MIA Can't. ,62600
Working. ,21700000
TRACY (O.S.) What? (we PAN BACK to Tracy) Did she say "working"? ,3650000
A8 We follow Mia INSIDE her room. ,36100000
She closes the door. ,2800000
Takes a moment. ,9450000
You can tell in her eyes -- work or not, a night on the town is the last thing she wants to do now. ,637000
B8 WE CUT to the HALLWAY, to find Tracy POUNDING on Mia's door. ,138000
MIA (opening up) Yes? ,5200000
TRACY Look, I know things didn't go well today. ,14000000
There are four things in my inbox that you're perfect for and I will submit you. ,15500000
But right now -- you're coming. ,158000
C8 With that -- she barges in and beelines to Mia's closet -- TRACY (CONT'D) It'll be fun. ,8020
MIA It'll be a bunch of social climbers packed into one of those glass houses. ,8120
TRACY Exactly. ,1090
Fun. ,25100000
She pulls out a blue dress. ,33600000
As Alexis hurries in -- TRACY (CONT'D) MIA This looks familiar. ,2950
I was going to give it back! Alexis moves from Mia's perfume to the dress, lighting up as she grabs it -- Revision 7. ,10100
ALEXIS Come on, Mia. ,991000
When else do you get to see every Hollywood cliché crammed into a single home? ,400000
TRACY (faux-offended) Lex! I'm disappointed in you. ,14500
There's nothing to make fun of. ,46700000
This party will be humanity at its finest. ,143000
Mia rolls her eyes -- and, with that -- Tracy BREAKS INTO SONG. [SOMEONE IN THE CROWD] She play-acts the clichés this party will represent. ,47700
Alexis and Caitlin join in, giddy and playful. ,14900
Mia can't help but laugh. ,10100000
The roommates sing and dance, hoping to persuade Mia to join the night's revelry... ,179000
Mia remains reluctant. ,809000
Stays behind in her room as her roommates head out the door. ,258000
But she's starting to wonder: A night at home, feeling sorry for herself -- or a night out with her friends...? 9 EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING / STREET - NIGHT We're outside now, and BACK with Tracy, Alexis and Caitlin, marching across the courtyard and toward the street. ,13300
They sing, dance, half-assuming Mia is a no-go -- -- until Mia APPEARS, blue-dress-clad. ,31300
Her roommates look at her in surprise -- then delight. ,2
The energy swells and the four characters dance their way together down the street. ,7330000
They dive into a single CAR, and WE DISSOLVE TO... 10 OMIT. A10 OMIT. 11 EXT. CITY - NIGHT An old-fashioned MONTAGE of a night on the town: neon signs and overflowing champagne glasses. ,21
Soon enough, we're at... 12 EXT. MODERN HILLTOP HOUSE - NIGHT Valet cars lined up. ,8260
We FOLLOW Alexis, Tracy, Caitlin and Mia to the door... 13 INT./EXT. HILLTOP HOUSE - NIGHT ...and into a big-glass hilltop pad. ,19100
We FOLLOW Mia as she takes in her surroundings. ,2
Revision 8. ,250000
A D.J. turning tables. ,96800000
A FAT OLD PRODUCER dancing with a TWENTY-SOMETHING. A trio of AGENTS glad-handing each other in rhythm by the bar. ,2590
Yep -- every cliché is here... ,1550000
Mia tries talking to a pair of WOMEN -- who promptly ditch her. ,35800
Seeing she's now alone, a YOUNG MAN swoops in to hit on her. ,2140000
She makes a hasty exit toward the bar -- but the line's obscenely long. ,11900
She nears the BATHROOM door -- but a COUPLE stands in her way, making out. ,1520000
She slips in behind them... ,2470000
A13 Inside the BATHROOM, Mia takes a moment. ,2
The joy of seconds ago is gone from her eyes now. ,58700
She gazes into the mirror -- -- and SINGS by herself. ,212000
This verse, sung in private, belongs to a new style: less brash, and far more vulnerable... ,16300
Once finished, Mia takes a breath, steels herself to once again face the world, opens the door -- and rejoins the crowd... ,4400
B13 We MOVE with her slowly now -- surrounded by the party, but everything set at a snail's pace, the crazed carousers moving in SLOW MOTION. It's the sadness underneath the revelry, the pain underneath the clichés... ,5
Gradually we RAMP UP. Follow Mia OUTSIDE, where we see the splash of blue-green that is the POOL -- and a flurry of FAKE SNOW falling from above... ,673
As we reach FULL-SPEED, a PARTY-GOER races to the edge, jumps -- -- and we PLUNGE WITH HIM INTO THE POOL. This is the climax of the number. ,6580
Everyone joins in, circling the pool -- a swath of color against the black sky. ,2440
Everyone dances, everyone sings -- and the song concludes with a blast of fireworks. ,59400
C13 OMIT A14 EXT. STREET - NIGHT Close on a sign: "NO PARKING ANYTIME: TOW-AWAY ZONE". Revision 9. ,66
MIA (O.S.) No... ,689000000
We see Mia -- all alone, staring at the sign. ,131000
No car in sight. ,133000000
She reaches into her purse, pulls out her cell phone to call Tracy. ,85000
It's dead. ,25100000
MIA (CONT'D) No... 15 OMIT 16 OMIT 17 OMIT A17 OMIT B17 OMIT 18 OMIT 19 EXT. HILL / LOS ANGELES STREETS - NIGHT Mia trudges down the steep hill in her unwieldy heels. ,18
She's an hour-and-a-half walk from her place. ,19700000
She crosses roads and lots, navigates stretches where the sidewalk stops and gives way to shrubbery. ,5970
A19 And then -- she hears something... ,2230000
Music. ,36700000
A piano, in the distance. ,334000
And a MELODY -- one we will come to know very well... ,73900000
Without being sure why, she FOLLOWS THE SOUND. Passes several doors. ,1360000
Then stops. ,755000
Has found where it's coming from... ,5870000
She reaches out -- and slowly opens a door... ,2740000
AND WE CUT RIGHT BACK TO: 20 EXT. 101 FREEWAY - EARLIER THAT MORNING AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHT. The same 101 traffic jam we began with. ,10400
This time we're on Sebastian -- the honker. ,1150000
He passes Mia's car. ,17300000
She gives him the finger. ,33500
He drives on, shaking his head... 21 OMIT 22 EXT. RAYO'S - MOMENTS LATER Sebastian sips a coffee as he gazes across the street -- at a 30's Deco building. ,12000
A sign above the door: "VAN BEEK". A newer sub-heading below: "TAPAS & TUNES". Revision 10. ,11600
The door opens. ,14800000
Two EMPLOYEES step out, setting up a valet stand. ,179000
Sebastian watches them -- and shakes his head. ,15100
The employees notice him. ,465000
Recognize him. ,401000
What is it with that guy...? 23A OMIT 23 INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - DAY Sebastian enters his apartment -- cramped, dingy, bare walls, no furniture or decoration, boxes filled with dusty black-and-white photographs and unused instruments on the floor, a black Steinway upright piano in the center of the living room -- and sees a WOMAN rummaging around. ,85
SEBASTIAN You gotta stop breaking into my home. ,302000
She looks up. ,2530000
She's 37 quickly going on 50, and dressed like she doesn't care. ,764000
This is LAURA, Sebastian's older sister. ,338000
LAURA You think Mom or Dad would call this a home? ,2450000
Seeing that she's seated on a stained, decrepit stool -- SEBASTIAN Please don't sit on that. ,6780
LAURA Are you serious? ,17300000
SEBASTIAN Yes. ,8690
Hoagy Carmichael sat on that stool. ,7220
The Baked Potato was gonna throw it away. ,5660000
LAURA I wonder why. (then, rising,) I brought you this. ,247000
It's a throw rug. ,3650000
SEBASTIAN Don't need it. ,429000
LAURA Yeah? ,6640
What if I told you Miles Davis pissed on it? ,270000
SEBASTIAN That's almost insulting... (then,) Did he? ,1540000
Revision 11. ,190000
She shakes her head: Unbelievable. ,1170000
Tosses the rug to the side. ,3030000
LAURA When are you going to unpack these boxes? ,18900
SEBASTIAN When I unpack them in my club. ,2910000
LAURA Oh my God. ,463000
It's like a girl broke up with you and you're stalking her. (then, looks at him --) You're not still going by there, are you? ,1810000
SEBASTIAN No. A beat. ,32700000
Then -- SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) They've turned it into a tapas-samba place. ,5950
You believe that? ,4830000
LAURA Seb -- SEBASTIAN Who wants to tapas while they samba? ,90400
LAURA I have someone I want you to meet. ,156000000
SEBASTIAN I don't want to meet anyone. ,11000000
LAURA You'll like her. ,17000000
SEBASTIAN Uh-huh. ,1050000
Does she like jazz? ,41700000
LAURA Probably not. ,78600000
SEBASTIAN Then what are we gonna talk about? ,3090000
LAURA You'll talk about the weather. ,797000
SEBASTIAN Ok. Then I have someone I'd like you to meet. ,3370000
He's got a face tattoo, but a heart of gold. ,1420000
Revision 12. ,177000
LAURA Sebastian -- SEBASTIAN How long's it been? ,200000
LAURA You need to get serious. ,757000
You live like a hermit. ,1080000
You're driving without insurance. ,884000
SEBASTIAN I am serious. ,1580000
I had a very serious plan for my future. ,36400000
It's not my fault I got Shanghai'ed. ,6510000
LAURA You did not get "Shanghai'ed", you got ripped off. ,562000
SEBASTIAN What's the difference? ,103000000
LAURA It's not as romantic as that. (she starts to walk off) And everyone knew that guy was shady except for you. ,25200
SEBASTIAN Why do you say romantic like it's a dirty word? ,2480000
LAURA Unpaid bills are not romantic. ,156000
Call her. ,1890000
She heads to the door. ,505000
He follows her, won't give it up -- SEBASTIAN You're acting like life's got me on the ropes -- what you don't understand is, I want to be on the ropes. ,1580
I'm letting life hit me `til it gets tired. ,3920000
Then I'm gonna make my move. ,5170000
It's a classic rope-a-dope. ,218000
Laura can't help but laugh. ,1040000
Stops by the door. ,15
Looks at him. ,1520000
LAURA I love you. ,199000000
Unpack your boxes. ,79400000
SEBASTIAN I'm changing the locks. ,89800
Revision 13. ,258000
LAURA (out the door with a smile --) You can't afford it. ,223000
She's gone. ,2550000
Sebastian thinks for a beat, then calls out -- SEBASTIAN I'm a phoenix rising from the ashes! No reply to his triumphant declaration. ,36800
He shuts the door. ,1280000
Looks again at the napkin. ,3090000
Thinks. ,14100000
Tosses it in the trash. ,4750000
A23 INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - LATER Moments later. ,10600
Sebastian takes a slice of pizza from the fridge, pours himself some more coffee, places a Thelonious Monk LP onto a record player, and sits down at the piano. "Japanese Folk Song" -- the piece we heard in his car -- plays... ,93
Sebastian plays along. ,2210000
Stops. ,14900000
Moves the record back a few bars. ,200000
Starts it again. ,526000
Plays the same passage over. ,4730000
Stops. ,14900000
Moves the record back a second time. ,2880000
Plays the passage again. ,2050000
Stops. ,14900000
Over and over, just like in his car -- until, finally, he gets it right. ,1210000
He keeps playing, louder now, and we're -- B23 OMIT 24 OMIT 25 OMIT 26 OMIT 27 INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT A red-booth bar-and-restaurant. ,699
Christmas decorations all over. ,2600000
Sebastian steps in. ,10300000
Immediately beelining over -- BOSS Seb. ,14
SEBASTIAN (putting on a smile) Bill. ,70900
Thanks for having me back. ,378000
BOSS Your welcome. ,45600000
Stick to the set list. ,1750000
Revision 14. ,126000
SEBASTIAN Of course. (under his breath as he heads to the piano) Though I don't think they care what I play. ,202000
BOSS I do, and I don't want to hear the free jazz. ,4320000
SEBASTIAN How `bout one for you, one for me? ,197000000
Or two for you, one for me? (the Boss just glares) Or all for you, none for me? ,1980000
Ok, that works. ,25600000
Good deal. ,8760000
Sebastian sits down at the keys. ,59800
A WAITRESS passes by. ,280000
WAITRESS Well... ,7200
Welcome back. ,14600000
SEBASTIAN There's a nice way to say that. ,4430000
With that -- he starts playing "Jingle Bells". 28 INT. RESTAURANT - LATER The restaurant's demographic has changed. ,1200
It's now younger stragglers wandering in. ,25200
Sebastian looks beyond bored. ,657000
He finishes "We Wish You a Merry Christmas". ,1030000
Zero applause. ,1400
He begins a new chart: "Deck the Halls". ,867000
But something seems to come over him now. ,1950000
He's restless. ,6690000
Slowly, his playing drifts off -- his fingers charting their own path... ,14200
And then -- we hear a melody. ,1470000
The one Mia heard outside. ,825000
The one we'll refer to from now on as Mia and Sebastian's song... ,181000
The door opens -- and Mia steps in. ,695000
She sees Sebastian at the piano. ,24000
Is instantly struck by his playing. [MIA AND SEBASTIAN'S THEME] Gradually -- all sounds but the music drop out. ,4720
We drift away from reality. ,2420000
Even the walls seem to go slightly darker -- as though Sebastian and Mia were all alone... ,154000
He concludes his piece with a jumble of chords, his playing almost free jazz now, as we pull back to real life... ...and see the Boss looking on in scorn. ,1150
Revision 15. ,127000
Sebastian finishes. ,1720
Silence. ,15400000
Mia looks like the wind has been knocked out of her. ,185000
Sebastian looks up for a second -- and sees her. ,2020000
They look at one another. ,7970
Just a moment. ,9690000
Then -- the Boss taps Sebastian on the shoulder. ,37200
WE STAY ON Mia as she watches Sebastian rise with the Boss. ,218000
We just see the Boss talking to Sebastian, can't hear what is said. ,1430000
Then, we get closer -- and realize: BOSS ...every goddamned night. ,68000
Sebastian is silent. ,8170000
Then, doesn't want to have to beg but -- SEBASTIAN I'll stick to the set list, I promise -- BOSS Too late. ,239000
You're done. ,2660000
SEBASTIAN You're not gonna find a better player. ,8020000
You know that. ,147000000
BOSS (leans in, and --) Do you think anyone here gives a shit? ,18000
With that, the Boss walks off. ,6460000
We linger on Sebastian. ,4580000
Anger giving way -- to hurt. ,1980000
He starts hurrying toward the door. ,3520000
BACK TO Mia -- who didn't hear what was said. ,12100000
She watches Sebastian -- takes a breath, so moved that she's about to lay it all out -- swoops in to corner him -- and -- MIA I just wanted to say -- I saw your playing, and I -- -- but Sebastian just walks right by -- his shoulder bumping against Mia's for an added measure of disdain. ,471
He heads out the door. ,24500000
Slams it shut. ,5740000
Mia is left standing on her own. ,10400000
She looks like she's just been slapped. ,3040000
SMASH CUT TO BLACK. Revision 16. ,45800
SPRING 29 OMIT 30 INT. AUDITION ROOMS - DAY Mia auditions. ,546000
Pilot season cattle-call -- a series of soul- crushing try-outs. ,304000
She's pandering to the hilt. ,8230
Quick glimpses: MIA (CONT'D) I don't like the fissure on the GT scan. ,59
Did you test for achromatopsia? 31 Then, a second audition -- MIA (CONT'D) D.O.A. on 23rd, perp laughing his face off at P.D. ,16
Damn Miranda Rights. 32 And finally, a third audition -- MIA (CONT'D) This is my classroom. ,242000
You don't like it, the door's to my left. ,90100000
READER (O.S.) (a well-dressed forty-year-old WOMAN reading from sides) Lady why you be trippin' like that? ,2450
MIA No, Jamal. ,335000
You be trippin'. 34 EXT. PARTY - DAY Mia wanders around another party. ,11600
A BAD 80's COVER BAND plays. ,2180000
TRACY There you are! You need to meet someone! Carlo, this is Mia. ,1290000
Mia, Carlo's a writer. ,1740000
CARLO TRACY Nice to meet you, Mia. ,158000
He's got projects all over town. ,81400000
CARLO (shrugs, faux-modest) They say I have a knack for world-building. ,29800
MIA (takes this in; then --) Congratulations. ,5230000
I have to grab a drink... ,40000000
Revision 17. ,135000
She slips away. ,630000
Presses toward the bar. ,51000
The music gets louder, more obnoxious. ,814000
She peers toward the band to get a look... ,2240000
And then she sees him. ,3620000
Sebastian. ,16200000
Playing keyboard-guitar for the band. ,2470000
Dressed up like his band- mates in a bright polyester outfit. ,453000
And hating every second. ,2830000
The band finishes, and the SINGER addresses the (thin) crowd. ,265000
SINGER Alright, one more for y'all before we break. ,1780000
Do I hear any requests? ,250000
MIA "I Ran". ,129000
Sebastian turns. ,3470
Sees Mia, looking at him with a defiant grin, enjoying her power. ,85100
He thinks -- then recognizes the face. ,1260000
SINGER "I Ran" it is. (to Sebastian) Wanna start us off, piano-man? ,16100000
Sebastian stays silent. ,527000
Mortified. ,678000
Finally, so reluctant, he taps his keyboard to count the band in and begins playing. ,33300
On the keys, it's a single note, repeated measure after measure. ,107000
Mia knew this. ,12400000
Sebastian looks at her. ,3730000
She smiles right back. ,2890000
SINGER (CONT'D) I walked along the avenue... 35 EXT. PARTY / INT. HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER Set break. ,732
Sebastian hurries from the keys -- enters the house, looks both ways, finally spots Mia and -- SEBASTIAN Ok. I remember you. ,18200
Mia looks at him. ,5410000
One eyebrow raised. ,7990000
Yeah? ,17600000
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) And I'm sorry if I was curt that night. ,272000
MIA "Curt"? ,306000
SEBASTIAN Ok I was an asshole. ,1690000
I can admit that. ,10500000
Revision 18. ,111000
MIA Ok. SEBASTIAN But requesting "I Ran" from a serious musician -- it's too far. ,178000
MIA My God. ,1120000
Did you just call yourself "a serious musician"? ,1520000
SEBASTIAN (beat) I don't think so. ,54900
MIA Can I borrow what you're wearing? ,21300000
SEBASTIAN Why? ,6910
MIA Because I have an audition next week. ,135000
I'm playing a serious fire-fighter. ,181000
SEBASTIAN (irritation building --) So you're an actress. ,465000
That makes sense. ,1180000
Have I seen you in anything? ,33400000
MIA Uh... ,4610
The coffee shop on the Warner Brothers lot. ,467000
That's a classic. ,25900000
SEBASTIAN Oh, you're a barista. ,398000
Well now I see how you can look down on me from all the way up there. ,57700000
SINGER (popping in from nowhere) Sebastian. ,51500
Second set. ,807000
Sebastian looks at Mia. ,1880000
She smirks. ,16400
Pleased. ,14300000
The Singer walks off. ,10100000
SEBASTIAN He doesn't tell me what to do. ,74400000
MIA He just told you what to do. ,81200000
SEBASTIAN I let him. ,2
Revision 19. ,89200
A beat. ,9640000
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) What's your name? ,91700000
MIA Mia. ,522000
SEBASTIAN Mia. ,4390
Guess I'll see you in the movies. ,75900000
He heads back to the keys, and the band resumes: SINGER Never seen you lookin' so lovely as you did tonight... 36 EXT. PARTY / STREET - NIGHT The party's finished. ,64300
Sebastian exits, pulling out his keys, as we DRIFT and see a long line to the VALET. Standing way in the back, waiting, is Mia. ,43000
She's stuck once again with CARLO, who's regaling her -- CARLO ...Goldilocks from the point of view of the bears. ,44700
Home-invasion thriller. ,2040000
Fox and Warners are going crazy for it. ,33500
Mia spots Sebastian, passing by the Valet with his keys. ,32800
CARLO (CONT'D) ...We're going after Charlize. ,38500
For the bear. ,9800000
We're flipping it. ,1150000
Feels like a franchise. ,6210000
But the thing is it's grounded. ,80000000
MIA (to Sebastian) George Michael! Sebastian stops. ,91600
Looks at her. ,3340000
Surprised. ,12700000
SEBASTIAN You again. ,222000
MIA Did you just get your keys? ,34000000
Sebastian thinks. ,10500
Sees the Valet. ,6810000
Playing it off -- SEBASTIAN ...Yeah. ,1890000
Revision 20. ,216000
MIA Can you grab mine? ,2160000
SEBASTIAN ...Which one is it? ,32700000
MIA The Prius. ,201000
A beat. ,9630000
Sebastian turns to the Valet's box. ,434000
Motions to the Valet: Sorry. ,4870000
One second. ,1810000
Looks. ,17500000
All the keys are Prius keys. ,341000
MIA (CONT'D) The one with the green ribbon. ,192000
Another beat. ,86100
Sebastian finds it. ,8440000
Grabs it. 37 EXT. STREET - NIGHT Mia and Sebastian trudge up a hill lined with cars. ,6490
Mia aims her key fob. ,344000
No beep. ,146000
Sebastian points his own keys, also aiming for a beep. ,125000
Silence. ,15400000
They've been at this for a while. ,124000
MIA (CONT'D) (almost tripping in her heels) Shit... ,10000
SEBASTIAN Those look comfortable. ,2460000
MIA They are...n't. ,13900
A beat. ,9710000
She aims again. ,96
No beep. ,154000
MIA (CONT'D) Thank you for saving the day back there. ,112000
SEBASTIAN You didn't give me much of a choice. ,28700000
MIA Strange that we keep running into each other. ,426000
SEBASTIAN It is strange. ,4260000
Maybe it means something. ,4830000
MIA I doubt it. ,3510000
SEBASTIAN Yeah I don't think so either. ,3330000
Revision 21. ,196000
On that, Mia aims again. ,512000
As always -- no beep. ,2800000
Noticing -- SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Put the clicker under your chin. ,70600
MIA What? ,54700
Sebastian demonstrates with his fob. ,145000
He looks idiotic. ,7720000
SEBASTIAN It turns your head into an antenna. ,18700000
Probably gives you cancer, but you find your car more quickly. ,6370000
MIA Uh-huh. ,174000
SEBASTIAN You don't live as long, but you get things done faster, so it all evens out. ,94700
MIA Oh my God. ,399000
Just then, they reach a clearing -- AND THE CITY SKYLINE APPEARS BELOW. A ribbon of lights, stretching as far as you can see. ,19400
It's the most romantic sight imaginable. ,32300
They look at each other. ,383000
A beat. ,9680000
And then -- MIA (CONT'D) Eh. They walk on, the lights shimmering behind. ,7840
SEBASTIAN Not much to look at. ,14400000
MIA Agreed. ,2200
I've seen better. ,1930000
And on that -- they SING. [A LOVELY NIGHT] Mia and Sebastian try to downplay the romanticism of this setting, this moment -- being lost here, at night, alone together, atop a hill, the city glittering before them. ,2880
It's "no big deal", nothing they haven't seen or felt before -- because, after all, there's no chance for romance between them... ,15300000
Of course, the music, swelling and building, suggests otherwise. ,24200000
Mia tires of her heels, finds a bench and fishes for flats in her handbag. ,45300
Sebastian sits beside her as she slips the flats on. ,11000
They look at each other, suspicious... ,16300000
Revision 22. ,88200
He moves his foot. ,1140000
She moves hers. ,8240000
They look at each other again. ,16400000
Still suspicious... ,37800
He moves again. ,1210000
She moves again. ,1170000
They seem to be moving in sync -- without their even wanting to... ,3700000
And -- bit by bit -- before our eyes -- they've almost slipped into DANCE... ,138000
Sebastian rises. ,1360
Mia rises as well. ,347000
The two look at each other. ,11100000
Run back to the bench, hop atop it -- the lights stretch out like a magic carpet. ,198000
They share a moment -- share a look -- jump off -- AND START REALLY DANCING NOW... ,211000
Mia does a move, Sebastian responds. ,256000
Sebastian does a move, Mia shakes her head: "Nope". ,143000
They make the road their own, growing more and more energized, as surprised as we are to find -- ...that they can really dance together. ,46200
Just as this starts to look like a blossoming romance, real joy peeking through, our two heroes getting closer and closer and closer, looking at each other almost giddily... ...a sound cuts through. ,59
It's a CELL PHONE ring. ,746000
Mia and Sebastian turn -- to her handbag, back by the bench. ,176000
Snapped out of it, Mia heads over and pulls out her cell. ,1640000
MIA (CONT'D) Hey... ,61700
Greg...? ,16100000
Can you hear me...? ,10800000
Yeah, I'm just leaving now... ,36200000
K, see you soon... ,6100000
She hangs up. ,11400000
Looks at Sebastian. ,3670
An awkward silence. ,8210000
Finally -- she presses her fob again. ,777000
Puts it under her chin this time. ,2310000
A BEEP can be heard. ,425000
They see her Prius. ,27800000
MIA (CONT'D) Ah. Great... ,83400
Well... ,22400000
Do you want a ride to your car? ,1830000
SEBASTIAN No, that's fine... ,26000000
Thanks... ,20500000
MIA ...Ok... ,1360000
Not sure what else to say, she heads to her vehicle. ,671000
Waves. ,15300000
MIA (CONT'D) Night. ,189000
Sebastian waves back. ,719000
Mia drives off. ,590000
Fast. ,22700000
Silence... ,15300000
Revision 23. ,138000
Looking even more disappointed than he thought he'd be, Sebastian walks on for a bit -- then retreats back down. ,9020
A37 Comes to a stop across from the party, and we see his Riviera -- right, it seems, where he knew it was all along. ,6920
He pulls out his keys -- they don't have a clicker after all. 38 OMIT 39 INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY CLOSE on -- CUSTOMER Are these pastries gluten-free? ,18200
Mia's at work. ,1240000000
A typically chaotic day. ,2150000
MIA No... ,16400000
CUSTOMER What?? ,375000
I want a refund. ,2080000
Mia nods, heads to the Manager -- MANAGER You're closing up Friday. ,61300
MIA I have an audition. ,6150000
Remember? ,20900000
MANAGER Do I look like I care? ,79500000
Reschedule it. ,80200
MIA But you said -- MANAGER And fix your apron. ,211000
Enters the elevator with two other WOMEN -- tall, statuesque. ,72300
Also redheads. 7 INT. MIA'S APARTMENT - EARLY EVENING Mia enters. ,9160
Exhausted. ,7070000
Heads to her ROOM. Revision 5. ,66400000
Old movie posters hang on the walls, including a big Ingrid Bergman one over the bed. ,722
There's also a shelf filled with acting books -- Uta Hagen, Stella Adler. ,61500
Various other trinkets: an old globe, an old blue-and-red suitcase. ,286000
Mia takes off her shoe. ,31200
A blister on her sole. 8 WE CUT TO: Mia in the BATHROOM. Just showered, wrapped in a towel. ,26600
She hums to herself. ,277000
The mirror is fogged up. ,78700000
She turns off the vent. ,9390000
The mist on the glass thickens. ,2250000
Dims the lights. ,456000
Looks... ,17300000
With the fog in place, her reflection looks like one of those soft-focus old Hollywood close-ups. ,29600
Then -- the door SWINGS open -- and the spell is broken. ,88700
Mia snaps out of it. ,12600000
TRACY (CONT'D) Ever heard of a vent? ,16800
ALEXIS (appearing in the hall, 26, eating Cheetos) Mia! How'd it go? ,114000
MIA Eh... ,7010
Or Rachel? ,114000
MIA I don't know who Jen and Rachel are. ,506000
ALEXIS They're the worst. ,705000
MIA I don't know if they were there. ,92300000
As Mia slips away -- ALEXIS I bet they were. ,24100
Revision 6. ,270000
CAITLIN (appearing, 27) Why is there a convention in the bathroom? ,11500000
TRACY Two minutes, people! Mia you're coming, right? ,290000
WE PAN TO find Mia poking her head out of her bedroom -- MIA Can't. ,57200
Working. ,21800000
She closes the door. ,2930000
Takes a moment. ,9440000
You can tell in her eyes -- work or not, a night on the town is the last thing she wants to do now. ,416000
B8 WE CUT to the HALLWAY, to find Tracy POUNDING on Mia's door. ,146000
MIA (opening up) Yes? ,5860000
TRACY Look, I know things didn't go well today. ,11100000
There are four things in my inbox that you're perfect for and I will submit you. ,15300000
But right now -- you're coming. ,149000
C8 With that -- she barges in and beelines to Mia's closet -- TRACY (CONT'D) It'll be fun. ,10400
MIA It'll be a bunch of social climbers packed into one of those glass houses. ,7990
TRACY Exactly. ,1070
Fun. ,25300000
As Alexis hurries in -- TRACY (CONT'D) MIA This looks familiar. ,15200
ALEXIS Come on, Mia. ,993000
When else do you get to see every Hollywood cliché crammed into a single home? ,418000
TRACY (faux-offended) Lex! I'm disappointed in you. ,18500
There's nothing to make fun of. ,46800000
This party will be humanity at its finest. ,176000
Mia rolls her eyes -- and, with that -- Tracy BREAKS INTO SONG. [SOMEONE IN THE CROWD] She play-acts the clichés this party will represent. ,47200
Mia can't help but laugh. ,10600000
Mia remains reluctant. ,820000
Stays behind in her room as her roommates head out the door. ,262000
But she's starting to wonder: A night at home, feeling sorry for herself -- or a night out with her friends...? 9 EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING / STREET - NIGHT We're outside now, and BACK with Tracy, Alexis and Caitlin, marching across the courtyard and toward the street. ,11300
The energy swells and the four characters dance their way together down the street. ,3000000
They dive into a single CAR, and WE DISSOLVE TO... 10 OMIT. A10 OMIT. 11 EXT. CITY - NIGHT An old-fashioned MONTAGE of a night on the town: neon signs and overflowing champagne glasses. ,24
Soon enough, we're at... 12 EXT. MODERN HILLTOP HOUSE - NIGHT Valet cars lined up. ,8220
We FOLLOW Alexis, Tracy, Caitlin and Mia to the door... 13 INT./EXT. HILLTOP HOUSE - NIGHT ...and into a big-glass hilltop pad. ,17300
Revision 8. ,238000
A D.J. turning tables. ,96900000
A FAT OLD PRODUCER dancing with a TWENTY-SOMETHING. A trio of AGENTS glad-handing each other in rhythm by the bar. ,3220
Yep -- every cliché is here... ,1540000
Mia tries talking to a pair of WOMEN -- who promptly ditch her. ,34300
Seeing she's now alone, a YOUNG MAN swoops in to hit on her. ,2340000
She nears the BATHROOM door -- but a COUPLE stands in her way, making out. ,4890000
She slips in behind them... ,2340000
The joy of seconds ago is gone from her eyes now. ,42900
She gazes into the mirror -- -- and SINGS by herself. ,218000
This verse, sung in private, belongs to a new style: less brash, and far more vulnerable... ,18000
Once finished, Mia takes a breath, steels herself to once again face the world, opens the door -- and rejoins the crowd... ,4380
B13 We MOVE with her slowly now -- surrounded by the party, but everything set at a snail's pace, the crazed carousers moving in SLOW MOTION. It's the sadness underneath the revelry, the pain underneath the clichés... ,4
Gradually we RAMP UP. Follow Mia OUTSIDE, where we see the splash of blue-green that is the POOL -- and a flurry of FAKE SNOW falling from above... ,676
As we reach FULL-SPEED, a PARTY-GOER races to the edge, jumps -- -- and we PLUNGE WITH HIM INTO THE POOL. This is the climax of the number. ,6470
Everyone dances, everyone sings -- and the song concludes with a blast of fireworks. ,55700
C13 OMIT A14 EXT. STREET - NIGHT Close on a sign: "NO PARKING ANYTIME: TOW-AWAY ZONE". Revision 9. ,65
MIA (O.S.) No... ,651000000
We see Mia -- all alone, staring at the sign. ,133000
She reaches into her purse, pulls out her cell phone to call Tracy. ,93800
It's dead. ,33100000
She's an hour-and-a-half walk from her place. ,19800000
She crosses roads and lots, navigates stretches where the sidewalk stops and gives way to shrubbery. ,5940
A19 And then -- she hears something... ,2300000
Music. ,36900000
A piano, in the distance. ,333000
And a MELODY -- one we will come to know very well... ,57000000
Without being sure why, she FOLLOWS THE SOUND. Passes several doors. ,1320000
Then stops. ,760000
Has found where it's coming from... ,5010000
AND WE CUT RIGHT BACK TO: 20 EXT. 101 FREEWAY - EARLIER THAT MORNING AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHT. The same 101 traffic jam we began with. ,14200
She gives him the finger. ,33100
He drives on, shaking his head... 21 OMIT 22 EXT. RAYO'S - MOMENTS LATER Sebastian sips a coffee as he gazes across the street -- at a 30's Deco building. ,12300
A sign above the door: "VAN BEEK". A newer sub-heading below: "TAPAS & TUNES". Revision 10. ,9150
The door opens. ,11000000
Two EMPLOYEES step out, setting up a valet stand. ,201000
Sebastian watches them -- and shakes his head. ,36300
The employees notice him. ,463000
Recognize him. ,403000
What is it with that guy...? 23A OMIT 23 INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - DAY Sebastian enters his apartment -- cramped, dingy, bare walls, no furniture or decoration, boxes filled with dusty black-and-white photographs and unused instruments on the floor, a black Steinway upright piano in the center of the living room -- and sees a WOMAN rummaging around. ,86
She looks up. ,2310000
She's 37 quickly going on 50, and dressed like she doesn't care. ,1190000
LAURA You think Mom or Dad would call this a home? ,2280000
Seeing that she's seated on a stained, decrepit stool -- SEBASTIAN Please don't sit on that. ,10100
LAURA Are you serious? ,14700000
SEBASTIAN Yes. ,8460
Hoagy Carmichael sat on that stool. ,7240
The Baked Potato was gonna throw it away. ,2940000
LAURA I wonder why. (then, rising,) I brought you this. ,249000
It's a throw rug. ,2480000
SEBASTIAN Don't need it. ,397000
LAURA Yeah? ,7110
What if I told you Miles Davis pissed on it? ,268000
Revision 11. ,195000
She shakes her head: Unbelievable. ,1180000
Tosses the rug to the side. ,3080000
LAURA When are you going to unpack these boxes? ,17100
SEBASTIAN When I unpack them in my club. ,5580000
It's like a girl broke up with you and you're stalking her. (then, looks at him --) You're not still going by there, are you? ,1620000
SEBASTIAN No. A beat. ,32800000
Then -- SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) They've turned it into a tapas-samba place. ,5930
You believe that? ,3300000
LAURA Seb -- SEBASTIAN Who wants to tapas while they samba? ,80400
LAURA I have someone I want you to meet. ,154000000
SEBASTIAN I don't want to meet anyone. ,19400000
LAURA You'll like her. ,17100000
SEBASTIAN Uh-huh. ,1040000
Does she like jazz? ,39700000
LAURA Probably not. ,78500000
SEBASTIAN Then what are we gonna talk about? ,3110000
LAURA You'll talk about the weather. ,823000
SEBASTIAN Ok. Then I have someone I'd like you to meet. ,2010000
He's got a face tattoo, but a heart of gold. ,1800000
Revision 12. ,175000
LAURA Sebastian -- SEBASTIAN How long's it been? ,198000
LAURA You need to get serious. ,754000
You're driving without insurance. ,451000
SEBASTIAN I am serious. ,1600000
It's not my fault I got Shanghai'ed. ,1950000
SEBASTIAN What's the difference? ,106000000
LAURA It's not as romantic as that. (she starts to walk off) And everyone knew that guy was shady except for you. ,25400
SEBASTIAN Why do you say romantic like it's a dirty word? ,2070000
Call her. ,1880000
She heads to the door. ,613000
He follows her, won't give it up -- SEBASTIAN You're acting like life's got me on the ropes -- what you don't understand is, I want to be on the ropes. ,1220
I'm letting life hit me `til it gets tired. ,4610000
Then I'm gonna make my move. ,3380000
It's a classic rope-a-dope. ,224000
Laura can't help but laugh. ,948000
Looks at him. ,1400000
Unpack your boxes. ,79600000
SEBASTIAN I'm changing the locks. ,60000
Revision 13. ,278000
LAURA (out the door with a smile --) You can't afford it. ,226000
She's gone. ,2470000
Sebastian thinks for a beat, then calls out -- SEBASTIAN I'm a phoenix rising from the ashes! No reply to his triumphant declaration. ,37500
He shuts the door. ,1290000
Looks again at the napkin. ,2970000
Tosses it in the trash. ,4830000
A23 INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - LATER Moments later. ,7190
Sebastian takes a slice of pizza from the fridge, pours himself some more coffee, places a Thelonious Monk LP onto a record player, and sits down at the piano. "Japanese Folk Song" -- the piece we heard in his car -- plays... ,99
Sebastian plays along. ,2130000
Stops. ,14800000
Moves the record back a few bars. ,202000
Plays the same passage over. ,4720000
Plays the passage again. ,2130000
Over and over, just like in his car -- until, finally, he gets it right. ,1860000
He keeps playing, louder now, and we're -- B23 OMIT 24 OMIT 25 OMIT 26 OMIT 27 INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT A red-booth bar-and-restaurant. ,2910
Christmas decorations all over. ,2590000
Sebastian steps in. ,10200000
Immediately beelining over -- BOSS Seb. ,17
SEBASTIAN (putting on a smile) Bill. ,79800
BOSS Your welcome. ,45800000
Stick to the set list. ,1680000
Revision 14. ,116000
SEBASTIAN Of course. (under his breath as he heads to the piano) Though I don't think they care what I play. ,229000
BOSS I do, and I don't want to hear the free jazz. ,4710000
SEBASTIAN How `bout one for you, one for me? ,163000000
Ok, that works. ,19300000
Good deal. ,8900000
Sebastian sits down at the keys. ,59900
A WAITRESS passes by. ,283000
WAITRESS Well... ,7810
SEBASTIAN There's a nice way to say that. ,6230000
With that -- he starts playing "Jingle Bells". 28 INT. RESTAURANT - LATER The restaurant's demographic has changed. ,1220
It's now younger stragglers wandering in. ,25000
He finishes "We Wish You a Merry Christmas". ,1470000
Zero applause. ,1610
He begins a new chart: "Deck the Halls". ,1030000
But something seems to come over him now. ,1940000
He's restless. ,6610000
Slowly, his playing drifts off -- his fingers charting their own path... ,11700
The one Mia heard outside. ,708000
The one we'll refer to from now on as Mia and Sebastian's song... ,171000
The door opens -- and Mia steps in. ,615000
Is instantly struck by his playing. [MIA AND SEBASTIAN'S THEME] Gradually -- all sounds but the music drop out. ,4740
Even the walls seem to go slightly darker -- as though Sebastian and Mia were all alone... ,161000
Sebastian finishes. ,1730
Silence. ,15300000
Mia looks like the wind has been knocked out of her. ,171000
Sebastian looks up for a second -- and sees her. ,2100000
They look at one another. ,8010
Just a moment. ,9750000
WE STAY ON Mia as she watches Sebastian rise with the Boss. ,217000
We just see the Boss talking to Sebastian, can't hear what is said. ,1400000
Then, we get closer -- and realize: BOSS ...every goddamned night. ,68600
Sebastian is silent. ,8180000
Then, doesn't want to have to beg but -- SEBASTIAN I'll stick to the set list, I promise -- BOSS Too late. ,240000
You're done. ,2600000
SEBASTIAN You're not gonna find a better player. ,7890000
You know that. ,146000000
BOSS (leans in, and --) Do you think anyone here gives a shit? ,17800
We linger on Sebastian. ,7870000
Anger giving way -- to hurt. ,2580000
BACK TO Mia -- who didn't hear what was said. ,12000000
Slams it shut. ,5800000
Mia is left standing on her own. ,10300000
She looks like she's just been slapped. ,1990000
SPRING 29 OMIT 30 INT. AUDITION ROOMS - DAY Mia auditions. ,492000
Pilot season cattle-call -- a series of soul- crushing try-outs. ,307000
She's pandering to the hilt. ,8130
Quick glimpses: MIA (CONT'D) I don't like the fissure on the GT scan. ,63
Damn Miranda Rights. 32 And finally, a third audition -- MIA (CONT'D) This is my classroom. ,245000
You don't like it, the door's to my left. ,83100000
READER (O.S.) (a well-dressed forty-year-old WOMAN reading from sides) Lady why you be trippin' like that? ,2460
MIA No, Jamal. ,311000
A BAD 80's COVER BAND plays. ,3350000
TRACY There you are! You need to meet someone! Carlo, this is Mia. ,1080000
CARLO TRACY Nice to meet you, Mia. ,142000
He's got projects all over town. ,81600000
CARLO (shrugs, faux-modest) They say I have a knack for world-building. ,38900
MIA (takes this in; then --) Congratulations. ,6090000
She slips away. ,585000
The music gets louder, more obnoxious. ,813000
She peers toward the band to get a look... ,2220000
And then she sees him. ,3860000
Sebastian. ,16300000
Playing keyboard-guitar for the band. ,2560000
Dressed up like his band- mates in a bright polyester outfit. ,460000
And hating every second. ,4990000
SINGER Alright, one more for y'all before we break. ,1790000
MIA "I Ran". ,116000
Sebastian turns. ,3460
Sees Mia, looking at him with a defiant grin, enjoying her power. ,97200
SINGER "I Ran" it is. (to Sebastian) Wanna start us off, piano-man? ,13000000
Sebastian stays silent. ,503000
Mortified. ,675000
Finally, so reluctant, he taps his keyboard to count the band in and begins playing. ,28900
On the keys, it's a single note, repeated measure after measure. ,124000
Mia knew this. ,8720000
Sebastian hurries from the keys -- enters the house, looks both ways, finally spots Mia and -- SEBASTIAN Ok. I remember you. ,25500
Mia looks at him. ,5260000
One eyebrow raised. ,7900000
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) And I'm sorry if I was curt that night. ,273000
MIA "Curt"? ,292000
SEBASTIAN Ok I was an asshole. ,1250000
I can admit that. ,8010000
MIA Ok. SEBASTIAN But requesting "I Ran" from a serious musician -- it's too far. ,173000
MIA My God. ,1070000
Did you just call yourself "a serious musician"? ,1080000
SEBASTIAN (beat) I don't think so. ,51000
MIA Can I borrow what you're wearing? ,21000000
SEBASTIAN Why? ,6520
MIA Because I have an audition next week. ,125000
I'm playing a serious fire-fighter. ,178000
SEBASTIAN (irritation building --) So you're an actress. ,420000
That makes sense. ,1190000
Have I seen you in anything? ,33300000
MIA Uh... ,4270
The coffee shop on the Warner Brothers lot. ,408000
That's a classic. ,25700000
SEBASTIAN Oh, you're a barista. ,370000
Well now I see how you can look down on me from all the way up there. ,74200000
SINGER (popping in from nowhere) Sebastian. ,41200
Second set. ,814000
Sebastian looks at Mia. ,1760000
Pleased. ,14400000
The Singer walks off. ,10200000
SEBASTIAN He doesn't tell me what to do. ,71800000
MIA He just told you what to do. ,72100000
Revision 19. ,89500
A beat. ,9660000
LA LA LAND Written by Damien Chazelle FADE IN... ,990000
A sun-blasted sky. ,3830000
We HEAR radios -- one piece of music after another... ,4260000
It's a horrific traffic jam. ,1280000
Morning rush hour. ,4720000
Sun beating down, asphalt shimmering in the heat. ,790000
The blown-out downtown L.A. skyline hovers in the distance. ,43600
We DRIFT past more CARS. Hear one snippet of audio after another... ,102000
One driver taps his steering wheel to PROG ROCK. Another sings to OPERA. A third raps along to a HIP-HOP track. ,5310
Then -- she starts MOVING down the lane. ,8530000
One by one, more DRIVERS join her -- SINGING and DANCING along. ,305000
Without a single cut, we've found ourselves in a FULL- FLEDGED MUSICAL NUMBER... ,232000
Drivers leap on car-tops, dance Jerome Robbins-style, making use of the road and the hot gleam of the automobiles. ,375
Finally -- all the drivers swing back into their vehicles -- and the song comes to a dramatic stop. ,230000
Flash title card: WINTER A1 We settle on a new car. ,762000
A 1983 Dodge Riviera. ,2600000
In it is SEBASTIAN, 32, L.A. native. ,61700000
He's listening to the radio. ,2070000
He's playing a track on his music system -- a tape of Thelonious Monk's "Japanese Folk Song". ,2530000
Revision 2. ,712000
B1 OMIT C1 We DRIFT from his car to one further up ahead. ,80200
A light-green 2005 Prius. ,2010000
Inside is MIA, 27, Nevada-raised. ,72600
Six years of "no" in L.A. have toughened her, but she's still a dreamer. ,7880000
She seems to be on the phone, speaking into her car's system. ,3920000
Fast, fiery, full of energy -- MIA ...and I swear to God, she was wrecked. ,37500
It was pure insanity. ,652000
Mia stops. ,1790
Mutters to herself: "Insanity"... ,52500
Then leans down and grabs a piece of paper from the passenger seat. ,472000
It's a SCRIPT. MIA (CONT'D) (reading now) Pure lunacy. ,6370
Oh God, I know... ,3550000
Just then -- the traffic around Mia starts to let up. ,65500
She's too focused on her lines to notice. ,11600000
Then -- a long, sustained honk behind her: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHT. Mia comes to. ,9140
Jerked back to reality. ,36300
It's Sebastian. ,159000
Mia gives him the finger. ,373000
We then FOLLOW her as she drives... 2 OMIT 3 OMIT 4 INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY Mia works, photos of Hollywood icons on the wall behind her, as -- CUSTOMER #1 This doesn't taste like almond milk. ,4450
MIA Don't worry, it is. ,1310000
Mia hands it over. ,43400
The Customer looks. ,673000
CUSTOMER #1 (CONT'D) I'll have a black coffee. ,27100000
Mia gets the coffee. ,325000
Quickly sneaks a look at a script hidden underneath her counter. ,84200
The same one we saw in her car... ,6440000
Revision 3. ,571000
She hands the coffee to the Customer. ,395000
We follow the Customer out through the door -- as a WOMAN walks into the shop. ,2810000
We don't see the Woman's face, but we see all the eyes in the shop turn immediately to her. ,2430000
WOMAN Cappuccino, please. ,6780000
Gets it made. ,71
The Manager takes it from her. ,47200000
MANAGER On us. ,16300000
WOMAN No, I insist. ,2710000
Then smiles at Mia and drops a bill in the tip jar. ,280000
Mia watches as the Woman walks off, is joined by a STUDIO EMPLOYEE on a golf cart outside -- we realize this coffee shop is on a STUDIO LOT -- and is driven away... ,22200
Then -- Mia's phone rings. ,1290000
It reads: "MOM". Mia presses "IGNORE" and the time pops up on the phone's screen: 4:07. ,65900
MIA Shit. ,1380
Removing her apron and hurrying out, turning back as -- MANAGER Where do you think you're going? ,10600
MIA It's -- five past... ,14300000
MANAGER You'd better be here early tomorrow. ,36400000
MIA Ok. -- then realizes she doesn't have her script, runs back to grab it, hurries on and then -- CRASHES into a table. ,2900
Coffee and food spill all over her shirt, and all at once we're -- 5 INT. AUDITION ROOM - DAY Mia's in a thick winter coat, covering her stained shirt. ,42000
On her cell, loudly laughing while her adrenaline surges -- MIA (CONT'D) And I swear to God, she was wrecked. ,13600
It was pure lunacy. ,45
Oh God, I know... ,3550000
Revision 4. ,405000
Her nerves are practically visible. ,148000
As she talks, we PULL BACK -- to see that she's auditioning for a CASTING DIRECTOR. MIA (CONT'D) No, no, Turner's fine. ,36700
So you -- are you waiting `til Denver to tell her...? (as her smile contracts) Oh. I see... (silence; she clenches her jaw...) No, you're right. ,89
I understand. (...and a tear falls from her eye) Ok... ,2140000
Oh... ,25000000
Can I come in? ,166000000
MIA (CONT'D) (crying now) No, I'm happy for you... ,2090000
The Casting Director waves the Assistant in. ,3090000
Mia stands there, trying to hold onto the tears, hold onto the emotion, as the Casting Director reads the post-it and thinks. ,44700
CASTING DIRECTOR (CONT'D) ...I'll call her back. ,1080000
Tell her I'm almost done in here. ,169000
The Assistant nods. ,1580000
Walks out. ,1520000
Mia waits, trying to maintain... ,195000
CASTING DIRECTOR (CONT'D) You know what? ,95700000
I think we're good. ,82400000
Thanks for coming in. ,749000
Mia looks at her. ,41100
A beat. 6 INT. LOBBY - DAY Mia exits. ,246000
Passes one beautiful redhead after the next -- all getting ready to cry. ,1060000
Enters the elevator with two other WOMEN -- tall, statuesque. ,84200
Also redheads. 7 INT. MIA'S APARTMENT - EARLY EVENING Mia enters. ,20100
Exhausted. ,7020000
Old movie posters hang on the walls, including a big Ingrid Bergman one over the bed. ,13800
Various other trinkets: an old globe, an old blue-and-red suitcase. ,284000
Mia takes off her shoe. ,32500
A blister on her sole. 8 WE CUT TO: Mia in the BATHROOM. Just showered, wrapped in a towel. ,26200
She turns off the vent. ,9380000
Dims the lights. ,430000
With the fog in place, her reflection looks like one of those soft-focus old Hollywood close-ups. ,38000
She hums as she brushes her hair... ,29500
Then -- the door SWINGS open -- and the spell is broken. ,102000
TRACY Holy Mother of God. ,1190000
Mia snaps out of it. ,6150000
TRACY (CONT'D) Ever heard of a vent? ,12600
ALEXIS (appearing in the hall, 26, eating Cheetos) Mia! How'd it go? ,113000
MIA Eh... ,6980
ALEXIS Same here. ,9260000
Or Rachel? ,95700
MIA I don't know who Jen and Rachel are. ,480000
ALEXIS They're the worst. ,649000
MIA I don't know if they were there. ,87100000
Revision 6. ,266000
CAITLIN (appearing, 27) Why is there a convention in the bathroom? ,11600000
TRACY Two minutes, people! Mia you're coming, right? ,316000
WE PAN TO find Mia poking her head out of her bedroom -- MIA Can't. ,65900
Working. ,21900000
TRACY (O.S.) What? (we PAN BACK to Tracy) Did she say "working"? ,3640000
She closes the door. ,2860000
Takes a moment. ,9500000
B8 WE CUT to the HALLWAY, to find Tracy POUNDING on Mia's door. ,193000
MIA (opening up) Yes? ,6000000
There are four things in my inbox that you're perfect for and I will submit you. ,15600000
But right now -- you're coming. ,146000
C8 With that -- she barges in and beelines to Mia's closet -- TRACY (CONT'D) It'll be fun. ,10800
MIA It'll be a bunch of social climbers packed into one of those glass houses. ,8170
TRACY Exactly. ,1210
She pulls out a blue dress. ,29500000
As Alexis hurries in -- TRACY (CONT'D) MIA This looks familiar. ,2900
I was going to give it back! Alexis moves from Mia's perfume to the dress, lighting up as she grabs it -- Revision 7. ,9790
ALEXIS Come on, Mia. ,1000000
TRACY (faux-offended) Lex! I'm disappointed in you. ,18600
There's nothing to make fun of. ,46600000
This party will be humanity at its finest. ,175000
Mia rolls her eyes -- and, with that -- Tracy BREAKS INTO SONG. [SOMEONE IN THE CROWD] She play-acts the clichés this party will represent. ,44600
Alexis and Caitlin join in, giddy and playful. ,16900
The roommates sing and dance, hoping to persuade Mia to join the night's revelry... ,178000
Mia remains reluctant. ,692000
Stays behind in her room as her roommates head out the door. ,260000
But she's starting to wonder: A night at home, feeling sorry for herself -- or a night out with her friends...? 9 EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING / STREET - NIGHT We're outside now, and BACK with Tracy, Alexis and Caitlin, marching across the courtyard and toward the street. ,13800
They sing, dance, half-assuming Mia is a no-go -- -- until Mia APPEARS, blue-dress-clad. ,31900
The energy swells and the four characters dance their way together down the street. ,3200000
Soon enough, we're at... 12 EXT. MODERN HILLTOP HOUSE - NIGHT Valet cars lined up. ,8250
Mia tries talking to a pair of WOMEN -- who promptly ditch her. ,36700
Seeing she's now alone, a YOUNG MAN swoops in to hit on her. ,2360000
She nears the BATHROOM door -- but a COUPLE stands in her way, making out. ,4930000
She slips in behind them... ,2510000
A13 Inside the BATHROOM, Mia takes a moment. ,1290000
The joy of seconds ago is gone from her eyes now. ,45000
She gazes into the mirror -- -- and SINGS by herself. ,164000
This verse, sung in private, belongs to a new style: less brash, and far more vulnerable... ,10900
Once finished, Mia takes a breath, steels herself to once again face the world, opens the door -- and rejoins the crowd... ,4360
Gradually we RAMP UP. Follow Mia OUTSIDE, where we see the splash of blue-green that is the POOL -- and a flurry of FAKE SNOW falling from above... ,745
As we reach FULL-SPEED, a PARTY-GOER races to the edge, jumps -- -- and we PLUNGE WITH HIM INTO THE POOL. This is the climax of the number. ,6590
Everyone joins in, circling the pool -- a swath of color against the black sky. ,2220
Everyone dances, everyone sings -- and the song concludes with a blast of fireworks. ,62800
C13 OMIT A14 EXT. STREET - NIGHT Close on a sign: "NO PARKING ANYTIME: TOW-AWAY ZONE". Revision 9. ,63
MIA (O.S.) No... ,684000000
We see Mia -- all alone, staring at the sign. ,132000
No car in sight. ,132000000
It's dead. ,25600000
MIA (CONT'D) No... 15 OMIT 16 OMIT 17 OMIT A17 OMIT B17 OMIT 18 OMIT 19 EXT. HILL / LOS ANGELES STREETS - NIGHT Mia trudges down the steep hill in her unwieldy heels. ,19
She's an hour-and-a-half walk from her place. ,9230000
She crosses roads and lots, navigates stretches where the sidewalk stops and gives way to shrubbery. ,5950
A19 And then -- she hears something... ,2290000
Music. ,37000000
And a MELODY -- one we will come to know very well... ,55000000
Without being sure why, she FOLLOWS THE SOUND. Passes several doors. ,1310000
Then stops. ,766000
Has found where it's coming from... ,6990000
She reaches out -- and slowly opens a door... ,2650000
This time we're on Sebastian -- the honker. ,1160000
She gives him the finger. ,31100
He drives on, shaking his head... 21 OMIT 22 EXT. RAYO'S - MOMENTS LATER Sebastian sips a coffee as he gazes across the street -- at a 30's Deco building. ,12200
The door opens. ,11300000
Two EMPLOYEES step out, setting up a valet stand. ,207000
Recognize him. ,402000
What is it with that guy...? 23A OMIT 23 INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - DAY Sebastian enters his apartment -- cramped, dingy, bare walls, no furniture or decoration, boxes filled with dusty black-and-white photographs and unused instruments on the floor, a black Steinway upright piano in the center of the living room -- and sees a WOMAN rummaging around. ,88
She looks up. ,2750000
She's 37 quickly going on 50, and dressed like she doesn't care. ,782000
This is LAURA, Sebastian's older sister. ,310000
Seeing that she's seated on a stained, decrepit stool -- SEBASTIAN Please don't sit on that. ,14300
LAURA Are you serious? ,12000000
SEBASTIAN Yes. ,8660
Hoagy Carmichael sat on that stool. ,9820
The Baked Potato was gonna throw it away. ,5670000
LAURA I wonder why. (then, rising,) I brought you this. ,251000
LAURA Yeah? ,6680
What if I told you Miles Davis pissed on it? ,269000
SEBASTIAN That's almost insulting... (then,) Did he? ,1450000
Revision 11. ,192000
She shakes her head: Unbelievable. ,1160000
Tosses the rug to the side. ,2910000
SEBASTIAN When I unpack them in my club. ,6580000
LAURA Oh my God. ,468000
It's like a girl broke up with you and you're stalking her. (then, looks at him --) You're not still going by there, are you? ,1800000
You believe that? ,3290000
LAURA Seb -- SEBASTIAN Who wants to tapas while they samba? ,87100
LAURA I have someone I want you to meet. ,153000000
Does she like jazz? ,39800000
SEBASTIAN Then what are we gonna talk about? ,3100000
LAURA You'll talk about the weather. ,737000
SEBASTIAN Ok. Then I have someone I'd like you to meet. ,6550000
He's got a face tattoo, but a heart of gold. ,1390000
Revision 12. ,176000
LAURA Sebastian -- SEBASTIAN How long's it been? ,248000
LAURA You need to get serious. ,753000
You're driving without insurance. ,533000
SEBASTIAN I am serious. ,1100000
I had a very serious plan for my future. ,52400000
It's not my fault I got Shanghai'ed. ,1830000
LAURA You did not get "Shanghai'ed", you got ripped off. ,600000
LAURA It's not as romantic as that. (she starts to walk off) And everyone knew that guy was shady except for you. ,25100
LAURA Unpaid bills are not romantic. ,157000
Call her. ,1910000
She heads to the door. ,724000
He follows her, won't give it up -- SEBASTIAN You're acting like life's got me on the ropes -- what you don't understand is, I want to be on the ropes. ,1180
I'm letting life hit me `til it gets tired. ,3900000
It's a classic rope-a-dope. ,105000
Laura can't help but laugh. ,1050000
LAURA I love you. ,204000000
SEBASTIAN I'm changing the locks. ,55300
Revision 13. ,264000
LAURA (out the door with a smile --) You can't afford it. ,217000
Sebastian thinks for a beat, then calls out -- SEBASTIAN I'm a phoenix rising from the ashes! No reply to his triumphant declaration. ,36900
Looks again at the napkin. ,2980000
Tosses it in the trash. ,4340000
A23 INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - LATER Moments later. ,6980
Sebastian takes a slice of pizza from the fridge, pours himself some more coffee, places a Thelonious Monk LP onto a record player, and sits down at the piano. "Japanese Folk Song" -- the piece we heard in his car -- plays... ,98
Sebastian plays along. ,2220000
Moves the record back a few bars. ,192000
Starts it again. ,428000
Stops. ,14700000
Over and over, just like in his car -- until, finally, he gets it right. ,1270000
He keeps playing, louder now, and we're -- B23 OMIT 24 OMIT 25 OMIT 26 OMIT 27 INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT A red-booth bar-and-restaurant. ,3180
Sebastian steps in. ,10100000
Thanks for having me back. ,286000
Stick to the set list. ,1760000
SEBASTIAN Of course. (under his breath as he heads to the piano) Though I don't think they care what I play. ,228000
BOSS I do, and I don't want to hear the free jazz. ,4280000
SEBASTIAN How `bout one for you, one for me? ,164000000
Or two for you, one for me? (the Boss just glares) Or all for you, none for me? ,2270000
Ok, that works. ,19600000
Good deal. ,8750000
Sebastian sits down at the keys. ,59700
WAITRESS Well... ,7170
Welcome back. ,14400000
SEBASTIAN There's a nice way to say that. ,6310000
It's now younger stragglers wandering in. ,24800
Sebastian looks beyond bored. ,720000
He finishes "We Wish You a Merry Christmas". ,1460000
Zero applause. ,1450
He begins a new chart: "Deck the Halls". ,964000
But something seems to come over him now. ,4810000
He's restless. ,6740000
Slowly, his playing drifts off -- his fingers charting their own path... ,18300
And then -- we hear a melody. ,1560000
The one Mia heard outside. ,743000
The one we'll refer to from now on as Mia and Sebastian's song... ,180000
The door opens -- and Mia steps in. ,617000
She sees Sebastian at the piano. ,23800
Even the walls seem to go slightly darker -- as though Sebastian and Mia were all alone... ,156000
He concludes his piece with a jumble of chords, his playing almost free jazz now, as we pull back to real life... ...and see the Boss looking on in scorn. ,1170
Sebastian finishes. ,1800
Mia looks like the wind has been knocked out of her. ,181000
They look at one another. ,8040
Just a moment. ,13500000
Then -- the Boss taps Sebastian on the shoulder. ,48200
WE STAY ON Mia as she watches Sebastian rise with the Boss. ,242000
We just see the Boss talking to Sebastian, can't hear what is said. ,1560000
Sebastian is silent. ,8280000
Then, doesn't want to have to beg but -- SEBASTIAN I'll stick to the set list, I promise -- BOSS Too late. ,238000
You're done. ,2650000
SEBASTIAN You're not gonna find a better player. ,8190000
You know that. ,153000000
With that, the Boss walks off. ,5600000
We linger on Sebastian. ,4670000
Anger giving way -- to hurt. ,2060000
He starts hurrying toward the door. ,3530000
She watches Sebastian -- takes a breath, so moved that she's about to lay it all out -- swoops in to corner him -- and -- MIA I just wanted to say -- I saw your playing, and I -- -- but Sebastian just walks right by -- his shoulder bumping against Mia's for an added measure of disdain. ,481
He heads out the door. ,40600000
Slams it shut. ,5770000
She looks like she's just been slapped. ,2010000
SMASH CUT TO BLACK. Revision 16. ,45600
SPRING 29 OMIT 30 INT. AUDITION ROOMS - DAY Mia auditions. ,497000
Pilot season cattle-call -- a series of soul- crushing try-outs. ,306000
She's pandering to the hilt. ,8180
Quick glimpses: MIA (CONT'D) I don't like the fissure on the GT scan. ,62
Damn Miranda Rights. 32 And finally, a third audition -- MIA (CONT'D) This is my classroom. ,199000
You don't like it, the door's to my left. ,95200000
READER (O.S.) (a well-dressed forty-year-old WOMAN reading from sides) Lady why you be trippin' like that? ,2470
TRACY There you are! You need to meet someone! Carlo, this is Mia. ,1280000
Mia, Carlo's a writer. ,1550000
CARLO TRACY Nice to meet you, Mia. ,178000
He's got projects all over town. ,81800000
CARLO (shrugs, faux-modest) They say I have a knack for world-building. ,33000
I have to grab a drink... ,37000000
Revision 17. ,136000
She slips away. ,635000
Presses toward the bar. ,51200
The music gets louder, more obnoxious. ,798000
And then she sees him. ,3830000
Sebastian. ,16000000
Dressed up like his band- mates in a bright polyester outfit. ,476000
And hating every second. ,2840000
SINGER Alright, one more for y'all before we break. ,2630000
Sebastian turns. ,3390
Sees Mia, looking at him with a defiant grin, enjoying her power. ,89900
SINGER "I Ran" it is. (to Sebastian) Wanna start us off, piano-man? ,12000000
Sebastian stays silent. ,514000
Finally, so reluctant, he taps his keyboard to count the band in and begins playing. ,25100
On the keys, it's a single note, repeated measure after measure. ,109000
Mia knew this. ,8880000
Sebastian looks at her. ,3750000
SINGER (CONT'D) I walked along the avenue... 35 EXT. PARTY / INT. HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER Set break. ,730
Sebastian hurries from the keys -- enters the house, looks both ways, finally spots Mia and -- SEBASTIAN Ok. I remember you. ,18500
Mia looks at him. ,8490000
One eyebrow raised. ,10000000
Yeah? ,17400000
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) And I'm sorry if I was curt that night. ,275000
MIA "Curt"? ,282000
I can admit that. ,10800000
Revision 18. ,96400
MIA Ok. SEBASTIAN But requesting "I Ran" from a serious musician -- it's too far. ,183000
MIA My God. ,1040000
Did you just call yourself "a serious musician"? ,1430000
SEBASTIAN (beat) I don't think so. ,52500
MIA Can I borrow what you're wearing? ,21100000
SEBASTIAN Why? ,6950
MIA Because I have an audition next week. ,134000
I'm playing a serious fire-fighter. ,205000
SEBASTIAN (irritation building --) So you're an actress. ,417000
That makes sense. ,1460000
Have I seen you in anything? ,31300000
MIA Uh... ,4250
SEBASTIAN Oh, you're a barista. ,355000
Well now I see how you can look down on me from all the way up there. ,57800000
SINGER (popping in from nowhere) Sebastian. ,49900
Second set. ,825000
Sebastian looks at Mia. ,1890000
She smirks. ,16500
The Singer walks off. ,13600000
SEBASTIAN He doesn't tell me what to do. ,74300000
MIA He just told you what to do. ,85300000
Revision 19. ,89800
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) What's your name? ,91800000
MIA Mia. ,512000
SEBASTIAN Mia. ,4600
Guess I'll see you in the movies. ,76500000
He heads back to the keys, and the band resumes: SINGER Never seen you lookin' so lovely as you did tonight... 36 EXT. PARTY / STREET - NIGHT The party's finished. ,73800
She's stuck once again with CARLO, who's regaling her -- CARLO ...Goldilocks from the point of view of the bears. ,40700
Home-invasion thriller. ,2190000
Fox and Warners are going crazy for it. ,29000
Mia spots Sebastian, passing by the Valet with his keys. ,34200
CARLO (CONT'D) ...We're going after Charlize. ,36000
For the bear. ,9710000
We're flipping it. ,1260000
Feels like a franchise. ,6040000
But the thing is it's grounded. ,80100000
MIA (to Sebastian) George Michael! Sebastian stops. ,90900
Looks at her. ,3500000
Surprised. ,12400000
SEBASTIAN You again. ,191000
MIA Did you just get your keys? ,42800000
Sebastian thinks. ,11600
Sees the Valet. ,10200000
Playing it off -- SEBASTIAN ...Yeah. ,1880000
Revision 20. ,217000
MIA The Prius. ,225000
A beat. ,9610000
Sebastian turns to the Valet's box. ,360000
Motions to the Valet: Sorry. ,4860000
One second. ,1820000
All the keys are Prius keys. ,338000
MIA (CONT'D) The one with the green ribbon. ,232000
Another beat. ,93900
Sebastian finds it. ,8600000
Grabs it. 37 EXT. STREET - NIGHT Mia and Sebastian trudge up a hill lined with cars. ,6470
Mia aims her key fob. ,454000
No beep. ,152000
Sebastian points his own keys, also aiming for a beep. ,124000
They've been at this for a while. ,119000
MIA (CONT'D) (almost tripping in her heels) Shit... ,12500
SEBASTIAN Those look comfortable. ,2670000
MIA They are...n't. ,14300
She aims again. ,98
No beep. ,145000
MIA (CONT'D) Thank you for saving the day back there. ,124000
MIA Strange that we keep running into each other. ,447000
SEBASTIAN It is strange. ,4270000
MIA I doubt it. ,3410000
SEBASTIAN Yeah I don't think so either. ,6310000
On that, Mia aims again. ,531000
As always -- no beep. ,2630000
Noticing -- SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Put the clicker under your chin. ,69800
MIA What? ,54300
Sebastian demonstrates with his fob. ,162000
He looks idiotic. ,6320000
SEBASTIAN It turns your head into an antenna. ,17500000
Probably gives you cancer, but you find your car more quickly. ,6320000
MIA Uh-huh. ,178000
SEBASTIAN You don't live as long, but you get things done faster, so it all evens out. ,101000
MIA Oh my God. ,417000
Just then, they reach a clearing -- AND THE CITY SKYLINE APPEARS BELOW. A ribbon of lights, stretching as far as you can see. ,23300
It's the most romantic sight imaginable. ,24900
They look at each other. ,376000
And then -- MIA (CONT'D) Eh. They walk on, the lights shimmering behind. ,11700
SEBASTIAN Not much to look at. ,14100000
MIA Agreed. ,2500
I've seen better. ,1940000
It's "no big deal", nothing they haven't seen or felt before -- because, after all, there's no chance for romance between them... ,15500000
Of course, the music, swelling and building, suggests otherwise. ,24100000
Mia tires of her heels, finds a bench and fishes for flats in her handbag. ,34200
Sebastian sits beside her as she slips the flats on. ,19600
Revision 22. ,91200
He moves his foot. ,1380000
She moves hers. ,8440000
They look at each other again. ,16300000
Still suspicious... ,33900
He moves again. ,1200000
She moves again. ,1060000
They seem to be moving in sync -- without their even wanting to... ,3710000
And -- bit by bit -- before our eyes -- they've almost slipped into DANCE... ,134000
The two look at each other. ,9920000
Run back to the bench, hop atop it -- the lights stretch out like a magic carpet. ,177000
Mia does a move, Sebastian responds. ,220000
Sebastian does a move, Mia shakes her head: "Nope". ,139000
They make the road their own, growing more and more energized, as surprised as we are to find -- ...that they can really dance together. ,44200
Just as this starts to look like a blossoming romance, real joy peeking through, our two heroes getting closer and closer and closer, looking at each other almost giddily... ...a sound cuts through. ,60
It's a CELL PHONE ring. ,924000
Mia and Sebastian turn -- to her handbag, back by the bench. ,175000
Snapped out of it, Mia heads over and pulls out her cell. ,1660000
MIA (CONT'D) Hey... ,61300
Greg...? ,16200000
Can you hear me...? ,11000000
Yeah, I'm just leaving now... ,38700000
K, see you soon... ,5420000
Looks at Sebastian. ,4140
An awkward silence. ,11000000
Finally -- she presses her fob again. ,846000
Puts it under her chin this time. ,2420000
A BEEP can be heard. ,430000
They see her Prius. ,24800000
MIA (CONT'D) Ah. Great... ,87700
Well... ,22500000
Do you want a ride to your car? ,1800000
SEBASTIAN No, that's fine... ,26300000
MIA ...Ok... ,1400000
Not sure what else to say, she heads to her vehicle. ,606000
Waves. ,15200000
MIA (CONT'D) Night. ,142000
Sebastian waves back. ,653000
Fast. ,22500000
Silence... ,15500000
Looking even more disappointed than he thought he'd be, Sebastian walks on for a bit -- then retreats back down. ,8980
A37 Comes to a stop across from the party, and we see his Riviera -- right, it seems, where he knew it was all along. ,7270
He pulls out his keys -- they don't have a clicker after all. 38 OMIT 39 INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY CLOSE on -- CUSTOMER Are these pastries gluten-free? ,20700
A typically chaotic day. ,2140000
MIA No... ,15200000
CUSTOMER What?? ,372000
Mia nods, heads to the Manager -- MANAGER You're closing up Friday. ,53400
MIA I have an audition. ,5640000
Remember? ,21100000
Reschedule it. ,78600
MIA But you said -- MANAGER And fix your apron. ,212000
With that, the Manager walks off. ,Mia is silent for a moment -- wants to talk back but needs this job -- then turns -- and sees Sebastian at the counter. ,80800
MIA ...Hi. (then) What are you doing here? ,21500000
SEBASTIAN Meetings. ,71
Studio heads. ,89600
Revision 24. ,80300
MIA Uh-huh. ,178000
How'd you get on the lot? ,89400000
SEBASTIAN Piece of cake. ,164000
Mia looks at him. ,5430000
He's sweating through his shirt. ,435000
A beat. ,9620000
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Actually it took me four hours and I ended up running. ,79200
We probably have twenty minutes before the guy finds me. ,16800000
You got a break coming up? ,12300000
Mia laughs. ,1920
A moment. ,13200000
MIA I'm off in ten. ,303000
SEBASTIAN Great. ,9670
I'll hide in the bathroom. 40 EXT. COFFEE SHOP / STUDIO LOT - DAY Mia exits, apron off. ,38000
She and Sebastian start walking. ,4480000
She points across the street -- to the façade of a Parisian apartment. ,102000
MIA That's the window Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart looked out of in Casablanca. ,33000
Sebastian nods. ,318
They start walking. ,72500
SEBASTIAN What's your Bogart's name...? (Mia looks at him) Is it Greg? ,138000
MIA Yeah. ,4340
Greg. ,16000000
SEBASTIAN How long have...? ,336000000
MIA We've been seeing each other for a few months. ,1290000
An awkward beat. ,1750000
They pass a wooden SALOON -- where a WESTERN is being shot. ,2510000
Extras in COWBOY costumes drink coffee on the steps. ,456000
Revision 25. ,79500
MIA (CONT'D) I love this stuff. ,33600
Makes coming to work easier. ,72700000
SEBASTIAN I know what you mean. ,72900000
I get breakfast five miles out of the way just to sit outside a jazz club. ,130000
MIA Oh yeah? ,407000
SEBASTIAN It was called Van Beek. ,The swing bands played there. ,Count Basie. ,Chick Webb. (then,) It's a samba-tapas place now. ,MIA A what? ,SEBASTIAN Samba-tapas. ,It's... ,The joke's on history. ,Mia laughs. ,SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Anyway, that's L.A. ,They worship everything and they value nothing. ,They reach a patch of green. ,Another shoot. ,A P.A. yells out: P.A. ,Clear the frame! MIA (to Sebastian) We need to wait here. ,SEBASTIAN I know. ,They shoot movies on my street. "C-stands." "Apple box." "Don't forget to sign out." Mia laughs. ,A.D. (O.S.) Quiet on set! Mia and Sebastian watch the cameras roll. ,Then, in a whisper -- SEBASTIAN How'd you get into all this? ,Revision 26. ,MIA Into...? ,Oh -- I -- my aunt was an actress. ,She was in this traveling theater company... ,And there was this little library across the street from my house when I was growing up. ,This was Boulder City, Nevada -- every house looked exactly the same. ,I was ten and already I needed to get out. ,And one day, my aunt flew into town, and she showed me the library's old-movie section. ,We spent a whole day watching one after the other. ,Bringing Up Baby. ,Notorious. ,Casablanca. (a beat; then,) I never knew the world was so big. ,DIRECTOR (O.S.) Cut! Mia and Sebastian resume walking. ,Now, at full volume -- MIA I started putting on plays in my garage. ,I'd write the scripts and print up programs, and she'd give me props to use from wherever she'd just been -- New York, London, Paris. ,And then she'd jet off again and I wouldn't hear from her for another year. ,SEBASTIAN Who would you invite to watch? ,Your parents? ,MIA God no -- I didn't invite anyone. ,That would have been terrifying. ,C40 CUT TO: The entrance to a giant soundstage. ,MIA (CONT'D) Honestly, I wish I loved something else. ,I've tried so hard to want other things. ,She and Sebastian stop. ,Peer inside the stage. ,MIA (CONT'D) I left school after two years to come here, my fourth manager just dropped me, and my last audition was for a teen soap pitched as Dangerous Minds meets The O.C. (a beat; then, deadpan --) Should've been a lawyer. ,Revision 27. ,They resume walking. ,D40 CUT TO: A row of closed soundstages, sandy-tan against the bright blue sky. ,SEBASTIAN ...`Cause the world needs more lawyers. ,MIA Well it doesn't need more actresses. ,SEBASTIAN You're not just an actress. ,MIA What do you mean, "just an actress"? ,SEBASTIAN You said it yourself, you're a child- prodigy playwright. ,MIA That is not what I said. ,SEBASTIAN You're too modest to say it but it's true. ,So you could write your own roles. ,Write something that's as interesting as you are. ,MIA Last thing I wrote was a stand-up routine for an open-mic night. ,It was horrible. ,SEBASTIAN All I'm saying is -- Louis Armstrong could have played the marching-band charts he was given. ,What did he do instead? ,He made history. ,MIA Ok, I'll stop auditioning and make history instead. ,Sebastian laughs. ,MIA (CONT'D) Anyway -- I'm getting a feeling there's something I should tell you... ,SEBASTIAN Yeah? ,Revision 28. ,MIA I hate jazz. ,Turns to her. ,SEBASTIAN What does that mean? "I hate jazz"? ,MIA It means when I listen to it I don't like it. ,SEBASTIAN But it's such a blanket statement. ,It's like saying "I hate animals". ,MIA I do hate some animals. ,SEBASTIAN Do you need to be anywhere right now? ,We hear DRUMS. A swinging ride pattern. ,And we're in -- 41 INT. LIGHTHOUSE CAFE - DAY -- an old-school JAZZ CLUB. It's almost empty, only aged JAZZ CATS here -- except for Mia and Sebastian, watching a QUARTET... ,SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Most people say they hate jazz because they don't have context. ,They don't get where it came from. ,All these people packed into flophouses in New Orleans, speaking five different languages, and jazz was how they talked to each other. ,MIA I thought it was just Kenny G. ,SEBASTIAN ...What? ,Already knows just how to get to him. ,MIA I associate it with facials. ,It's relaxing. ,SEBASTIAN It's not relaxing! Sid Bechet got into a gunfight `cause somebody told him he played a wrong note! Revision 29. ,MIA (laying it on thick) Right, but it's good to talk over. ,Where I grew up there's this jazz station they'd play at cocktail parties whenever they served the salami and cheese. ,These are things you can't unsay. ,She bursts into laughter. ,Sebastian points to the band -- SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) It's not cocktail music -- it's a high- wire act. ,These guys are performing and composing and rearranging all at once. ,Mia looks at the band. ,We DRIFT over the instruments... ,SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) That's why you need to be in the space and see what's at stake. ,This whole thing -- it's dying. ,In twenty minutes they'll head off to cut commercial sessions or do pit at the Pantages `cause they have to -- but when I have my own place -- my club -- they'll play whatever they want. ,Mia looks at Sebastian. ,Her laughter has subsided. ,She can see something in him now -- the same passion he's speaking of... ,MIA Your club? ,SEBASTIAN ...It's gonna be the old Van Beek. ,I'm getting the lease back. ,It'll be perfect. ,He watches the band. ,Lost in the sound. ,Then -- sincere -- SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) The world tells everyone to move on. ,Says the music's had its moment. ,But I love it too much. ,I'm not moving on. ,The band finishes. ,The ride cymbal sizzles in the air... ,SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) So? He looks at Mia. ,She's visibly moved. ,Just then -- we hear a BEEP. Mia looks at her phone. ,Revision 30. 42 INT. SIDE CORRIDOR - LIGHTHOUSE CAFE - CONTINUOUS MIA Hi, I just missed a call... 43 INT. LIGHTHOUSE CAFE - MOMENTS LATER Mia steps out, dazed. ,Sebastian's listening to a new tune. ,He spots Mia, turns to her -- as, shouting over the music -- MIA (CONT'D) I got a call-back! SEBASTIAN Really? ,For what? ,MIA That show I told you about. ,SEBASTIAN Dangerous Minds meets The O.C.? MIA Right. ,It's -- actually more like Rebel Without a Cause. ,SEBASTIAN That's amazing! "I got the bulletsssss!" Mia laughs. ,But Sebastian can tell something in her laugh... ,SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) You've seen it, right? ,MIA Obviously. (a beat; then --) No. SEBASTIAN What? ,You're the movie person. ,MIA It's the one I lie about. ,SEBASTIAN Come on. ,You can't do this audition and never see Rebel. ,The theater near me's playing it. ,If you want -- I can take you. ,For research. ,MIA (considering this) ...Ok. Revision 31. ,SEBASTIAN 10pm Monday at the Rialto. ,Cool? ,MIA Ok. (another nod, taking it in) For research. ,Mia looks at him -- he looks at her -- each of them suppressing a newfound giddiness... ,And on that -- 44 EXT. LIGHTHOUSE CAFE - EVENING Mia and Sebastian exit. ,Wave "good-bye". ,We FOLLOW Sebastian. ,He rounds the corner, nears the Hermosa Beach pier... ...and begins to SING. [CITY OF STARS] Lifted by a strange new feeling -- a feeling he wasn't expecting. ,The feeling that perhaps -- just perhaps -- he's falling in love... ,He gazes out at the sea, the purple sky. ,Dances with an OLD COUPLE, then continues on his way, as though caught in a dream. ,There's an uncertainty in his singing -- he's not sure if this dream will sustain. ,But for now, it's a beautiful feeling... ,The MUSIC simmers down -- and WE FADE OUT. 45 EXT. AUDITION BUILDING - DAY A Pasadena building. ,As Mia approaches the door, another cell ring. ,It's her MOM. This time, Mia is happy to get the call: MIA (CONT'D) Hi, Mom! MIA'S MOM (O.S.) Hi, sweetie. ,How are you? ,MIA Great, actually: I got a call-back on a pilot. ,MIA'S MOM (O.S.) Oh my God! You're going to be on TV?? MIA Well -- it's not picked up yet. ,MIA'S MOM (O.S.) Not picked up? ,MIA First they make the pilot, then if they like the pilot it goes on TV. Revision 32. ,MIA'S MOM (O.S.) And you're in the pilot? ,MIA Well, no, I have a call-back. ,MIA'S MOM (O.S.) I see... ,Didn't you audition for a TV thing last week? ,MIA It's another audition. ,MIA'S MOM (O.S.) I see... ,So you might get a role in a thing that might one day be put on TV... ,MIA ...Well when you put it like that it sounds like a huge accomplishment. ,MIA'S MOM (O.S.) No, I don't mean that, it's so exciting. ,What channel? ,ABC? HBO? MIA Oxygen. ,MIA'S MOM (O.S.) Oxygen? ,MIA You know what, I have to go. ,Takes a deep breath. ,Enters the building. 46 INT. WAITING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER Mia sits, starts reviewing her script. ,Looks around her -- the room is filled with ACTRESSES silently MOUTHING THEIR LINES. It's a bizarre sight: a dozen women moving their mouths, with no sound coming out at all. ,What's more, they're all in variations of the same type of costume: Michelle Pfeiffer's leather jacket from Dangerous Minds. ,A few stare at Mia, sizing her up. ,In the corner, another one of them GRUNTS while performing stretches. ,Then -- a DOOR to the side opens, and Mia can hear -- DIRECTOR (O.S.) ...We'll be seeing you very soon. ,Revision 33. ,An ACTRESS exits. ,Absolutely beaming. ,And then, a bored voice -- ASSISTANT Mia Dolan? 47 INT. AUDITION ROOM - MOMENTS LATER Mia steps in. ,The pilot's DIRECTOR is seated at a table, looking in his folder at Mia's head-shot. ,He looks up at Mia. ,DIRECTOR Whenever you're ready. ,Mia breathes in. ,Heart pounding. ,Sweat percolating. ,Has been practicing this for days now. ,Fighting her nerves, she begins -- MIA Two options. ,Follow my rules, or follow my rules. ,Kapish? ,You want to bully, you'd best be ready to get bullied -- DIRECTOR Thanks. ,Mia is taken aback. ,MIA I can do it another way -- DIRECTOR No, thanks, that was great. ,We linger on Mia for a moment, and then -- 48 EXT. PARKING LOT / INT. MIA'S CAR - DAY Crestfallen, humiliated, Mia hurries to her car. ,Sees a voice- mail on her cell. ,Plays it -- MIA'S MOM (O.S.) Dad just helped me find Oxygen on the guide! So exciting! So will you be getting health insurance now? ,Mia switches her phone off and drives. ,Clenches her jaw. ,Turns left and sees a movie theater. ,The Rialto. ,Manages a smile. ,Something she can remain upbeat about... ,Revision 34. 49 INT. MIA'S APARTMENT - DAY Mia in her room, sorting through outfits. ,Slips into jeans -- ALEXIS Mia? -- then spins around, startled. ,Alexis is at the door, eating Fritos. ,Has been crying. ,ALEXIS (CONT'D) (with difficulty) Greg's here... ,Mia looks at Alexis -- completely confused. ,Then -- Greg steps out behind Alexis. ,Waves to her. ,GREG Hey... ,I'm parked out front. ,But we should hurry, my brother just landed. ,Mia looks at him, still confused. ,Then remembers. ,GREG (CONT'D) Did you forget? ,No. Yes. ,I'll change... ,GREG (smiles) It's ok. ,Mia closes her door -- turns -- and we see her face. ,She's crushed. ,She goes to call Sebastian -- then freezes. ,Remembers something else. ,She never got his number... ,We linger on her face, as, on his phone outside her door -- GREG (O.S.) (CONT'D) Josh! Yep, just picking Mia up now. ,Will be there in twenty. 50 INT. LIGHTHOUSE CAFE - NIGHT Sebastian's playing a jam session. ,Excited, distracted. 10pm can't come quickly enough. 51 INT. JAR - NIGHT Mia, in a green dress, with Greg, his brother JOSH, and Josh's FIANCEE. The restaurant is posh, modern. ,Josh wears a Brooks Brothers suit: he seems better-off than his brother. ,Revision 35. ,JOSH That's right -- but now we've got a surround-sound set-up, so it's like -- FIANCEE It's like being in a movie theater. ,JOSH It's better than going to a theater, really. ,You know theaters these days -- GREG Oh, sure -- JOSH -- they're so dirty, and they're either too hot or too cold, and there's always people talking, which is just -- (his phone buzzes) -- just so annoying, I mean you're trying to watch a movie -- one second -- (opens phone) Hello?... ,His Fiancée smiles, looks at Greg and Mia, proud. ,FIANCEE Probably work. ,JOSH Yeah, I'll have to call you back. (closes and pockets his phone) So, yeah, we love it. ,Awkward silence. ,Mia hasn't spoken a word. 52 EXT. RIALTO MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT Sebastian paces. ,People shuffle in. ,He looks. ,No sign of Mia. 53 INT. JAR - NIGHT Midway through the meal. ,Mia is bored, restless, uneasy. ,JOSH (CONT'D) One word for you. ,Nicaragua. ,GREG I've never heard anyone say that. ,Was it amazing? ,Revision 36. ,JOSH Oh my God. ,A five-star jungle eco-resort. ,It was unbelievable. ,Mia stays quiet, in her own thoughts, the voices around her fading away. ,And then she hears it -- coming from the restaurant speakers, peeking out subtly at first: the melody we now know so well... ,Her and Sebastian's song. ,She FREEZES. The radio music seems to have morphed into the melody, and the tune stirs something deep within her... ,A few seconds pass. ,And then she can't deny it any longer. ,It's clear as day to her now. ,She rises from her seat -- GREG Mia? -- looks at Greg -- MIA I'm sorry. -- and -- as the sounds of a FULL ORCHESTRA swoop in -- -- RUNS out of the restaurant as fast as she can. 54 EXT. JAR - NIGHT The MUSIC SWELLS, strings carrying us through and lifting Mia's spirits as she runs down the street in her green dress, for once absolutely sure of what she's doing... 55 INT. RIALTO MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT Inside the Rialto, Sebastian settling into his seat, the show about to begin. ,He's visibly disappointed that he's alone. ,The lights dim. ,Projector light cuts through the darkness. ,And then, as the movie's credits start up, Sebastian spots, out of the corner of his eye, a figure in the aisle... ,He looks. ,The figure turns. ,It's Mia. ,And, caught like a freeze-frame in the projector light, her green dress incandescent, the giant movie screen behind her like a great piece of back-projection, she looks more beautiful than ever right now. ,A true old-fashioned screen siren. ,Sebastian's eyes go wide. ,He's surprised. ,And thrilled. ,He waves. ,Mia hurries toward him. ,Takes the seat next to his, as Rebel Without a Cause begins... ,Revision 37. 56 INT. RIALTO MOVIE THEATER - LATER Half an hour has passed. ,The movie plays, lights flickering on Mia and Sebastian's darkened faces. ,He puts his arm on the armrest, she moves hers nervously. ,He scoots to his right, she scoots back. ,She edges her elbow onto the armrest, he moves his arm. ,Inch by inch, their bodies grow closer. ,Hands approaching, breaths quickening, hearts pounding... ...until finally their hands touch... ,And then, suddenly -- just as James Dean and Natalie Wood arrive at Griffith Observatory, and Mia and Sebastian seem about to kiss -- -- burn marks streak their way across the image. ,The screen goes blank. ,The lights go on. ,Mia and Sebastian turn around. ,AUDIENCE MEMBERS start murmuring. ,Sebastian can barely believe his bad luck. ,But then Mia turns to him. ,Energized. ,1900000
MIA (CONT'D) I have an idea. 57 EXT. ROAD - NIGHT Sebastian's car, traveling up a winding road, stars glittering above it, the lights of Los Angeles glittering below it. ,52600
The sky is a deep, painted blue. ,759000
Music plays... [PLANETARIUM] The car is bending around the turns, making its way up to... ,81500
A57 ...the real Griffith Observatory. ,32
There, our MUSIC crests. ,82900000
Our two characters get out of the car and wander, searching for an open entrance. ,111000
They find one -- and sneak in... 58 INT. GRIFFITH OBSERVATORY - CONTINUOUS They ascend a staircase. ,1160
Make their way past the exhibits -- the Tesla coil shooting off electric bolts. ,119000
They reach the pendulum, gaze up at the mural above it, look at one another. ,10600
Circle the pendulum, and then -- so tenderly, so nervously... ,6600
Revision 38. ...they begin to DANCE. This is a dance that fulfills all the promise in their earlier duet. ,220000
They circle the floor, gently and gracefully. ,18500
The music BUILDS, and they drift into... ,143000
A58 ...the PLANETARIUM. It's darkened, empty. ,321000
Mia removes her shoes, feels the soft carpet under her feet. ,Turns on the projector. ,7050000
The screen STARTS TO GLOW. She and Sebastian take in the sight -- the STARS and GALAXIES... ,54000
Enchanted, they look at one another, the lights from the screen reflected on their faces. ,272000
They approach, as though about to kiss... ,5400000
When -- -- Mia's shoes LIFT UP. Float toward the ceiling -- toward the star-filled screen. ,55500
She and Sebastian trade looks. ,2040000
Realize. ,14400000
And then they too begin to FLOAT... ...RISING from the floor, nothing stopping them. ,245000
SOARING past the views of comets and moons and nebulae. ,7790
Eyes wide, their emotions seized, as they HOLD EACH OTHER TIGHT... ,77700
And so unspools a gravity-free dance. ,12000
Mia and Sebastian SPIN and TWIRL through the planetarium as though they themselves were in outer space, flying through the cosmos. ,1260
The music carries them higher and higher, and their spirits likewise soar -- JOYOUS, EXUBERANT -- until, finally... ...the music SOFTENS. Mia and Sebastian drift back to the floor like feathers. ,11
They land on a pair of seats. ,67000
There, once again seated like audience members at a movie, they turn and look into each other's eyes. ,147000
The music picks back up for the big finish, as the lovers lean in and -- in true movie- movie old-Hollywood big-musical fashion -- -- LOCK LIPS. It's their first kiss, and it's a kiss to remember -- full of all the hope and yearning and terror and wonder of love's first blush. ,57
A swoon-worthy kiss, with the orchestra soaring and the camera swooping in to catch the embrace in all its glory. ,84
On this triumphant moment... ...we IRIS FADE OUT. Revision 39. 59 OMIT 60 INT. MIA'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY Mia's scribbling in a notebook. ,653
It's dialogue. ,25200000
We see character headings, scene headings. ,2630000
Seems to be some kind of a script... ,66800
TRACY (O.S.) What's that? ,11000000
Mia turns. ,6430
Tracy has wandered in -- pajamas, eating cereal. ,40000
TRACY (CONT'D) Is that a script? ,360000
MIA It's a play. ,21200000
I'm going to put it on myself. ,27500000
ALEXIS (O.S.) (chiming in from her bedroom) A play? ,10800
You better give us roles! MIA Actually -- it's a -- it's a one-woman show... ,215000
A beat -- and then -- AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHT. HONKING outside the nearest window. ,386000
It's a honk we recognize: TRACY ...Is that gonna happen every time? ,60700
MIA (glowing) I think so. ,40300000
A60 OMIT 61 EXT. MIA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY Mia dashes out -- and LEAPS into Sebastian's car and into his arms. ,1520
They KISS -- giddy, emotional, as though they'd been separated for years. ,155000
Sebastian drives off -- when -- MIA (O.S.) (CONT'D) It's one-way!! The car SCREECHES to a stop in front of a TRUCK going the opposite direction. ,16600
Sebastian goes into REVERSE as Mia cracks up laughing. ,69500
A BURST OF MUSIC as a title card pops on: Revision 40. ,620000
SUMMER The MUSIC carries us through the following series of GLIMPSES: 62 -- Mia and Sebastian ambling past weathered 30's bungalows in BUNKER HILL... 63 -- Mia guiding Sebastian down a street peppered with SILENT- ERA HOMES, past old gas-lamps and palms... 65 -- VAN BEEK. Sebastian gestures to the "TAPAS & TUNES" sign. ,6
Excitedly tries to deface it. ,904000
Mia, aghast, pulls him back... 66 -- The HUNTINGTON GARDENS, where Mia and Sebastian gaze at the tiny forest... ,156000
A66 -- WATTS TOWERS, where the two lovers stroll and kiss... 67 OMIT 64 -- The GRAND CENTRAL MARKET, where they grab food... 68 -- ANGEL'S FLIGHT at night, where they stumble and slip into a tipsy, love-soaked dance... 69 OMIT Interspersed throughout, WE SEE IMAGES OF LOS ANGELES: 1940's high-rises, green movie-movie lettering, ochre walls shaded by palm fronds, red flowers and Spanish missions, old lamps and Art Deco hotels. ,2
It's a gorgeous city, and the music only makes it more gorgeous -- building and carrying us to... 70 INT. LIGHTHOUSE CAFE - NIGHT A Lighthouse JAM SESSION. Sebastian's at the keys, having a blast. ,46200
The place is again mostly empty, but Mia is dancing her heart out. ,955000
She shoots looks at Sebastian. ,6020000
He laughs, plays out for her. ,1170000
The two of them are in their own world -- one of pure, unadulterated JOY... ,1830000
The song ends. ,479000
Sebastian rises, joins Mia. ,13300
They sit down as the band strikes up a new tune, and kiss. ,2460000
KEITH (O.S.) Sebastian? ,4580000
Mia and Sebastian look up, startled. ,18100
A YOUNG MAN, 35, is standing next to them. ,209000
Tall, fierce eyes. ,1820000
This is KEITH. SEBASTIAN Keith? ,213000
Revision 41. ,167000
KEITH Holy shit. ,65500
Come here, man. ,262000
Sebastian gets up. ,12100000
Gives him a hug. ,5450000
But Mia can sense an unease in Sebastian's eyes. ,34700
It's a strained hug. ,5570000
SEBASTIAN This is Mia. ,5910000
Mia, Keith. (explaining to Mia) We used to play together. ,280000
KEITH MIA Hey, Mia. ,324000
Hey... ,18400000
Sebastian sits back down. ,276000
Wants to end the conversation. ,1020000
KEITH So how've you been? ,13700000
SEBASTIAN Great. ,8570
You? ,58100000
KEITH Keeping busy. ,1500000
Got a new combo. ,27200000
SEBASTIAN Good for you. ,11900000
KEITH ...Looking for keys. ,1160000
SEBASTIAN (after a beat) I'm good. ,1510000
KEITH You sure? ,51900000
It pays. ,5610000
Sebastian looks at Keith. ,1780000
A moment. ,13300000
SEBASTIAN I'm good. ,32500000
Keith almost smiles. ,1650000
Expected this. ,615000
KEITH Let's just grab a drink then. ,86900
Call me. ,13900000
It's been too long. ,654000
SEBASTIAN You bet. ,3240000
KEITH Nice meeting you, Mia. ,878000
Revision 42. ,20500
MIA Nice meeting you. ,767000
Keith walks off. ,1160000
Mia and Sebastian look at each other. ,1700000
Then -- 71 INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT CLOSE ON MIA. She looks anxious. ,250000
CLOSE ON Sebastian. ,8730000
He looks head-over-heels in love. ,669000
SEBASTIAN It's beautiful. ,8790000
MIA ...You're just saying that. ,2570000
SEBASTIAN No... ,82100
I'm not. ,16200000
We PULL BACK -- and see a script on Mia's lap. ,354000
She's just finished reading Sebastian her play. ,1050000
MIA I don't know... ,9240000
Is the whole thing too nostalgic? ,207000
SEBASTIAN That's the point. ,209000000
MIA But do you think people will like it? ,27500000
SEBASTIAN Fuck `em. ,32300
MIA (laughs) You always say that. ,SEBASTIAN I truly believe it. ,144000
MIA Fine -- as long as you sit front-row `cause I'll probably throw up on the middle of the stage otherwise. ,3260
SEBASTIAN I'll be front-row. ,4230000
Mia looks at him. ,8490000
Smiles. ,13900000
It genuinely means the world to her. ,962000
Then, a glow in her eyes, wants to reciprocate -- Revision 43. ,6020
MIA I made something for you. ,41000000
She hops off the bed, fishes through a bag. ,396000
Pulls out a drawing. ,7870000
SEBASTIAN What's that? ,4680000
MIA It could be the name design. ,25400
On the door. ,3220000
SEBASTIAN Why does it say "Seb's"? ,4070000
MIA That's what you should name it. ,358000
SEBASTIAN Never. ,6560
MIA Sebastian, no one's going to a club called "Chicken on a Stick". ,4900000
SEBASTIAN You don't get it. ,78300000
Charlie Parker got the name "Bird" because he loved chicken. ,92900
So my club's gonna be old-school jazz and beer and chicken. "Chicken on a Stick". ,4410000
MIA No. Drop the chicken. ,59000
Drinks and jazz. (he rolls his eyes) And it's time to start looking for other places. ,107000
SEBASTIAN It's gotta be Van Beek. ,12300
I can't let them samba all over its history. ,2730000
MIA Make your own history. ,81500000
Sebastian looks at her. ,3740000
Appreciates that line. ,1630000
A beat. ,9650000
Then -- SEBASTIAN Your play's incredible. ,20300000
Mia smiles. ,206000
He approaches her, sits by her side. ,26800000
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) The whole world from your bedroom? ,301000
Who's doing that? ,669000
Revision 44. ,16000
MIA I'm doing that. ,12800000
They laugh. ,330000
MIA (CONT'D) So who was that guy at the Lighthouse? ,259000
SEBASTIAN ...Which guy? ,14300000
MIA The one who offered you a gig. ,2270000
SEBASTIAN You mean Keith? ,1090000
He's the worst. ,15800000
MIA Why was it weird between you two? ,109000000
SEBASTIAN It's always weird with him. ,392000
MIA He did offer you a job. ,18600000
SEBASTIAN Right... ,4360
MIA Are you going to call him? ,34500
MIA Ok... ,1310000
A moment passes. ,9390000
They lie down, side by side. ,79
SEBASTIAN Here's what we know. ,452000
It's definitely Chicken on a Stick -- (Mia rolls her eyes) -- and your play is going to be a triumph. ,49200
She looks at him. ,305000
He looks at her. ,450000
A shared smile. ,2880
And on that -- Revision 45. 72 INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - MORNING The next morning. ,177000
Sebastian is in bed. ,1560000
Hears snatches of Mia's voice -- she's on her phone in the other room: MIA (O.S.) ...No, Mom, it's a one-woman show... ,233000
No, I'm acting in it as well... ,13800000
No, I'm not getting paid, I'm paying to do it... (then,) He's great... ,659000
He's going to open his own jazz club. ,3330000
It's going to be incredible... (beat; then, softer --) Well he has to get the money together first, and... ,6470000
He's figuring it out... ,47
Yeah, it's just been a little tricky lately... ,627000
Sebastian listens. ,8510
Takes it in. ,9430000
MIA (O.S.) (CONT'D) Look -- he's going to find a way to open it and you're going to love it. ,277000
Ok? How's Dad? ,55300000
On Sebastian. ,828000
He thinks... 73 INT. REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY Sebastian enters. ,24100
Keith's combo is assembled. ,35600
It's a sign-up practice room in the West Valley. ,734000
There's a drummer, electric bassist, and trumpeter: COLE, MALCOLM and TOM. They're more polished in their looks than Sebastian. ,3730
Well-groomed beards, tighter jeans. ,256000
KEITH Sebastian. ,4820
Sebastian approaches. ,986
KEITH (CONT'D) Didn't know if I'd see you today. ,186000
SEBASTIAN (a bit awkward) Well... ,3530000
Here I am. ,20200000
A moment. ,13200000
Then -- SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Where's the piano? ,33500
Keith gestures -- to an electronic keyboard. ,6750
Sebastian winces. ,1950
Revision 46. ,15800
KEITH Here's the deal. ,56500
We've got distribution with Universal, got our own imprint. ,163000
We're about to go on the road. ,1890000
We can cut you in for 1K a week while we tour, plus an equal share of any merchandise or ticket revenue that comes in. ,32500
Sound good? ,1210000
We see Sebastian's face. ,107000
Taken aback. ,545000
KEITH (CONT'D) Sebastian? ,35300
SEBASTIAN Yeah, that...that... (beat) ...sounds good. ,153000
A moment. ,13300000
Keith smiles. ,2530
KEITH Let's play, see how it feels. ,987000
He pulls out a guitar. ,475000
Cole starts on drums. ,928000
Keith joins in. ,2000000
Malcolm and Tom follow suit. ,648000
Sebastian listens. ,7660
It sounds like modern jazz -- electronic in feel, but still jazz... ,1450000
Sebastian approaches the keyboard. ,2
Joins -- slowly, one step at a time. ,84200
Then begins playing out a bit more, his fingers starting to race. ,5080000
Malcolm gives Keith a look: "Damn". ,4480000
Keith gives Malcolm a look back: "I told you so." Bit by bit, Sebastian eases into the groove. ,23600
This isn't so bad... ,130000
Then -- Keith moves to a LAPTOP. Introduces a DRUM-MACHINE SAMPLE. Sebastian, into the music, is caught off-guard. ,1700
Uneasy now. ,21800
This isn't him... ,38800
Keith plays a riff on his guitar. ,1110000
Tom echoes it on bass, then Malcolm on trumpet. ,69300
Now it's Sebastian's turn. ,133000
He hesitates. ,58100
And then -- finally -- he plays the riff... ,3110000
It doesn't feel so bad. ,950000
The guys build on the riff. ,178000
Sebastian keeps up with them, trying to let go of his presuppositions. ,3970000
After all -- these guys can play... ,35300000
The music builds, the whole thing swelling and finally CARRYING US TO -- A73 LATER: Sebastian and Keith sit across from each other as the other players pack up. ,9720
Sebastian looks pensive. ,1870000
Noticing -- Revision 47. ,KEITH (CONT'D) I know. ,205000
It's different. ,9550000
Then, leaning in -- KEITH (CONT'D) But you say you want to save jazz. ,174000
How are you going to save jazz if no one's listening? ,1790000
Jazz wouldn't exist if people hadn't gotten tired of what they were listening to before. (then,) I mean, do you really think a bunch of ninety-year-olds in a basement is the future of the form? ,25500
Traditionalists whined when Kenny Clarke started dropping bombs. ,18600
If traditionalists had their way, we'd still be playing Dixieland. ,293000
Sebastian considers this. ,27
As much as he might make a play of resisting -- we can tell the words are getting to him... ,3390000
SEBASTIAN You're holding onto the past. ,1890000
But jazz is about the future. ,5920000
A moment. ,13700000
Then -- KEITH I get it. ,7030000
I got it wrong. ,5770000
Last guy wasn't as good as you. ,30600000
But you're a pain in the ass, man. ,1070000
Sebastian nods. ,328
Knows he can't argue with that. ,3120000
Another beat. ,93000
KEITH (CONT'D) If it's not your thing, just let me know. ,1970000
I don't want you uncomfortable and trying to change this into something it's not. ,44900000
But if you want it -- the job's yours. ,76300000
Sebastian looks at Keith. ,1870000
A moment. ,13200000
He's really weighing this. ,619000
And on that -- his look of uncertainty -- we're -- 74 OMIT 75 OMIT 76 OMIT 77 OMIT Revision 48. 77pt INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - DUSK The door opens. ,15500
Mia enters. ,6110
Takes a deep breath. ,2180000
Hears piano. ,115000
Steps forward and sees Sebastian at his piano -- playing a melody we've heard before. [CITY OF STARS AS DUET] She smiles. ,67600
Sebastian begins to SING. Mia sits down beside him and begins to SING as well. ,33800
They share a duet -- simple, unaffected, hopeful -- the music just perhaps suggesting their uncertainty about what they might be about to do... ,2930
As the vocals give way to instrumentation, we're -- A77 OMIT B77 OMIT C77 OMIT 78 INT. DINER - DAY Sebastian and Keith hunched over paperwork. ,24

They shake hands... 85 INT. GREEN ROOM - EVENING Sebastian and the band in a green room, waiting. ,83900
Sebastian's wearing the new suit. ,4060000
Looking sharper... ,230000
Revision 49. 86 INT. VINTAGE SHOP - DAY Mia looking for PROPS. Another wild assortment -- a TOP HAT, a CANE, a DIORAMA of London, rolled-up MAPS, an old GLOBE... 87 OMIT 88 INT. APARTMENT - DAY We MOVE IN on a laptop. ,63

The last lyrics resonating as they look into one another's eyes: SEBASTIAN MIA City of stars... ,156000
You've never shined so brightly. ,507000
Revision 50. ,111000
On that -- this image of love, Sebastian playing out the final chords on his piano -- WE GO DARK. All sound fades out. ,22400
And then, we hear -- -- a CROWD CHEERING. [START A FIRE] We see -- a white spotlight. ,138000
It reveals Sebastian. ,10
We're -- 91 INT. THE ECHO - NIGHT Sebastian is on-stage. ,130000
He's the only musician we can see. ,236000
The floor beyond the stage is FILLED with people. ,924000
Among them, we spot Mia -- beaming with pride. ,171000
Sebastian sees her, smiles to her as he plays a piano intro. ,68300
Mia grins right back, heart swelling... ,3140000
A SECOND SPOTLIGHT turns on, illuminating Keith. ,13500
He SINGS. He has a beautiful voice. ,10300000
Mia bobs her head. ,3
It's just Keith and Sebastian right now, all acoustic, a simple, catchy tune... ,131000
And then -- suddenly -- a DRUM MACHINE SURGES IN -- and -- BOOM! The entire CLUB is lit up as the MUSIC EXPLODES. A full- fledged dance beat and a thick radio-ready electronic track. ,704
Mia is taken aback. ,11900000
But she keeps bobbing her head -- as the crowd around her GOES CRAZY... ,121000
Keith owns the stage, as Sebastian plays out more -- now switched to an electronic keyboard, complete with synth sounds. ,289000
We recognize fragments of melody from when Keith and Sebastian first rehearsed -- but the tune has been transformed beyond recognition. ,8050
Not a hint of jazz... ,625000
Keith breaks into the CHORUS -- and a TRIO OF BACKUP SINGERS are revealed stage-left. ,55200
The band surges into the song's bridge -- and BACKUP DANCERS appear stage-right, scantily- clad. ,23500
And then -- the lights go NUTS. It's a full-out LIGHT SHOW now, shafts of red, blue, green and orange cutting through the dark. ,9060
The crowd starts CHEERING, pumping their fists... ,288000
Mia looks at Sebastian. ,4610000
He's not fighting any of this. ,14900000
He sees her. ,308000
She smiles. ,431000
But something is changing in her expression... ,1920000
She looks at the lights, the singers, the dancers, Sebastian and his bandmates in matching magazine-cover-ready outfits. ,14300
She looks at the crowd around her -- their hollers growing more and more frenzied as Sebastian launches into a prolonged SOLO... ,16400
Revision 51. ,98200
Mia looks back at him, takes it all in: Is this really him...? ,15200000
As the mass of people swells and moves, Mia finds herself PUSHED TO THE SIDE, bit by bit, away from the center... ,81800
She tries to hold her ground, but is edged FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY. Sebastian, deep in his solo, doesn't notice. ,37200
Mia tugs against the tide of the crowd, but to no avail. ,2080
She's pushed to the back of the club, away from the lights and into shadow... ,835000
The final chorus begins -- floor-shaking, fist-pounding. ,20900
We linger on Mia's face -- watching as the band feverishly tear into their climactic bars, the dancers on-stage and the crowd below busting out one last burst of CRAZED CHOREOGRAPHY -- ending the song just as we SMASH CUT TO A TITLE CARD OVER BLACK: FALL Silence. ,26
We take a moment to collect ourselves before -- 92 OMIT 93 EXT. / INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - LOS ANGELES - DAY CLOSE on Mia. ,7840
She looks tired. ,2300000
A bit weathered. ,10300000
She's nursing a green tea across from Laura. ,2020000
They've finished eating. ,6560000
LAURA Look at him -- watch -- Mia glances out the window. ,381000
A MAN in his early 40's has just parked, is walking around his car, inspecting it. ,136000
LAURA (CONT'D) Now he's going to check the other window. ,32900000
Yep, it's closed. ,748000
Now he's going to check again. ,70700000
Yep, still closed. ,7890000
Mia smiles. ,206000
The MAN enters the restaurant -- greets Mia -- and kisses Laura. ,37700
This is HARRY. Her new boyfriend. ,3080000
HARRY Hey. ,64000
I'm grabbing some pastries, you two want anything? ,3000000
MIA Thanks Harry, I'm good. ,547000
Revision 52. ,14500
LAURA Same here but I think someone's trying to break into your car. ,75000
Harry rolls his eyes, heads to the front. ,83100
Laura looks at Mia. ,8330000
LAURA (CONT'D) Don't stress about the play. ,223000
Where's Seb now? ,3810000
MIA I think today's San Diego. ,7370000
I'm not sure... ,22900000
A moment passes. ,9290000
LAURA You should come over tonight. ,84600000
Harry's cooking, but don't let that stop you. (Mia manages a smile; a beat) What's the matter? ,334000
MIA Nothing... ,2700
LAURA You miss him. ,17200000
MIA I guess. ,8900000
I'm adapting. ,5750000
LAURA (nods; then,) I got used to being alone. ,776000
Growing up it was just me and Seb. ,38300
We only had each other. ,28300000
MIA He told me. ,14100000
LAURA I wasn't looking for anybody. ,1640000
Then I met Harry and -- we just fit... (Mia smiles) You've changed Seb. ,5120
You know that? ,152000000
Laura means it positively -- but Mia seems concerned... ,144000
MIA Do you think he's happy? ,26700000
LAURA Is he happy? ,14200000
MIA I mean with the band, the travel, all of it. ,22400000
Revision 53. ,72100
Laura shrugs. ,1510
LAURA Our dad never got to do what he wanted. ,16200000
We were always treading water, he took a job running a washer-dryer store. ,112000
But every night at home he'd play his clarinet along to a Benny Goodman record. (a beat) So I look at Sebastian... ,3830
Playing music, getting paid for it. ,21000000
I'm happy for him. ,740000
She notices Harry through the window, returning. ,98700
Her thoughts drift. ,1040000
LAURA (CONT'D) Dreams change. ,47400
A beat. ,9690000
She looks back at Mia. ,906000
Sees her worry. ,132000
LAURA (CONT'D) Don't overthink it. ,176000
He'll be home soon. ,1630000
Harry rejoins the table. ,8690000
Hands Laura a sponge cake. ,52900
LAURA (CONT'D) I told you not to get me anything! HARRY Oh, right -- I'll eat it I guess. ,9960
LAURA No -- I changed my mind. ,56000
They laugh. ,339000
Kiss. ,17900000
Tender. ,14900000
Loving. ,14400000
Mia watches... 94 INT. DINER - NIGHT Mia eats, her laptop next to her meal. ,38600
She takes a bite, types. ,93500
We see her screen -- an e-mail draft, glimpses of words: "one- woman show", "one night only", "7pm", "I would be thrilled..." She thinks. ,10000
Picks up her phone. ,8490000
Dials Sebastian. ,3770
Waits. ,10300000
No answer. ,2190000
MIA Hey it's me... ,5500000
Not sure where you are -- maybe Boston? ,3920000
Or Dallas? ,11800000
Anyway... ,14300000
I haven't heard from you in a while... ,177000
I miss you... (a beat) Ok... ,127000
Bye... ,15300000
Resumes typing. ,3680
Revision 54. 95 INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT COMPLEX / APARTMENT - NIGHT Mia walks through the courtyard. ,5880
Reaches the door. ,353000
Then hears something... ,2410000
Music -- LOUD, FAST JAZZ... ,1540000
She enters -- has to jostle the door handle to do so -- -- and then freezes in place. ,14300
Sebastian is sashaying around a fully-decked table, lighting candles as he moves. ,46300
He looks up, sees her -- and grins. ,2470000
SEBASTIAN Surprise. ,1070
She lights up. ,51200000
He lifts up silver serving trays, revealing what he's cooked. ,317000
Roast chicken. ,2240000
Pasta. ,15500000
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) And... (he hurries to the kitchen -- and holds up a big apple pie) There's twenty-five pounds of apples in it. ,1450
It probably destroyed an ecosystem but it tastes good. ,4440
Mia laughs. ,1920
Can't believe it. ,4710000
Sebastian looks at her -- sincere now. ,13000
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) I have to head back in the morning but I needed to see you. ,303000
Mia's eyes seem almost on the brink of tears. ,974000
Beyond moved, she runs into Sebastian's arms. ,133000
A LONG, HEARTFELT KISS... 96 INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - EVENING CLOSE ON: The record player. ,636
An old jazz track. ,54900000
We see Mia and Sebastian seated at the table -- eating, drinking, laughing. ,23600
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Feels so good to be home. ,297000
MIA Stay. ,5940
He smiles. ,312000
SEBASTIAN How's the play going? ,55200000
MIA I'm nervous. ,566000
Revision 55. ,12900
SEBASTIAN Why? ,6850
MIA Because... (a beat) What if people show up? ,168000
SEBASTIAN Fuck `em! Laughter. ,152000
Then -- SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) You're nervous about what they think? ,97300
MIA I'm nervous to be up on a stage and perform in front of people. ,425000
I'm terrified. ,4040000
SEBASTIAN They should be so lucky to see it. (then,) It's going to be incredible. ,3580000
I can't wait. ,5380000
MIA I can. ,8850000
A smile. ,13300000
Beat. ,17500000
MIA (CONT'D) What time do you leave in the morning? ,163000
SEBASTIAN 6:45. ,8760000
MIA Ugh. ,1370
SEBASTIAN Yep. ,2150
Boise. ,14500000
MIA Boise? ,4320
SEBASTIAN (nods) You should come. ,571000
MIA To Boise? ,13000000
Revision 56. ,12100
SEBASTIAN Yeah, you could knock that off your bucket list. ,484000
Mia laughs. ,2100
MIA Wish I could. ,3560000
SEBASTIAN Why can't you? ,185000
MIA Come to Boise? ,8310000
SEBASTIAN Yeah. ,2890
MIA Because I have to rehearse. ,1740000
SEBASTIAN Can't you rehearse anywhere? ,4680000
She looks at him. ,320000
MIA You mean anywhere you are? ,205000
SEBASTIAN ...I -- I guess... ,4770000
MIA Well, all my stuff is here and my show's in a few weeks and -- I don't know, it doesn't seem practical... ,760000
SEBASTIAN Right... ,4260
I just -- we're going to have to do things so we can see each other. ,4630000
We never see each other. ,196000
MIA I know, but when are you done? ,151000
SEBASTIAN ...What do you mean? ,115000000
MIA When are you done with the tour? ,704000
Revision 57. ,11700
SEBASTIAN But -- as soon as we're done with the tour we go back and record, and then we go back on tour. ,682000
Mia looks at him. ,5210000
Doesn't seem to understand. ,1440000
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) We tour so we can make the record, and then we go back on tour to sell the record. ,17900
Beat. ,17700000
Mia takes this in. ,6080000
MIA So it's...the long haul? ,34300000
SEBASTIAN ...What does that mean? ,4560000
MIA I mean the long haul -- like, you're going to be in this band for a long time. ,309000
SEBASTIAN What did you think I was going to do? ,60300000
MIA I don't know, I didn't think the band would -- SEBASTIAN You didn't think we'd be successful. ,698000
MIA No, that's not what I meant. ,4350000
What I meant was -- this band -- you're going to be on the road for -- what, years now? ,1020000
SEBASTIAN Yeah, feasibly -- I could be on the road for years with just this record. ,4910000
Beat. ,17700000
MIA Do you like the music you're playing? ,25000000
SEBASTIAN I don't know how that matters. ,2850000
MIA It matters if you're going to give up your dream to be on the road for years. ,386000
Revision 58. ,12200
SEBASTIAN Do you like the music I'm playing? ,91400000
MIA Yes. ,10000
I do. (beat) I just didn't think you did. ,7860000
SEBASTIAN Yeah, well, I -- MIA And now I hear you're going to be on the road for years, and I'm -- SEBASTIAN What are you doing? ,123000
Why are you doing this? ,745000
MIA What do you mean why am I doing this? ,266000
SEBASTIAN This is what you wanted from me. ,1820000
MIA To be in this band? ,6000000
SEBASTIAN To have a steady job. ,2930000
MIA Yes, I wanted you to have a job so you could take care of yourself and start your club. ,2740000
SEBASTIAN So I'm doing that. ,4660000
So why aren't we celebrating? ,1770000
MIA Why aren't you starting your club? ,22700000
SEBASTIAN You said yourself no one wants to go to that club! No one wants to go to a club called Chicken on a Stick -- MIA Change the name! SEBASTIAN -- and no one likes jazz. ,8530
Not even you. ,239000
Revision 59. ,14200
MIA I do like jazz now, because of you. ,7670000
SEBASTIAN (not listening to her) What am I supposed to do? ,9360000
Go back to playing "Jingle Bells" so I can save money for some Shangri-La club no one wants to go to? ,4150000
MIA People will want to go to it! People love what other people are passionate about. ,10000000
SEBASTIAN Not in my experience. ,34500000
A beat. ,9550000
Mia realizes she's getting nowhere. ,167000
A moment of quiet. ,4560000
Then -- SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Anyway -- it's time to grow up. ,45900
You know? ,18000000
This is what I'm doing. ,39400000
If you had a problem, I wish you would've said something earlier, before I signed on the dotted line. ,342000
MIA (trying again) You had a dream that you were sticking to, that -- SEBASTIAN This is the dream! MIA This is not your dream. ,28800
SEBASTIAN Guys like me go their whole lives and never do anything that's liked. ,153000
I'm finally doing something that people enjoy. ,77700000
What is wrong with that? ,5110000
MIA Why do you care so much about being liked -- ? ,4000000
SEBASTIAN (finally bursting--) You're an actress, who are you to talk?? ,1540000
Silence. ,15500000
We suddenly realize -- Revision 60. -- the LP has finished. ,89800
You can hear the needle scratch against it now -- back and forth, back and forth. ,564000
Sebastian looks at Mia. ,1860000
A moment. ,13300000
Finally -- SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Maybe you liked me more when I was a failure because it made you feel better about yourself. ,15800
Mia looks back at him. ,1190000
Can't believe he said that. ,2220000
Tears starting to well in her eyes. ,2710000
She tries to suppress them. ,6570000
MIA Are you kidding? ,2810000
SEBASTIAN No. They stare at each other. ,3510000
Then -- all of a sudden -- the FIRE ALARM blares. ,84700
Sebastian turns and sees smoke billowing from the KITCHEN. A dish in the oven has started to burn. ,23800
Sebastian rises, springs toward the kitchen -- then sees Mia grabbing her things. ,79100
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Wait -- But she's out the door. ,204000
It slams shut, as Sebastian pulls the burnt apple pie from the oven. ,5380
And on that -- WE SMASH CUT TO -- 97 OMIT 98 EXT. THEATER - DAY A poster, placed on the front of the theater we saw before. ,976
A title. ,12900000
A name below it: "MIA DOLAN." And a word: "TONIGHT." We spot Mia, carrying a box of props. ,44200
She enters the theater. ,1100000
And we're -- 99 INT. THEATER - DAY The empty theater. ,781000
Dark. ,19200000
Silent. ,15500000
Then -- a light turns on. ,5110000
Mia steps in. ,14300000
We stay WIDE. She seems small from this vantage point, surrounded by her props and backdrops. ,88
She takes a moment. ,274000
Looks at all the empty seats. ,104000
Revision 61. ,12100
Takes a deep breath. ,2180000
Nervous. ,13400000
And then, nodding to herself -- you can do this -- she starts setting up... 100 INT. PRACTICE SPACE - DAY A BLAST of music. ,56300
The Messengers have just finished a rehearsal. ,2090000
Sebastian packs his stuff, heads toward the exit, nodding to the others -- SEBASTIAN COLE See you tomorrow. ,429
See ya. -- when -- KEITH You good for tonight, right? ,520000
Sebastian stops. ,2400
Looks at Keith. ,8460000
SEBASTIAN ...Tonight? ,10900
KEITH Seven. ,21500
The photo shoot. (reading Sebastian's face, adding --) Mojo. ,544000
A beat. ,9690000
Sebastian is confused. ,8560000
SEBASTIAN I thought that was next Thursday. ,1270000
KEITH No. It's tonight. ,4360000
We linger on Sebastian for a moment... ,428000
KEITH (CONT'D) Is that ok? 101 EXT. REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY Sebastian stands out front. ,62600
Checks his watch. ,8620000
Thinks... 102 OMIT 103 INT. THEATER / INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT People are shuffling into the theater. ,1730
We DRIFT BACKSTAGE. Mia, now in a male suit and tie, watches behind a curtain. ,65300
Checks her phone. 7:04. ,2990000
Breathes in. ,137000
Nervous, and alone... ,8660000
She turns. ,776000
Nods to the OWNER, off to the side. ,4620000
He heads to a switch, and the lights GO DOWN. Revision 62. ,193000
You can hear the murmurs beyond the curtain. ,12300
The audience, expecting. ,12900000
Mia tries to get her nerves under control. ,38500
She can do this... ,1480000
Sets her phone aside -- one last breath -- -- and walks out. 104 OMIT 105 OMIT 106 INT. PHOTO STUDIO - NIGHT LOUD MUSIC. It's the band's song, blaring from a speaker. ,642
They're pantomiming -- the musicians styled and ready for their close-ups. ,104000
A PHOTOGRAPHER grabs shots. ,2710000
PHOTOGRAPHER Put a light on the drums... ,96800
I need more fill in this corner... ,139000
We ZERO IN on Sebastian. ,289000
His hair sticks out at various angles. ,3040000
An artfully-undone tie hangs from his neck. ,446000
He fake-plays, as Keith pretends to lay in sampled beats... ,24900
Keith, Tom, Malcolm, Cole -- they all grin, as excited as kids. ,1610000
Sebastian looks at them -- then down at his elaborate outfit, then back up at the Photographer running around, then at his watch... ,13500
PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D) Bass, head up. ,329000
Piano, look down at the keys. ,25000000
Sebastian does as told, but his thoughts are elsewhere. ,1280000
The Photographer moves in close, SNAPPING shots of just him -- PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D) Cut the music. ,6700
Turn the keyboard live. ,2400000
Piano look up, play. ,44100
The track stops. ,6910000
Sebastian stops as well. ,698000
The CLICKS of the Photographer's camera loud now. ,601000
PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D) No -- piano -- actually play something. ,245000
Sebastian is still. ,8590000
Then he starts to play a single melody on the keys. ,96600
We recognize it. ,8440000
The first notes of his and Mia's song... ,26400000
Revision 63. ,448000
PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D) Good, now bite your lip like you're concentrating on a solo. ,29600
Beat. ,17500000
Sebastian stops. ,2120
Silence. ,15500000
He stares ahead. ,1570000
PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D) That was good. ,171000
Don't stop. ,4930000
We PUSH IN on Sebastian... 107 INT. THEATER - NIGHT We're CLOSE on Mia. ,166000
In ordinary clothes now. ,2180000
Behind her is a wallpapered wall, and a small window. ,5080000
By her side are the globe we saw in her room, and other little trinkets: a pearl necklace, an old suitcase, a roll of maps. ,2690
Outside the window, projection of a starlit Parisian night sky. ,41700
Completely silent, Mia moves to a lamp, turns it off. ,199000
We go BLACK. Then -- the house lights go on. ,26600000
White, fluorescent. ,147000
Thin applause can be heard. ,856000
Mia manages a smile, as we finally see -- -- that the theater is less than a quarter full. ,481000
Mia takes a bow. ,1030000
Peers out. ,70200
One seat, in the front row, has a "RESERVED" sign on it. ,1310000
The seat is empty. 108 OMIT 109 INT. THEATER - DRESSING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER Mia slips inside, holding in her hurt. ,29
Starts collecting a few outfits -- then overhears two AUDIENCE MEMBERS outside -- AUDIENCE MEMBER #1 (O.S.) I swear to God, if I have to hear one more hipster waxing nostalgic I'm gonna slit my wrists. ,3360
AUDIENCE MEMBER #2 (O.S.) Seriously. ,1790000
AUDIENCE MEMBER #1 (O.S.) She's not even good. ,2020000
That window thing...? ,435000
AUDIENCE MEMBER #2 (O.S.) Christ... ,1570000
Don't quit your day job... ,85300000
Revision 64. ,12100
Laughter. ,13000000
Mia freezes. ,92
The nail in the coffin. ,925000
The voices fade. ,8100000
She slides into a chair. 110 EXT. THEATER - NIGHT Sebastian SPEEDING. Screeching to a stop. ,54
He's at Mia's THEATER. He dashes out and runs to the door. ,426000
But it's locked. ,220000
No one's in sight. ,4430000
Fuck. ,20300000
He spins around, frantic -- when Mia appears from an adjacent doorway, alone and carrying her box of props to her car. ,587
SEBASTIAN Mia! She turns. ,1220000
Sees him. ,459000
He runs to her. ,801000
WRAPS his arms around -- SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) I'm sorry -- -- and KISSES her. ,7040
The kind of kiss that might once have swept her off her feet. ,1700000
He starts to move with her... ...starts to DANCE -- but -- MIA Stop -- She pulls away. ,1580000
Steps back. ,551000
Sebastian looks at her. ,3490000
Unmoored. ,144000
SEBASTIAN I'm -- I'm sorry I missed it -- and I'm sorry I was a dick and I -- I promise I'll make it up to you -- MIA It's over. ,48000
She doesn't say the words with any anger. ,7250000
Just acceptance. ,9610
SEBASTIAN (a beat; then --) ...What do you mean? ,11900000
MIA I'm done embarrassing myself. ,92100
SEBASTIAN You didn't embarrass yourself... ,37600000
Revision 65. ,11700
MIA No one showed up. ,23500
I can't even pay back the theater. ,2940000
She says this as though just realizing it. ,6370000
Sebastian looks at her. ,3750000
A moment passes. ,9090000
He doesn't know what to say now. ,55100000
MIA (CONT'D) I'm gonna go home for a while. ,223000
SEBASTIAN ...This is home. ,4570000
MIA Not anymore. ,12900000
Sebastian is silent now. ,921000
A tear in his eye. ,2310000
He clenches his jaw. ,29800
Mia looks at him one more time, steps into her car, and drives off. ,86300
Sebastian lingers. ,2860
Doesn't move. ,2030000
Then, music. ,14000000
Soft, melancholy, just piano, as... 111 OMIT A111 OMIT ...WE DISSOLVE TO: 112 OMIT 113 EXT. MIA'S CAR - DAY Mia drives, boxes stacked in the back. ,46800
A113 She gets on the 405... ,9990
Heading out of the city... 114 EXT. / INT. MIA'S HOUSE - NEVADA - DUSK Mia steps inside a modest house. ,47400
Her MOM is by the door. ,1970000
Hugs her. ,206000
Her DAD stands by the hallway. 115 INT. MIA'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DUSK Mia enters her old bedroom. ,24200
Slides in a suitcase. ,6840000
Moves a couple of boxes from the hall. ,6310000
Looks around. ,352000
Old photos. ,13000000
Old soccer trophies. ,1450000
She sits down on the bed. ,5720000
Takes a breath. ,7810000
And, finally, we're... 116 EXT. ORANGE GROVE - DAY Laura and Harry's ENGAGEMENT PARTY. We're outside, in a sun- dappled grove. ,63000
A small gathering. ,11000000
Revision 66. ,11100
Sebastian plays a baby grand piano -- the source, we realize, of the music we've been hearing... ,82500
As he watches Laura dance with her new fiancé -- this woman he has known for so many years as a romantic cynic, now once again full of all the youthful innocence of first love -- his thoughts seem to drift. ,1230
The music comes to a close and... 117 LATER: Sebastian with Laura, by the orange trees... ,128000
LAURA You remember the McKenzies? ,93400
SEBASTIAN Oh God, I didn't see them. ,4420000
LAURA Yeah. ,6660
They kept going, "oh Sebastian's so handsome". ,152000
Sebastian smiles. ,2730
Then -- SEBASTIAN You look beautiful. (beat) I hope it was ok. ,1210000
I haven't played in a while. ,3260000
LAURA You were great (pause) You're always great when you play. ,359000
Sebastian is silent. ,11700000
Then -- LAURA (CONT'D) Now -- listen to me. ,3480000
I want you to save for a down payment. ,6060000
You understand? ,13000000
You need a home. ,92500000
SEBASTIAN Yes ma'am. ,278000
LAURA I'm not gonna be hovering anymore. ,1730000
SEBASTIAN ...You still think New York? ,4790000
LAURA I think so. ,9000000
Maybe Boston. ,6790
I don't know, it's exciting... ,11600000
Sebastian smiles again. ,300000
Some calls from the distance -- Revision 67. ,255000
LAURA (CONT'D) Ah I gotta -- the future in-laws... ,21700
She lights up. ,51300000
Likes the sound of that. ,872000
LAURA (CONT'D) Is my...my hair...? ,203000
Sebastian, without a word, pulls a strand back. ,108000
Laura smiles, kisses him on the cheek. ,97
A quiet, tender moment. ,192000
Then she hurries off. ,105000
Sebastian stands there. ,1080000
Watches... ,16900000
WE FADE OUT. 118 INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - MORNING RINGING. Sebastian is awoken. ,640
Groaning, he rolls over. ,47500
Lets the phone ring. ,9730000
It keeps going. ,351000
Endless... ,14900000
Finally, fed up, he reaches for it. ,756000
Answers -- SEBASTIAN What...? ,9880000
WOMAN #2 (O.S.) Hi, I'm trying to reach Mia Dolan. ,20500000
Sebastian is taken aback. ,11500000
He goes to hang up, saying just -- SEBASTIAN Wrong number. ,160000
WOMAN #2 (O.S.) -- She's not answering her cell and I was told I might find her here. ,20400000
Sebastian pauses. ,832
Hurt by the mere mention of Mia's name -- SEBASTIAN Yeah, well...not anymore. ,21300
WOMAN #2 (O.S.) Ok. If you do talk to her -- SEBASTIAN I won't. ,20400000
WOMAN #2 (O.S.) -- please tell her Jane at Amy Brandt Casting is trying to reach her. ,20300000
Sebastian sits up. ,8960000
Suddenly wide-eyed. ,1030000
SEBASTIAN "Casting"...? ,1270000
Revision 68. 119 INT. MIA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT Dinner has just finished. ,132000
Mia's Mom gives her a kiss -- MIA'S MOM MIA Night, sweetie. ,2480000
Night, Mom. -- and heads off, as Mia and her Dad stay behind. ,1590000
Getting up to scrape the dish -- MIA'S DAD You want some more rice? ,381000
MIA I'm ok. ,48100
MIA'S DAD You look hungry. ,4630000
MIA I'm good... ,5670000
A moment. ,13700000
Mia's Dad puts a few more dishes away, then sits back down across from her. ,247000
MIA'S DAD It's fun having you back. ,4680000
Your mom ditches me at ten. ,479000
Mia laughs. ,1920
A moment. ,13200000
MIA You took down the swing. ,143000
MIA'S DAD She made me. ,172000
A smile. ,13400000
MIA'S DAD (CONT'D) I've still got all your old tapes. ,98400
MIA Oh God. ,155000
Throw those away. ,11800
MIA'S DAD Never. ,9290000
Just then -- a loud, persistent HONK. Mia's Dad looks up, eyebrow raised. ,9170
Mia turns, hearing it as well. ,98600
The HONKING is nearby -- just outside... ,87300
Mia's thoughts suddenly sharpen. ,105000
Ears perk up. ,2820000
She's heard the honking before: Revision 69. ,161000
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHT. MIA'S DAD (CONT'D) What the hell...? ,161000
Disbelief on Mia's face. ,19000000
It can't be. ,96800000
She heads to the nearest window. ,621000
There -- at the corner, smack-dab in front of her house -- is SEBASTIAN'S CAR. A NEIGHBOR angrily yells at him. ,1370
Sebastian sees Mia. ,802000
They lock eyes. ,12000
And on that -- 120 EXT. MIA'S HOME / SEBASTIAN'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER Mia and Sebastian stand next to his car. ,9330
MIA Why did you come here? ,60500000
SEBASTIAN Because I have good news. ,188000
MIA Ok... ,1250000
SEBASTIAN Amy Brandt. ,430000
The casting director. ,12500000
MIA I know who she is. ,30000000
SEBASTIAN She was at your play. ,2680000
And she loved it. ,1150000
And she loved it so much that she wants you to come audition for a huge movie she's got. ,1470000
He's brimming over with excitement. ,246000
But Mia just shakes her head. ,1110000
MIA I'm not going. ,62900
SEBASTIAN ...Excuse me? ,8700000
MIA I'm -- no... ,1150000000
That will kill me. ,776000
SEBASTIAN That's it? ,9530000
MIA Yes. ,10000
Revision 70. ,12700
SEBASTIAN So you're happy here? ,11700000
MIA I'm happier. ,5220000
SEBASTIAN Why won't you come? ,7830000
MIA I told you. ,708000
SEBASTIAN I don't buy it. ,53600000
MIA (finally letting it out, fed up --) Because it's another audition! (a beat; then --) I've been to hundreds of auditions. ,108000
Do you want to know what happens? ,4030000
Either they interrupt me because someone ordered a sandwich, or they cut me off after two seconds, or I'm crying and they start laughing, or I'm one of a hundred lookalikes in the waiting room who never has a chance, because -- (beat) -- because -- SEBASTIAN Because what? ,20800
MIA Because I'm probably not good enough. ,2170000
SEBASTIAN Yes you are. ,27800000
MIA No. Maybe I'm not. ,387000
MIA (CONT'D) Maybe I'm one of those people who's always wanted to do it but never had a chance. ,86200
It's a pipe dream. ,804000
Maybe it's like you said. ,66500000
Maybe I need to grow up. ,3660000
She hesitates. ,71800
Continues -- Revision 71. ,2460000
MIA (CONT'D) I can go back to school. ,117000
I can find something else that I'm supposed to do. ,24600000
I left school to give it a shot, and it didn't work out, and it took six years, and I don't want to do it anymore. ,43700
Beat. ,17600000
But Sebastian isn't giving up. ,112000
SEBASTIAN Why? ,6500
MIA Why what? ,9530000
SEBASTIAN Why don't you want to do it anymore? ,1900000
Mia thinks about this one for a moment. ,6820000
MIA ...Because it hurts a little bit too much. ,952000
Sebastian shakes his head. ,315000
Nope. ,4790000
Won't accept this. ,73100000
SEBASTIAN I told them you'd be there at five-thirty tomorrow. ,656000
I'll swing by here before I drive back at eight. ,425000
Either you'll be outside or you won't. ,11400000
With that, he gets back into his car. ,30000000
Mia is silent. ,8120000
Then -- MIA How did you find me? ,97700000
Sebastian turns. ,3640
Points. ,18300000
Matter-of-fact -- SEBASTIAN The house across from the library. ,7340000
He drives off. ,178000
Mia looks up. ,9430000
There, sure enough, is the LIBRARY, crouched on the corner. ,92200
The library that once helped set her on her path to acting. ,10600000
She looks at it. ,199000
Thinks... 121 EXT. MIA'S STREET - NIGHT/DAY Wide on the street. ,45300
All is quiet. ,22700000
Night becomes morning... ,14100000
Revision 72. 122 EXT. MIA'S HOME - DAY Sebastian's car pulls over. ,1250
He sits there. ,70400
Sips a coffee, a second coffee in the holder. ,156000
The time: 8:02. ,20500000
A moment passes. ,9240000
He taps the wheel. ,5840000
Looks at the house. ,22
The front door remains closed. ,1180000
No Mia. ,458000
He leans back. ,1420000
Seems worried. ,16100
Closes his eyes, breathes out. ,34200
We MOVE CLOSE on him. ,773000
He breathes in and out again... ,988000
He opens his eyes. 8:10. ,32700000
The door's still closed. ,1120000
Resigned, he starts his car up, BEGINS TO PULL AWAY, when -- -- BAM! A KNOCK on the opposite window. ,76
He jumps. ,360000
It's Mia. ,120000
She's just arrived at the car from the other side, two just-bought cups of coffee and a bag of pastries in her hands. ,13600
Sebastian smiles. ,2730
Then OPENS the door for her. 123 OMIT 124 EXT. PARAMOUNT STUDIO LOT - DAY A cloudy late afternoon. ,283000
Mia and Sebastian slowly walk through the lot together. ,45400
They pass the New York street, the murals and posters of classic Hollywood, the old Art Deco ornaments and the big soundstages and backdrops. ,2230
Neither says a word... 125 INT. WAITING LOBBY - DAY Mia and Sebastian are seated. ,95
Waiting. ,17200000
The DOOR opens. ,11300000
An ACTRESS exits. ,188000
A second later -- ASSISTANT #2 Mia? ,3200000
Mia gathers her nerves. ,20800
Gets up. ,13100000
And steps in. 126 INT. AUDITION ROOM / INT. LOBBY - DAY In the room is AMY BRANDT -- mid-forties. ,73
Seated behind her is the director, FRANK. AMY BRANDT MIA Hi, Mia. ,121000
Hi. AMY BRANDT I'm Amy, this is Frank. ,1010000
Glad we found you. ,434000
Mia nods. ,1940
Smiles. ,13800000
A moment. ,13200000
AMY BRANDT (CONT'D) The movie shoots in Paris. ,156000
There's no script. ,252000
Revision 73. ,9980
FRANK We want to build the character with you. ,44500000
It's a process. ,25700000
Three-month rehearsal, four-month shoot. ,61900
MIA ...Ok. AMY BRANDT So why don't you just tell us a story? ,5480000
MIA ...About...? ,39200
AMY BRANDT About anything. ,480000
Mia nods again. ,54900
A moment. ,13300000
AMY BRANDT (CONT'D) Whenever you're ready. ,20300
Mia thinks. ,4420
She takes a breath -- then goes silent again. ,263000
It seems she might be unsure what to do, might even be about to choke the audition. ,855000
We fear she may botch this completely... ,11000000
A126 WE CUT TO THE LOBBY -- to Sebastian, hearing Mia's silence. ,67700
On edge... ,6300000
Worried... ,13100000
B126 WE RETURN to the AUDITION ROOM... ,999000
Brandt and Frank waiting... ,966000
MIA My aunt lived in Paris for a bit... ,614000
She used to tell me these stories, when I was growing up, about living abroad... (beat) I remember -- she told me she jumped into the Seine once... ,39600
She pauses, and then continues -- in SONG. [TRACK: AUDITION] Yes, this audition is different than the rest, and the switch to song signals just that. ,27600
Mia's nerves fade away -- all the accents and fakery of earlier auditions a distant memory. ,4490
This is Mia undisguised -- pure and stark and beautiful... ,41400
She uses the story of her aunt jumping into the river to paint a portrait of all the dreamers in the world -- all the people who are told they're nuts for pursuing their passion -- all the so-called "fools" who take the plunge. ,17000
She sings about them and for them. ,7060000
This is why Mia does what she does -- why she simply has no choice... ,3710000
The song ends, and we linger on her for a moment. ,1750000
Then... ,20500000
Revision 74. ...WE DISSOLVE TO: 127 EXT. GRIFFITH PARK - DAY Mia and Sebastian sit on a bench, the Observatory perched behind them. ,967
The clouds have parted, and it's now a gorgeous Los Angeles afternoon, minutes before dusk. ,9970
Sebastian looks at Mia. ,1750000
A moment passes. ,13200000
SEBASTIAN When do you find out? ,144000000
MIA They said the next couple of days... ,3200000
But I'm not expecting to find anything out. ,36600
SEBASTIAN You're going to get it. ,68300000
MIA No, I'm not. ,45500
SEBASTIAN You are. ,27100000
I know these things. ,30100000
A beat. ,9650000
MIA Where are we? ,12900000
Sebastian looks at her. ,3710000
SEBASTIAN Griffith Park. ,561000
MIA I mean -- where are we? ,12700000
SEBASTIAN I know... (beat) I don't know. ,1190000
MIA What do we do? ,19900000
SEBASTIAN I don't think we can do anything. ,45500000
Because when you get this -- MIA If I get this -- Revision 75. ,93100000
SEBASTIAN When you get this -- you've got to give it everything you've got. ,2930000
Beat. ,17700000
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) It's your dream. ,157000
MIA What are you going to do? ,108000000
SEBASTIAN I've got to follow my own plan. ,5530000
Stay here. ,2680000
Get my own thing going. ,130000
You know... ,18000000
A moment. ,13200000
Mia nods. ,1790
Sebastian looks at her again. ,1140000
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) You're going to be in Paris. ,306000
Good jazz there. ,939000
And you love jazz now. ,1700000
Mia smiles. ,207000
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Right? ,62600
MIA Right. ,35500
Another moment. ,283000
And then, finally -- SEBASTIAN I guess we're just going to have to wait and see. ,428000
Mia's eyes well up, just slightly, as she hears this. ,She nods. ,MIA You know I'm always going to love you. ,SEBASTIAN I'm always going to love you too. ,Beat. ,Sebastian looks up at the Observatory. ,SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Look at this view. ,MIA (playfully) I've seen better. ,Revision 76. ,SEBASTIAN Agreed. ,They laugh. ,Then, almost to herself -- MIA I've never been here during the day. ,Sebastian smiles. ,A moment. ,We CUT TO WIDE. Sebastian and Mia sit side by side. ,We linger here, our two characters framed by the white-and-green Observatory, the rest of L.A. stretching out beyond. ,And then, ever so slowly... ...we FADE TO: WINTER A palm tree, a cloudless sky. ,We PULL BACK -- to reveal it's all painted... 128 EXT. STUDIO LOT - DAY We're on a studio lot, looking at one of the old painted backdrops, of a palm tree and sky. ,A new title card: Five years later... ,We TILT down to the studio's entryway. ,A CAR enters. ,A WOMAN steps out. ,We don't see her face. ,We FOLLOW her from behind. ,She walks elegantly, poised. ,The wind picks up a strand of her hair. ,She makes her way down side-streets we've seen before, past Parisian-style façades. ,Then enters a COFFEE SHOP we recognize... 129 INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY The eyes inside all look the WOMAN's way. ,She reaches the counter -- and we finally SEE HER FACE: MIA Hi... ,Iced coffee, please. ,MIA looks different. ,Different haircut, different way of handling herself. ,The BARISTA hurries to get Mia's order. ,We recognize this as the shop where Mia used to work. ,A man who appears to be the NEW MANAGER gives Mia the coffee -- Revision 77. ,NEW MANAGER On us. ,MIA No, no, that's fine. ,Mia hands over a few dollar bills. ,Then drops another bill into the tip jar. ,The Barista smiles. 130 EXT. COFFEE SHOP - MOMENTS LATER Mia exits the coffee shop...and is met by a CREW MEMBER on a GOLF CART. She gets on the cart -- and is driven away... ,CUT TO: CLOSE ON hands on piano keys, fluttering across the ivories. ,We PULL BACK: it's SEBASTIAN. We're in... 131 INT. JAZZ CLUB - DAY ...a small jazz club. ,Simple, tasteful, cool. ,Stone arches in 1940's style. ,The seats close to the band, the piano in the center. ,The club has the same old-school character as the Lighthouse -- but it's not run-down. ,It's polished, inviting. ,The place is empty save for Sebastian and an EMPLOYEE. It's before-hours. ,Sebastian finishes playing. ,Feels out the lowest keys once more, then the highest. ,Then turns and -- SEBASTIAN Alright, I'm done. (gets up) Harris did a nice job with it. ,EMPLOYEE Took him long enough. ,Sebastian smiles. ,SEBASTIAN No one touches the instruments. ,Carson's coming an hour early to test levels. ,EMPLOYEE I got a check for you to sign. ,SEBASTIAN How'd we do last month? ,EMPLOYEE Not too bad. ,Revision 78. ,SEBASTIAN (as he signs the check) Not too bad is great. (taps the Employee on the shoulder) See you tonight. ,EMPLOYEE See you tonight. 132 EXT. CHATEAU MARMONT - DAY Mia pulls into the driveway. 133 INT. ROOM - CHATEAU MARMONT - DAY She steps inside. ,Flowers and cards. ,We glimpse cursive "CONGRATULATIONS" written on a few of them. ,A stack of scripts on a nearby table. ,Her name visible. ,She drops her things, spots someone, goes in to kiss him. ,A long, tender, loving embrace, as we pull back... ...and see that it's not Sebastian. ,It's a MAN we haven't seen before: DAVID, mid-thirties. ,He and Mia kiss again. ,And, running over and grabbing Mia's leg, is a TWO-YEAR-OLD GIRL... 134 INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - EVENING Sebastian steps in. ,The place is more habitable than his old digs. ,Fully furnished, warm and welcoming. ,He heads to the kitchen, pulls out some pork cutlets he's been thawing. ,We see, sitting on the counter, a Christmas card with a photo attached: Laura, Harry, and a FOUR-YEAR-OLD BOY, all gathered on a couch and smiling at the camera. 135 INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - LATER Sebastian eats his meal, in a new shirt and pants. ,Checks his watch. 136 EXT. JAZZ CLUB - DAY Sebastian pulls up outside the club. ,New car, same style. ,Gets out and passes by a movie poster as he walks. ,We can't see the title, but we can catch a glimpse of a face on it. ,It's MIA... 137 INT. JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT We're back in the club. ,Revision 79. ,It's bustling now -- the BARTENDERS setting up, DOORMEN coming in, MUSICIANS sound-checking. ,Sebastian enters, the musicians greet him -- DRUMMER King Seb! SEBASTIAN Hothouse Eddie -- miss me? ,DRUMMER Like the desert misses the rain. ,And then -- we see a SAXOPHONIST we recognize. ,One of the old Lighthouse players. ,SAXOPHONIST Seb -- Edgar's bringing his horn tonight. ,SEBASTIAN Yeah? ,Tell him to tune it, huh? ,SAXOPHONIST That's not Edgar. ,Laughs, pats on the back. 138 INT. ROOM - CHATEAU MARMONT - NIGHT Mia, in a new outfit, crosses the living area and grabs her purse and jacket. ,David is by the door, jacket on as well. ,Mia bends back around a sofa, where the GIRL we saw before is seated next to a nineteen-year-old baby-sitter, CHELSEA. MIA Bye, sweetie. ,You be nice to Chelsea. ,The Girl nods. ,Mia kisses her forehead. ,Heads to the door. ,CHELSEA Bye, Mrs. ,Dolan. 139 OMIT 140 INT. CAR - NIGHT David drives, Mia seated beside him. ,They're on the 101. ,Gridlock traffic up ahead. ,DAVID What if we miss this? ,What do we tell Natalie? ,Revision 80. ,MIA We can just see it back in New York... ,David nods. ,Looks at the time on the car. 8:06. 141 INT. CAR - LATER Mia and David are seated. ,Still not moving. ,Mia looks at the clock again: 8:27. ,MIA (CONT'D) Do you want to just skip it...? ,Turn off here and get dinner? ,David looks at her. ,Smiles. ,DAVID Alright... 142 EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT Mia and David walk down a street. ,A few open restaurants and bars, a few other closed storefronts. ,A lot of old, weathered buildings: 1930's stucco, Art Deco signs. ,Then -- David's ears perk up. ,He hears something. ,MUSIC... ,He looks around. ,Doesn't see the source. ,Heads to the end of the block, then sees, just up ahead, a few people entering a building. ,Seems to be where the music's coming from... ,Mia heads over, curious. ,The music grows louder -- sounds like a JAZZ COMBO. Mia peeks toward the door... ...and then FREEZES. The sign on the door reads: "SEB'S". It's written the way she drew it for Sebastian, years ago... ,Coming up to her side, oblivious -- DAVID (CONT'D) This looks fun. ,David edges past Mia. ,Glimpses the bar inside. ,Turns to her, inviting -- DAVID (CONT'D) Come on... ,Mia doesn't know what to say. ,She follows David... ,Revision 81. 143 INT. JAZZ CLUB - CONTINUOUS Inside, a JAZZ COMBO is tearing through a fast bop chart. ,The seats around the band are almost all occupied. ,Young fans, older couples, passersby trickling in from outside. ,It's an excited crowd, far more varied than what we saw at the Lighthouse -- a real range of ages and styles. ,Mia's eyes drift as David heads to the bar. ,She recognizes the images on the walls -- all Sebastian's. ,Recognizes a stool by the bar -- also Sebastian's, formerly Hoagy Carmichael's... ,DAVID (CONT'D) Mia? ,She turns to David. ,Wavering, unsure what to do, she follows him as he manages to find two empty seats close to the bandstand... ,The combo finishes. ,Hearty applause. ,A young PIANIST rises from the keys, waves "thanks". ,And -- just then -- Sebastian appears. ,Mia looks at him, frozen. ,SEBASTIAN (taking the microphone) Manny Halloran, ladies and gentlemen. (more applause) I don't know, I told him to play "Jingle Bells". ,The crowd laughs. ,Sebastian smiles, looks at them -- -- and sees Mia. ,Shock. ,The two LOCK EYES -- and you can tell it's the first time they've seen each other in years. ,A prolonged silence. ,Sebastian is speechless. ,Then -- forcing himself to keep on a face -- SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Welcome to Seb's. ,More applause. ,Sebastian sits at the piano. ,Looks at the keys. ,He seems uncertain -- perhaps unsure what to play. ,He looks at Mia. ,Takes the sight in. ,Beat. ,Then looks at his fellow musicians. ,Murmurs to them. ,Then turns back to the keys -- -- and finally starts playing. ,Revision 82. ,A quieter tune, just piano, soft and tender and melancholy. ,A melody we -- and Mia -- instantly recognize... ,It's Mia and Sebastian's song. ,Mia looks at Sebastian. ,He looks at her, then back at his keys. ,This is the most beautiful we've ever heard his playing. ,The most tender, and full of emotion, it has ever sounded. ,We MOVE CLOSER on Sebastian. ,We recognize this image. ,It recalls the visualization of his dream, back at the RESTAURANT that night in winter, years ago. ,Gradually, as Sebastian plays, his surroundings seem to grow DARKER. Slowly, subtly at first, with just shifts in lighting, then a shift in perspective, the interior of the club changes, and soon... 144 ...we find ourselves back at that same RESTAURANT... ,Back when Mia laid eyes on Sebastian for the first time... ,Within this fantasy-flashback, Sebastian finishes his piece. ,We stick on Mia, watching him as his Boss talks to him. ,All is as before, as we remember it... ,And sure enough, Mia approaches Sebastian as he walks near her, and -- MIA I just wanted to say -- I saw your playing, and I -- -- but instead of brushing past her -- -- Sebastian decks her with a kiss for the ages. ,A BURST OF ORCHESTRAL MUSIC. The DINERS in the restaurant spin around to face Mia and Sebastian -- and SNAP their fingers in time. ,Even the Boss starts to DANCE. Mia and Sebastian grin -- and then strut out together, hand in hand... [EPILOGUE] 145 INT. NEW APARTMENT - DAY Mia and Sebastian push open a new door -- to their new place. ,It's a shabby one-bedroom -- but it's theirs... 146 INT. LIGHTHOUSE CAFE - NIGHT Next, Keith approaches Sebastian at the Lighthouse -- but Sebastian immediately shakes his head "no". 147 INT. THEATER - NIGHT Sebastian watches Mia perform -- it's the night of her play. ,He stands up to applaud -- and behind him, the entire theater, utterly packed, rises as well. ,A huge standing ovation. ,Mia's ROOMMATES are there, giddy with joy, as are LAURA and HARRY... ,Revision 83. 148 INT. STUDIO SOUNDSTAGE - DAY / NIGHT Mia and Sebastian walk together outside -- but now that we're outside we realize this isn't the real L.A. at all.. ,This, in fact, is an L.A. that doesn't exist. ,A painted- backdrop L.A., just like the one we saw Mia pass by when parking on the lot... ,The old orange groves and the gabled rooftops and the moss- covered bungalows and the ivy-decked lamps, the jacaranda trees and the giant hills and Griffith and the Santa Monica Pier -- all painted, all props, all figments of a studio- backdrop imagination. ,We've entered a fully fantastical realm, the realm of the old Hollywood ballets of the 40's and 50's... ,A148 Everyone DANCES -- the pedestrians and the street performers and the cops and the guards... ,AMY BRANDT races up to Mia -- seems to beckon her to audition... ,We see the audition silhouetted against a wall... ,We don't hear Mia sing, but the music takes on the melody of her song, carrying us to... ,B148 PARIS... ,Sebastian travels there with Mia... ,We chart the journey through an OLD GLOBE -- the same one we saw Mia use for her play -- a miniature plane and dissolves, the old- Hollywood-movie way... ,Finally, we find ourselves looking at a PAINTED BACKDROP of Paris -- the same one Mia used for her play. ,The Sacré-Coeur and the Arc de Triomphe and the Eiffel Tower etched in bright colors, the ornate lampposts and the cobblestones stretching before us... ,And then a sign -- "CAVEAU DE LA HUCHETTE"... ,C148 We see a jam session at the Caveau -- a crypt-like jazz club. ,Sebastian plays, on cloud nine... ,C148pt We see a MOVIE SHOOT, Mia surrounded by lights and cranes, decked in movie-movie glow. ,We're BACK to the Caveau. ,The lights go out -- except for the TRUMPETER, playing out a lovelorn solo, rim-lit. ,We MOVE in close on his horn -- DIVE into the bell -- D148 -- and emerge into NIGHTTIME PARIS. All painted. ,Mia and Sebastian wander through this wonderland, pedestrians frozen around them... ,Finally, they stop and look at one another... ,And -- as the city lights behind them start to glitter like all the stars of the galaxy... ...they DANCE. Revision 84. ,This is the last time we'll ever see them dance, and they seem to recognize that, so graceful and poised are their movements... ,Remember -- this is a romance more perfect than a real romance could ever be... ,We DISSOLVE again -- to a projector beam... 16mm footage plays on a screen, full of scratches and pockets of light... ,Mia and Sebastian sit down to watch together -- and we see the following moments in brief, vivid GLIMPSES, as we move in closer on the imagery: 149 The first home... (16mm) 150 Mia's pregnancy... (16mm) 151 The newborn child... (16mm) 152 The child's first birthday... (16mm) 153 The child's first day of pre-school, all dressed up... (16mm) Everything here glows with the warmth of old home movies... ,These are memories, fluttering by, grabbed at random -- and yet all concocted, dreamed up out of nothing... ,The SCORE continuing to sway and taking us right up to... 154 Sebastian and Mia, husband and wife, father and mother, hiring a babysitter because they've decided to go out for a night at the movies... (We're back to 35mm now.) The look here is unaffected, just everyday. ,The MUSIC quiets slightly, everything goes more natural, as this happily married couple hit the road... 155 ...then find themselves blocked by a traffic jam...then take a side route, winding up in another part of L.A... 156 ...then walk down the street, then hear music -- a jazz combo playing somewhere... 157 ...and step into a place that looks just like Sebastian's club... ,They sit down to listen... ,And then -- and this is how our imagined montage-musical number ends -- the combo's PIANIST, who of course is not Sebastian, launches into Mia and Sebastian's melody... ...and Mia and Sebastian look at each other, recognizing it. ,The music goes full-circle, back to where it started, as Mia and Sebastian look into each other's eyes, lean in and, softly, but with all the love in the world... ...KISS. Revision 85. 158 WE CUT BACK TO THE PIANO: Sebastian has just finished his piece. ,We're back to reality. ,The audience in the club applauds. ,Beat. ,Mia looks at Sebastian. ,Looks away. ,A moment passes. ,DAVID Do you want to stay for another? ,She's silent for a second. ,Then she looks at David. ,We should go. ,He nods. ,They rise from their seats and head for the exit. ,Just as they reach the door, and as David steps out, Mia turns and looks back at Sebastian. ,He looks at her. ,Their eyes lock. ,A hint of a tear in both... ,And, ever so subtly, for just a fleeting second, Mia smiles. ,It's the kind of smile you could miss if you blinked -- but it's enough to signal to Sebastian that she recognized the melody he played, and that she still remembers it, and still thinks of it to this day... ,Then she walks out the door. ,Sebastian glances at his fellow musicians. ,Then, he nods, and they launch into a new chart. 159 EXT. STREET - NIGHT It's silent outside. ,You can't hear the music. ,Mia and David reach their car. ,They get in. ,It pulls out. ,Passing by Sebastian's club, the car continues on. ,We stay put, the jazz club on one side of the frame, the lights of the car on the other. ,Those lights growing smaller and smaller, before finally disappearing into the big L.A. night... ,IRIS FADE OUT. ,
THE END
THE REVENANT Written by Mark L Smith Based on the novel by MICHAEL PUNKE September 26, 2007 Revenge is an act of passion; vengeance of justice. - Samuel Johnson Based on a true story FADE IN: EXT. UPPER MISSOURI RIVER/1820'S - EVENING ANGLE ON A SINGLE COTTONWOOD LEAF... brown and crisp... clinging to its empty branch... the solitary sign of life on an otherwise barren tree. ,A gust of wind... the leaf breaks free... flutters down, landing in the slow current of the Missouri. ,The last leaf of the fall, taking its final journey south. ,As it floats along the surface, rising and falling with the current, all we can hear is the river's gentle movement... the trickle of water... the splash of timid rapids... until DISTANT VOICES invade this world... soft at first, but growing louder... ,LAUGHTER... ,SINGING. And then our leaf CRASHES INTO A WOODEN BOARD... the BOW OF A BOAT. We hear the VOICES EVEN CLEARER... ,MEN'S VOICES, as we rise up the bow... see it's a FLATBOAT BEACHED ON A SANDBAR at the center of the river. ,Beyond the flatboat are the voices... ,TWENTY MEN of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company, making camp along the shore... hauling wood, building campfires, pitching squares of canvas for makeshift rooftops. ,And this camp is full of life because these are some of the first men to ever see this untouched wilderness... men with a whole new world just waiting for them to claim their share. ,EXT. CAMP - EVENING CAPTAIN ANDREW HENRY, (late 20's), dressed in a buckskin jacket with long fringe... thick belt pulled tightly around his waist with two pistols and a knife hanging from it. ,He stands out among the others... like an imposter pretending to be a member of some exclusive club. ,He pulls off one of his gloves... examines the BLOOD-FILLED BLISTERS lining his palm. ,From across the camp, JOHN FITZGERALD, (40's), solid and thick... dark eyes of a killer, watches Henry. ,He nudges MACE BOONE, (40's), a thief in a previous life. ,FITZGERALD Likely got a splinter. ,Can't figure what to do without Mama here to pull it out for him. ,Boone chuckles... spits in Henry's direction. 2. ,BOONE Need a doc, Captain? ,Henry looks up... sees Fitzgerald and Boone grinning at him. ,He slides his glove back on. ,HENRY Gather more wood. ,Fitzgerald waits for Henry to turn, then gives his back an exaggerated salute. ,FITZGERALD (under his breath) Shame my Pap was a broken down drunk. ,Else he could've bought me a Captain's job too. ,Boone snickers. ,Fitzgerald stomps his boot onto a branch, easily snaps it into two easy-to-carry pieces. ,FITZGERALD (CONT'D) We got a plan for these fires, Captain, or are we roastin' berries all the way up to Fort Union? ,HENRY Glass and the others will be back with some game, Fitzgerald. ,Just make sure you have the fires ready. ,FITZGERALD My supper's in the hands of a hermit nigger, a kid and a dummy. ,Hell, my belly feels full already. ,Fitzgerald's boot CRACKS another branch... and when it does, we hear the EXPLOSION OF A GUNSHOT. CUT TO: EXT. WILDERNESS - EVENING And a CLOUD OF SMOKE surrounding the LONG BARREL OF AN ANSTADT RIFLE. The smoke fades, and at the other end of the rifle we see the face of HUGH GLASS, (40's), African-American, one eye still closed, as the other calmly stares down that barrel. ,VOICE (O.S.) Shit fire, you got him, Mr. Glass! 3. ,Glass lowers the rifle, as PIG GILMORE, (30's), fat and filthy, races past. ,PIG (CONT'D) Square as a barn door. ,JIM BRIDGER, (17), young eyes that have already seen a lot, nods to Glass as he follows Pig. ,Glass watches Pig and Bridger trot through the trees to a fallen ELK. Glass walks calmly after them, graceful in this world... his rifle so comfortable in his hand it's like he was born with it there. ,Pig crouches over the dead elk... grins up at Glass. ,PIG (CONT'D) Right where you said he'd be. ,BRIDGER But bigger than we figured. ,Gonna be a load to haul back to camp. ,PIG Have to split it up I reckon. ,GLASS Yep. ,Bridger'll take the tail, and Pig you haul the rest. ,And Fitzgerald was right about Pig being a little slow, because he just nods... pulls out his knife to cut the tail off for Bridger. ,Bridger and Glass exchange a smile... until Glass notices something... steps over the elk, his eyes locked on the ground beside it. ,He runs a finger over the dirt... touches a broken twig. ,BRIDGER Another one close by? ,Glass doesn't answer... studies the track... feels the nearby brush... inhales the scent from his hand. ,Bridger and Pig watch him... exchange a confused glance. ,And then in a flash of movement, Glass is on his feet, racing away. ,PIG Hugh? ,Glass just keeps running. ,Pig and Bridger chase after him. ,CUT TO: 4. ,EXT. CAMP - EVENING The men building fires... laughing... enjoying themselves. ,Boone on the outskirts, gathering branches. ,CUT TO: GLASS - TEARING THROUGH THE WOODS... ...dodging trees... leaping over fallen logs... loading his Anstadt as he runs. ,BRIDGER AND PIG - CHASING AFTER GLASS... ...but not as gracefully. ,Pig trips... slams to the ground... scrambles back to his feet to continue on. ,CUT TO: BOONE - CARRYING AN ARMLOAD OF WOOD INTO CAMP... ...seeing other men playing cards. ,He stops along the edge of camp, drops the wood to the ground. ,BOONE No rule says I'm the only one that's gotta gather this shit. ,The other men don't even notice. ,Then an ARROW WHIZZES THROUGH THE AIR from behind Boone... ,THWACK... it hits him in the back of the neck... erupts out the front of his throat. ,Boone stands frozen... confused... reaches up and grabs the bloody arrow... finally drops to his knees. ,And that's when a TRAPPER looks up... sees Boone on his knees, holding that arrow, his mouth open like a dying fish. ,24200
AND BEYOND BOONE ARE FORTY ARIKARA WARRIORS CHARGING THROUGH THE TREES... ,2090000
FEATHERS RISING FROM THE MOHAWKS SPLITTING THEIR SHAVED HEADS... ,3990
FACES PAINTED FOR BATTLE. TRAPPER `REE! WHOOSH... ,12300
AN ARROW SAILS INTO THE TRAPPER'S CHEST, sending him flying backward. ,15800
The camp explodes into chaos... men YELLING... grabbing for weapons... stumbling over each other as they duck behind trees. 5. ,309
HENRY - PULLING THE PISTOLS FROM HIS BELT... ...taking aim at the attacking figures. ,12200
The Arikara pour into camp, arrows flying... knives and hatchets swinging. ,12300
And this is a massacre... the Arikara wading through the trappers... stabbing... clubbing... scalping. ,67
This once peaceful world is filled with a sickening mix of war cries and screams of death. ,8770
Fitzgerald rises up from behind a log... aims his rifle... ,12000
BOOM... takes down one of the warriors. ,2050000
He starts reloading as ANOTHER WARRIOR charges him... draws back his knife. ,18900
Fitzgerald pours the powder, but knows he isn't going to make it in time... the warrior leaps toward him... ...BOOM... it's like the warrior hits an invisible wall... flies back to the ground, very dead. ,7450
Fitzgerald spins... sees Glass and his Anstadt right behind him. ,38800
GLASS GET TO THE BOAT! Fitzgerald takes off... flips his rifle around, swings it like a club across a warrior's head... ,40500
WHACK! GLASS (CONT'D) (TO HENRY) THE BOAT, CAPTAIN! Henry shoves a TRAPPER toward the water. ,78
An arrow drives into the trapper's leg... he goes down. ,102000
Henry lifts the man to pull him into the river, but several more arrows bury in the man's back... he falls limp. ,1710
Henry FIRES HIS PISTOLS, dropping the WARRIOR. Bridger and Pig join Glass... splash into the river, SHOOTING back at the attacking Arikara. ,966
The water deepens, and they start swimming toward the flatboat. ,5920
ARROWS HISS into the water all around them. ,1740000
Glass is still in the shallows... aims his pistol... ,543000
BAM... shoots an oncoming warrior... spins after the other men... joins them as they near the flatboat. ,10000
A final TRAPPER charges down the shore behind them. ,192000
SEVERAL WARRIORS pursue him. ,395000
TRAPPER WAIT! 6. ,275000
He aims his pistol over his shoulder as he runs... pulls the trigger... ,40900
CLICK... pulls it again... ,7610000
CLICK. But he's too scared to stop his finger... ,4270000
CLICK... ,40800000
CLICK... ,40700000
CLICK... ,40700000
THUD... as a hatchet buries in his back. ,20700
He crashes face first into the shallows. ,45000000
The Arikara leader, (ELK'S TONGUE), animal bones braided into his mohawk, a NECKLACE OF HUMAN EARS around his neck, straddles the dying man. ,94
Elk's Tongue grabs the Trapper by the hair, and CUTS OFF HIS LEFT EAR, then holds it up to Glass and the others, as he SCREAMS HIS WAR CRY. Glass and the men shove the flatboat off the sandbar... start scrambling aboard, as arrows dart past them... drive into the wooden boat. ,62
Suddenly a WARRIOR EXPLODES FROM THE WATER... tackles Bridger as he climbs up the side of the flatboat... jerks him back into the river. ,54
Bridger flails in the water... watches the warrior raise his hatchet high to slam down... just as Glass SLAMS THE BUTT OF HIS ANSTADT into the back of the Warrior's head. ,9
The Warrior collapses under the surface. ,69000
Glass grabs Bridger's hand... drags him up onto the deck. ,568000
BRIDGER Thank you. ,4600000
But Glass is already gone... ,2890000
FIRING BACK AT THE ARIKARA, as the current carries them away. ,1720000
VOICE (O.S.) HEY! Pig looks over the side... sees a frantic WILLIAM ANDERSON gripped to the edge. ,112000
Pig pulls him onto the boat. ,732000
Fitzgerald and Glass grab LONGPOLES... shove them against the river's bottom to pick up speed. ,2770
Henry stands on deck, watching as Elk's Tongue yanks a DYING TRAPPER's head back by his hair to peel away his scalp. ,7120
Henry drops his eyes... can't watch. ,741000
The TRAPPER'S SCREAM ECHOES OVER HIM. EXT. MISSOURI RIVER/FLATBOAT - LATER Quiet and dark... the battle long over. ,8340
The flatboat floats with the gentle current. ,33700
The NINE SURVIVING TRAPPERS are scattered around the deck... 7. ,74700
Glass digging an arrow out of WALLACE MURPHY'S SHOULDER... ,226000
Fitzgerald poling on one side with Anderson on the other... ,94500
STUBBY BILL VANCE and Pig standing patrol with their rifles... ,170000
Bridger doctoring a badly WOUNDED TRAPPER... and Henry standing at the front of the flatboat, staring off blankly. ,1570
FITZGERALD What's the plan, Captain? ,2380000
Henry's still lost in those screams. ,4630000
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) Captain! What the hell do we do now? ,109000
Henry snaps out of his stare... turns to the men... obviously doesn't have an answer. ,117000
ANDERSON We're just floatin' farther from Fort Union. ,87400
Henry's eyes instinctively look to Glass. ,1410000
GLASS The Missouri's no good. ,78100000
Not if the `Ree's running it. ,1770000
FITZGERALD So we just float the hell down to Mexico or wherever else this river takes us? ,243000
GLASS We get ourselves safe outta range, then track another course up. ,184000
FITZGERALD Add weeks to the trip. ,404000
BRIDGER Better that than endin' up scalped on the side of the river. ,12200
FITZGERALD (shoving him away) Shut up, kid, you don't get no say in this. ,705000
Bridger starts to respond, but Fitzgerald's angry glare stops him. 8. ,7960
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) (back to Henry) And in case you hadn't noticed, Captain, we're twelve men short of what we were. (off the badly wounded TRAPPER) Thirteen before long. ,90
HENRY I understand our situation, Mr. Fitzgerald. ,1130000
We do like Glass said... put some distance between us and the Arikara, then chart a course to Fort Union. ,46600
Fitzgerald MUMBLES UNDER HIS BREATH... rolls those dark eyes to Anderson. ,179000
Glass gives Henry a nod. ,110000
EXT. MISSOURI RIVER/FLATBOAT - NIGHT ANGLE ON THE BADLY WOUNDED TRAPPER... ,12200
NOW DEAD... ...as hands push the body over the side of the boat. ,106000
It splashes into the water... floats downstream. ,2870000
We PULL BACK... see that the flatboat is beached along the bank of the river. ,1720000
Glass and Pig watch the body drift away. ,79100000
PIG Reckon it's better `an lettin' the `Ree find him... take his ears... slice what's left all to shit. ,4000
Glass nods... steps down off the boat to Henry and the others. ,375000
They're gathered around a map spread out on the ground. ,3120000
Henry runs his finger along a THIN BLUE LINE. HENRY So we hike west to the Grand, then follow it up to Fort Union. ,1760
FITZGERALD On foot? ,10700000
You got any idea how long that's gonna take? ,24400000
It'll be winter before we get there. ,1400000
ANDERSON Unless we come across a post... trade for some horses. 9. ,522000
GLASS No posts that far out. ,257000
FITZGERALD So if we do this, we do every step with our own feet. ,4490000
HENRY We make camp here for the night, then load supplies and head out for the Grand at first light. (BEAT) And gather extra blankets `cause there won't be any fires. ,112000
More GRUMBLING from Fitzgerald and Anderson, as they move toward the cover of trees. ,210000
Bridger walks up beside Glass. ,2700000
BRIDGER Thank you... for what you done back there. ,22500000
GLASS You'd have done the same for me. ,21100000
Bridger nods... he hopes so. ,93700
EXT. WOODS - NIGHT Pig on watch... sitting at the base of a tree, rifle across his lap, eyes wide, scanning the darkness. ,46800
All clear. ,1330000
He peers back to camp... ,17400000
Fitzgerald, Anderson, Stubby Bill, and Murphy wrapped in blankets... passing a bottle of whiskey around. ,9230
Bridger across from Fitzgerald, poking at the dirt with a stick. ,205000
Henry is off to one side, still studying that map. ,1330000
Glass sits against a tree, cleaning his Anstadt rifle. ,120000
Fitzgerald watches Glass a beat, then... ,124000
FITZGERALD You treat that Anstadt sweeter than any woman, Glass. ,17000
STUBBY BILL Never seen a woman that could stop a `Ree from three hundred feet. ,18300
ANDERSON I knew a particular big-breasted redhead in Boston that might come close. 10. ,14700
The others manage a small laugh. ,93500
Glass just keeps working on that rifle. ,166000
FITZGERALD Bring it over here for me to have a look. ,53200000
Glass doesn't look up... wipes a rag down the barrel. ,152000
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) Did you hear what I said, boy? ,215000
Still nothing from Glass. ,14800000
And Fitzgerald doesn't like that... the tension's growing. ,1120000
BRIDGER (MUMBLING) You seen it before. ,2680
Fitzgerald turns that mean, drunken glare on Bridger. ,13500
FITZGERALD What'd you say, kid? ,54000000
Bridger hesitates a beat... until the other men's eyes force a response. ,179000
BRIDGER (SOFTLY) I said you shoulda already got a look when he saved you with it earlier. ,2450000
The camp falls still... nobody talks to Fitzgerald like that... especially when he's drunk. ,195000
There isn't a sound except for Glass working methodically on his rifle... ...until the SWISH OF BLADE OVER LEATHER, as Fitzgerald tears the blade from his belt... flings it into the dirt between Bridger's legs... ,23
AN INCH BELOW HIS CROTCH. Fitzgerald stares at Bridger, daring him to react. ,14400
But Bridger's too scared... doesn't, so Fitzgerald just smiles. ,35400
FITZGERALD You're lucky you ain't a man yet. (off the blade) Else that mighta nicked somethin'. ,3040
A few NERVOUS CHUCKLES from the others, hoping this is over. ,26700
And it is, because Fitzgerald reaches over and pulls the knife away... cleans the dirty blade on Bridger's leg. 11. ,12800
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) And unlike you, I don't need savin' by him or nobody else. ,7580
Remember that. ,12900000
Fitzgerald stands... wobbles just a bit. ,21800
He slides the knife back into his belt, then steadies his drunken gaze on Glass. ,9210
The others exchange nervous glances... uh-oh. ,323000
Fitzgerald walks to Glass... snaps his fingers for Glass' Anstadt. ,363000
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) Lemme see what's so special `bout that shooter of yours. ,9410
Nothing from Glass, so Fitzgerald grabs the barrel, but Glass holds firm. ,167000
GLASS Middle of workin' on it. ,9590000
FITZGERALD Well you can stop workin' on it, and let me have a look like I said. ,1510000
Fitzgerald gives another tug, but Glass' grip only grows tighter. ,14500
His eyes roll up to Fitzgerald... make it clear he isn't giving up his rifle. ,28600
And they hold that stare just as hard as they're holding Glass' rifle. ,149000
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) You forget your place? ,37900000
GLASS Best I can tell, my place is right where I want it... on the smart end of my rifle. ,135000
Fitzgerald realizes the barrel he's holding is aimed right at his stomach, while Glass' hand seems suddenly very close to the trigger. ,10600
But Fitzgerald's pride and that whiskey won't let him lose this tug of war. ,52300
FITZGERALD I'd be careful if I was you, boy. ,4200000
And this thing's about to turn real ugly... until... ,3030000
HENRY That's enough, Fitzgerald. ,5590000
Go sober up and get to sleep. (MORE) 12. ,14800000
HENRY(CONT'D) If you're passed out when we break camp tomorrow, I leave you here. ,13900
Fitzgerald holds his glare on Glass, then releases the rifle, shoving it back at Glass. ,12400
He glances to Henry, and throws back a big gulp from the bottle just for spite, before backing away from Glass. ,3270
FITZGERALD That's the trouble with this part of the world. ,581000
No mirrors. ,199000
Niggers forget what color they are. ,70300
Glass ignores Fitzgerald... goes back to his rifle. ,82000
Fitzgerald tosses the bottle at Anderson, then jerks his blanket up... walks off to sleep by himself. ,11800
Glass glances up from his work... just long enough to give Bridger a nod. ,17200
EXT. CAMP - LATER Fitzgerald sleeping off that whiskey. ,135000
The others snoring in a cluster at the center of the camp. ,138000
Henry lies there awake... looks across to Glass, still sitting against the tree, a HANDRAWN MAP in his lap, as his eyes pierce the darkness. ,3360
Henry eases over to Glass. ,628000
HENRY Can't sleep either? ,880000
GLASS Never like closin' my eyes when I'm not sure who'll be standin' over me when I open `em. ,7020
HENRY I keep thinking about Boone and the others... how maybe I should've had us make camp further up river. ,192000
GLASS The tracks I saw... those `Ree had been tailin' us for a while. ,1720
They'd have gone as far north as it took. (BEAT) You're a good man, Captain. ,371000
Soon as you realize that, these others will too. ,32000000
Henry likes hearing that... still isn't sure it's true. 13. ,1330000
HENRY Your years trappin' and guidin' out here... have you had much experience with the Arikara? ,18
GLASS Enough to try and stay outta their way. ,2870000
HENRY (motions to Glass' map) But you know this country well enough to get us past them... up to Fort Union? ,1190000
GLASS I been here a long while. ,115000
Whether that gets us to Union or not... ,7910000
Henry waits for more... doesn't get it. ,6100000
So he just nods and starts back to his blanket.... stops. ,342000
HENRY What Fitzgerald said earlier... he doesn't speak for the rest. ,1750000
GLASS He wasn't wrong. ,2810000
Truth is that's what I prefer about this country... it's got no eye for the color of a man's skin. ,942000
HENRY (BEAT) Try to get some sleep, Hugh. ,3700000
Henry climbs back under his blanket. ,739000
Glass just sits there looking at the map. ,30800000
ANGLE ON GLASS' MAP... ...primitive at best. ,641000
Sketched mountains... winding blue lines for rivers... small dots are scattered about with names beside them... "Brazeau", "Talbot", "Union". ,210000
And DOZENS OF TRIANGLE PINE TREES have been drawn, representing the endless wilderness. ,23000
We TIGHTEN ON THOSE TRIANGLES until we're lost in them. ,1940000
DISSOLVE TO: 14. ,9200000
EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY Thick with trees. ,681000
Henry leads the men single file through the woods. ,184000
They each have a canvas sack of supplies over one shoulder, and their rifle in their hands. ,73400
The only sound is their feet crunching the dried leaves, and even that seems too loud as their eyes dart about, searching for any sign of attack. ,4940
STUBBY BILL Shouldn't we have hit the Grand by now? ,1640000
HENRY We'll reach it soon enough. ,1800000
Glass said to keep this course. ,15800000
FITZGERALD Glass said. ,109000
Too bad I don't see him. ,78100000
PIG That's on account he's up ahead makin' sure it's clear, and you get to keep your ears. ,12000
Fitzgerald throws Pig an angry glance. ,10200
FITZGERALD Or he's run off and left us. ,4030000
BRIDGER He wouldn't do that. ,190000
Fitzgerald GRUNTS... doesn't believe that. ,12300
FITZGERALD My bet, that nigger's used to runnin'. ,63400
EXT. WOODS - DAY Glass moves slowly through the brush, almost gliding... subtle twists and turns to avoid branches and leaves... careful not to leave his scent behind. ,8990
And his eyes cut through the trees as he moves... digging for any sign of movement. ,310000
He spots something at his feet... crouches down, running his finger over the SMALL ANIMAL TRACK in the dirt. 15. ,74500
O.S. ,15700000
RUSTLING snaps his head up... to the TREMBLING OF BUSHES... growing harder... whatever's in there is coming toward Glass. ,11800
He calmly raises his rifle... presses the stock firmly against his shoulder... closes one eye as he takes steady aim down the long barrel... ...to the shapes rumbling out of the brush... ,697
TWO BEAR CUBS playfully wrestling. ,153000
Glass lowers the Anstadt... looks past the cubs for something else... but the woods are empty. ,37000
A SUDDEN FEAR FILLS GLASS' EYES... ...he spins... right into the GIANT GRIZZLY SWINGING ITS PAW AT HIM... hitting him across the side of the neck. ,1550
The animal's razor claws tear into Glass' throat, as the force sends him flying through the air. ,8900
Glass sails into a thick tree... the CRACK OF HIS LEG SNAPPING against the trunk. ,15500
The rifle falls from his hand. ,463000
The Grizzly lets out a massive ROAR... charges Glass. ,24000
Glass crawls to the Anstadt... grabs it... has just enough time to tilt the rifle toward the bear... ,5780
BOOM. CUT TO: HENRY - HEARING THE BLAST. HENRY UP AHEAD! Henry takes off at full sprint. ,969000
The other men follow. ,60700000
CUT TO: GLASS - AS THE BEAR LEAPS ON TOP OF HIM... ...tosses Glass aside with a powerful swing. ,476000
Glass hits the ground with a PAINFUL THUD. He starts CRAWLING AWAY, pulling the KNIFE from his belt as the bear rises up like a giant behind him... swings... tears its claws across Glass's back, shredding deep into his flesh. ,13
Glass is fighting for his life now... flailing with the knife... slicing it across the bear's paw as it whips past him. ,12100
The wound slows the bear enough for Glass to start crawling again. ,261000
But the Grizzly doesn't give Glass the chance... ,870000
ROARS... is on him in a flash, a BLUR OF CLAWS AND FANGS... tearing across Glass' head... ripping into his face... his chest. 16. ,12100
Glass drives his knife into the bear again... deep... trying to tear through the layers of flesh to something more vital. ,2350
CUT TO: HENRY - LEADING THE CHARGE THROUGH THE FOREST. CUT TO: GLASS AND THE GRIZZLY - FIGHTING THIS EPIC BATTLE... ...locked in a death grip... tumbling along the ground... trading violent blows... ,382
Glass' blade versus the Grizzly's claws and fangs... snapping small trees as they roll over them... toward the edge of a steep embankment... ... and ROLL DOWN... spinning over and over... each ROARING AT THE OTHER... ,1490
Glass pounding the knife into the bear again and again as they fall... neither willing to surrender as they careen down the slope at a dizzying pace, then SLAM TO THE BOTTOM WITH A CRUNCH. And the forest falls still... ,94
Glass hidden somewhere beneath the massive animal... both deathly motionless. ,46400
EXT. WOODS - DAY Bridger's the first to reach the battleground... sees the TWO FRIGHTENED BEAR CUBS SCURRY AWAY. He follows the bloody ground and crushed underbrush to the top of the slope... looks down to the mass of flesh at the bottom. ,29
BRIDGER Christ Almighty. ,257000
Henry, Pig, and the others reach the edge. ,62300
HENRY Glass! No answer. ,2
And all they can see is the bear, so they scan the trees. ,112000000
PIG HUGH! Still nothing. ,43600
So Bridger takes off down the slope... losing his balance but rolling back to his feet. ,84100
He reaches the bear... sees GLASS' MANGLED ARM STICKING OUT FROM BENEATH IT. 17. ,16500
BRIDGER He's down here! Bridger uses all his strength to push the bear off, as the other men scramble down. ,78400
But Bridger can't budge the massive carcass... not until Stubby Bill and Pig join in... shove the animal over, revealing the bloody mass that is Hugh Glass... ...his throat is torn wide open... scalp peeled back from just above his eyebrows, hanging off the skull... stomach and chest a gruesome design of gashes and cuts. ,15
His right leg is snapped, the jagged bone jutting out through the skin. ,34400
Bridger's legs give out... he drops to a knee and vomits. ,357000
MURPHY Oh, Jesus. ,4880000
STUBBY BILL He's tore to pieces. ,3660000
The men stare down at Glass' corpse. ,638000
ANDERSON Least he took that Grizz down with him. ,2460000
FITZGERALD Wished he'da done it without firing his rifle. ,280000
If there wasn't no `Ree around before, there will be now. ,5060000
And that's all Pig can stand... he TACKLES FITZGERALD... they roll to the ground. ,9620000
And in a flash Fitzgerald is on top, raining punches down on Pig... turning his face into a bloody mess. ,34800
Henry and Anderson grab Fitzgerald... drag him off. ,360000
HENRY THAT'S ENOUGH! Then somehow, GLASS GASPS... this horrible, GUTTURAL MOAN. BRIDGER Holy Christ, he's alive. ,1580
Henry and Bridger fall to their knees beside Glass. ,318000
Glass looks up at the men, tries to focus through the blood and pain. ,662000
His breathing is just a GURGLING WHEEZE... bubbles forming along the deep gashes in his throat with each gasp. 18. ,6970
HENRY Get me some water. ,33400000
Stubby Bill tosses Henry his canteen. ,12100
Henry empties it over Glass' throat... his face and scalp. ,13900
The water hits the wounds and immediately transforms to blood. ,244000
BRIDGER Oh, Jesus... ,1580000
Jesus. ,17600000
Glass lifts a trembling hand to his throat... feels the gaping wound. ,22200
His eyes widen in horror. ,121000
He COUGHS... the air splashes blood up from the open wounds in his throat. ,35600
HENRY It's okay, Hugh. (pushing Glass' hand away) You're going to be fine. ,79300
Henry spins his head away from Glass. ,4150000
HENRY (CONT'D) (WHISPERS) I need some rags before he bleeds out. ,1230
Pig whips a shirt from his bag... shreds it. ,116000
HENRY (CONT'D) And your whiskey. ,342000
Pig tosses a bottle to Henry. ,19400
Henry pours it over the gashes. ,342000
The BURNING PAIN arches Glass... he CRIES OUT in that same horrific moan. ,46900
HENRY (CONT'D) Hold him down, Bridger, goddammit. ,131000
Bridger throws his weight against Glass' shoulders. ,414000
HENRY (CONT'D) The rest of you spread out... scout a circle around us. ,239000
Fitzgerald, you and Anderson take west and north. ,30200000
Murphy and Mike south and east. ,192000
Watch for anyone that might've heard that shot. ,11600000
And for the first time, Henry seems like a leader of men... firm... in complete control... just as Glass said he would be. ,189000
So the men hurry off to their positions. 19. ,14200000
PIG What about me, Cap? ,38100000
HENRY Get down here and help me tie off these wounds best we can. ,775000
Pig shakily joins Henry in wrapping the wounds. ,7880
The blood keeps seeping out, soaking the rags. ,25300
PIG It won't stop bleedin'. ,645000
HENRY Shut up, Pig. (TO GLASS) We're fixing you up, Hugh. ,138000
Glass is like a shredded rag doll... dazed eyes staring up at them as they work on his wounds... wrapping the rags around his throat... laying his scalp back over his skull, and tying another rag around it and under his jaw to hold it in place. ,584
Bridger wipes the blood from Glass' face. ,43
BRIDGER It's gonna be fine, Mr. Glass. ,1050000
Henry glances down to the PUDDLE OF BLOOD spilling out over his knees... oozing out from beneath Glass. ,12200
HENRY Roll him over... easy. ,4060000
They gently push Glass onto one side, revealing DEEP, JAGGED, GASHES running across the width of Glass' back. ,3010
Henry stares at the open flesh, ready to panic again... but he doesn't. ,90100
Instead he looks to Pig. ,2140000
HENRY (CONT'D) Get me the kit. ,53100000
We need to stitch his back up. ,102000000
BRIDGER What about the rest of him? ,2720000
HENRY He's losing more blood back here. (off the throat) And I don't know what to do with that yet. 20. ,136000
Pig digs out a thick needle and spool of black thread... hands it to Henry. ,395000
Henry grabs the whiskey bottle. ,12400
HENRY (CONT'D) I'm sorry for how this is about to burn, Hugh. ,184000
Henry pours the whiskey over Glass' back. ,379000
And the pain must be excruciating, because Glass lets out a HORRIBLE WAIL. CUT TO: EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS Fitzgerald and Anderson standing watch together in the trees. ,5250
Glass' scream erupts through the trees, and they both immediately crouch down to a knee... out of sight to anyone out there that might have heard that. ,2280
ANDERSON They're torturin' the poor bastard. ,322000
FITZGERALD And riskin' gettin' us killed in the process. ,78400
Proper thing would be to end it for him quick. ,3750000
ANDERSON `Less he could pull through. ,3850000
FITZGERALD You seen what that grizz did to him. ,684000
Shit, Glass'll be dead inside a hour. ,99500
We all will be if he keeps screamin' like that. ,6580000
EXT. WOODS - LATER SERIES OF SHOTS HENRY, BRIDGER AND PIG WORKING OVER GLASS... ,273000
Bridger and Pig pressing Glass' scalp down, as Henry slides the needle and thread through the skin, suturing the wound. ,7270
HENRY CLEANING GLASS' SHREDDED THROAT. BRIDGER AND PIG HOLDING THE SCREAMING GLASS DOWN AS HENRY SNAPS GLASS' LEG BACK IN PLACE. 21. ,14800
FITZGERALD PEERING BACK THROUGH THE TREES... to Henry doctoring Glass. ,83300
Fitzgerald shakes his head in anger... turns back to the darkening forest. ,137000
EXT. WOODS - EVENING Glass rests unconscious on the ground. ,6880
Two branches act as a splint on his leg. ,3040000
A blanket covers his body... his face is like a swollen, disfigured, Frankenstein's monster... stitches of black thread holding it in place. ,6220
Henry crouches a short distance away from him, rinsing his hands under a canteen. ,8220
Bridger and Pig stand beside him. ,27600
BRIDGER What now? ,4580000
HENRY We wait. ,6590000
Does he have any kin you know of? ,85800000
PIG He keeps to hisself. ,1020000
Never mentioned none. ,11000000
HENRY Go get the others. ,22600000
Tell `em we're making camp here for the night. ,153000
Pig starts hustling away. ,80700
HENRY (CONT'D) And gather some wood, but make sure it's dry. ,125000
We don't want much smoke when we cook that grizzly. ,7160000
ANGLE ON THE MASSIVE BEAR... ...lying dead on the ground, its claws and fangs soaked with blood... ,61900
Glass' blood. ,17500
DISSOLVE TO: EXT. WOODS - NIGHT And what's left of the grizzly... its fur cut away... slabs of flesh butchered from its skeleton. ,1900
A fire burns at the center of camp... a chunk of meat roasts above the flame. ,252000
The men sit around the fire... 22. ,361000
Murphy reaches up... tears a strip of meat from the roast, tossing it in his mouth. ,33100
The men are silent... the pall of Glass' attack still hanging over them. ,1660000
Bridger rises... walks to the Grizzly... crouches down over it, grabbing the animal's enormous paw. ,3040
It dwarfs his own hand, as he examines the claws. ,13400
Bridger pulls out his knife... stretches the claw out to its full length, and CUTS IT OFF AT ITS BASE. FITZGERALD (O.S.) What makes you think you earned a claw? ,2900
Bridger turns with a start... sees Fitzgerald standing over him, meat in his hand... his lips shiny with the grease. ,11300
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) You didn't take that grizz down. ,162000
BRIDGER It ain't for me. ,2960000
Bridger stands... walks over to the sleeping Glass. ,217000
Pig's already crouched beside him. ,286000
Bridger lifts Glass' small leather POSSIBLES BAG from beside the Anstadt rifle... drops the claw inside... throws a look back to Fitzgerald. ,12
Pig holds his palm out just above Glass' mouth. ,108000
PIG I can feel some air outta his mouth. ,27900000
Maybe Captain sealed up his throat proper, huh? (off Bridger's silence) Whatta you figure his odds are, Jim? ,1390
Bridger stares down at what's left of Glass. ,924000
BRIDGER Long. ,2980
EXT. WILDERNESS - MORNING The sun peeks over the horizon, sending an orange glow across the treetops. ,635
EXT. CAMP - MORNING ANGLE ON GLASS... 23. ...unconscious but alive... his raspy breaths are weak and staggered. ,12200
The SHADOWS OF MEN hover over him... ...because Henry and the others surround Glass, staring down at him. ,360000
MURPHY What that bear did to him... ,2960000
I didn't expect he'd last this long. ,1460000
ANDERSON I seen a fella go a week once after a lion jumped him. ,209000
Fever finally finished him off. ,534000
STUBBY BILL Whatta we do, Cap? ,1110000
A long beat, then... ,23400000
HENRY We give him his chance. ,911000
Henry turns and walks away. ,1640000
EXT. CAMP - NIGHT The fire has burned down to nothing. ,311000
The men sleep scattered about. ,562000
Murphy stands just outside of camp, rifle ready, keeping watch. ,1460000
Glass lies there awake... eyes wide open... a living corpse. ,198000
And his breathing is just as labored as before... raspy, blood-soaked strains. ,40400
Fitzgerald tosses and turns, listening to Glass' gurgling. ,21300
FITZGERALD You ain't doin' him or us no favors, Captain, lettin' him suffer that way. ,3290
Henry's awake, but doesn't answer. ,339000
He's holding his pistol in his hand, as he stares at Glass... thinking the same thing Fitzgerald just said. ,3660
But he doesn't move... not yet. ,18200000
Fitzgerald angrily wraps a blanket around his head, muffling the sound. ,12600
Bridger sits beyond him... smiles at Fitzgerald's misery, as he attaches the BEAR CLAW TO A THIN LEATHER STRAP... a necklace. 24. ,1050
EXT. CAMP - MORNING Bridger kneels over a SHIVERING GLASS, holding wet rags on his head. ,12000
Pig and Henry stand over them, watching. ,480000
Fitzgerald, Anderson, Murphy and Stubby Bill sit huddled across camp. ,12200
ANDERSON Fever's hit. ,1680000
Won't be long now. ,79900000
FITZGERALD I seen a bad one drag on days. ,1600000
ANGLE ON GLASS... ...eyes open... he can hear every word. ,3890000
FITZGERALD (O.S.) (cont'd) Insides shut down... flesh starts to spoil and turn. ,1330
Ain't no way for... ,3710000
HENRY (O.S.) Quiet, Fitzgerald. ,757000
FITZGERALD... ...points a stick at Glass. ,305000
FITZGERALD (TO HENRY) We keep sittin' here watchin' him die, only gives the `Ree more chance to find us. ,37000
Henry doesn't answer... just keeps staring down at Glass. ,66600
BRIDGER He's burnin', Cap. ,213000
Water turns to boil as soon as it touches him. ,736000
Henry considers this, then... ,620000
HENRY Pig, take Anderson and scout ahead. ,714000
Grand should be just west of here. ,2
Find us the best route. ,51600000
FITZGERALD Tryin' to buy Glass time don't make sense for the rest of us, Captain. 25. ,152000
HENRY (TO PIG) Get movin'. ,174000
Pig nods... grabs his gear. ,12200
He and Anderson take off out of camp. ,150000
Henry turns... walks over to Fitzgerald and Stubby Bill. ,8340000
HENRY (CONT'D) (WHISPERS) You two can start digging a grave. ,74300
Fitzgerald tosses the stick away. ,12700
FITZGERALD Least it's a step in the right direction. ,28200
EXT. CAMP - LATER Fitzgerald is covered in dirt and sweat, standing knee deep in Glass' grave. ,135000
Stubby Bill stands over him. ,429000
FITZGERALD Any coyote digs that deep deserves the meal. ,46900
He takes Stubby Bill's hand... pulls himself out. ,15000000
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) Glass won't know the difference no ways. ,277000
Pig and Anderson walk back into camp. ,31600000
PIG Found it, Cap. ,8880000
Right where Glass had us headed. ,3480000
ANDERSON No more than a mile or so out. ,Henry looks to Bridger, still doctoring Glass. ,75800
HENRY We could build a litter. ,951000
Haul him with us. ,1860000
ANDERSON It's rocky and steep goin'. ,4160000
Henry looks to Pig for an honest answer. 26. ,173000
PIG Marshy and thick on the other side. ,107000
We could try it, but... ,1060000
Pig shakes his head. ,368000
FITZGERALD I signed on as a trapper, not a goddamn mule. ,32200
BRIDGER (TO HENRY) Shape he's in... ,14900000
I don't see no way he'd make bein' drug. ,3200000
Henry nods, his mind racing for a solution. ,156000
And before long, his hand is back on that pistol. ,41700000
He pulls it from his belt. ,3790000
The other men all drop their heads... except for Fitzgerald... he's ready to see this end. ,9050000
Henry stares down at Glass. ,263000
HENRY Lay that rag over his eyes, Mr. Bridger. ,481000
BRIDGER But, Captain. ,9650000
HENRY Do it. ,9030000
Bridger hesitates, then reaches to fold the wet rag down over Glass' wide open eyes. ,1980
And Glass must know what's happening, because his eyes roll up to Bridger's... his lips try to form a word... his hand digs its fingers into the dirt beside him. ,1070
CUT TO: GLASS' POV - ON BRIDGER... ...the boy looking away as he pulls the rag over our eyes... everything goes black. ,9620
HENRY (O.S.) Step clear, Mr. Bridger. ,11400000
A LONG BEAT in the dark, waiting for that gunshot, then... ,15900000
BACK TO SCENE 27. ,9900000
Henry standing over Glass... pistol aimed down. ,1240000
His hand trembles slightly. ,424000
Pig turns away... presses his hands over his ears. ,174000
Bridger takes a few steps back... stares at Henry. ,2360
Henry struggles to steady his aim, until finally it calms... because he's thought of something else. ,233000
HENRY (CONT'D) There's a seventy dollar bonus from the Rocky Mountain Fur Company to the two men that stay with Glass... see this through. ,26100
Then give him a proper burial. ,428000
BRIDGER I'll stay with him... money or not. ,29200
PIG Same here. ,12500000
HENRY I can't let you stay back, Pig. ,1600000
Without Glass, I'll need you to scout. ,334000
Henry looks to the others... they all drop their eyes... not interested. ,813000
HENRY (CONT'D) Just need one more. ,116000
FITZGERALD Two won't stand much chance against a party of `Ree, Captain, and seventy dollars won't buy me a new setta ears. ,8470
HENRY A hundred then. ,2820000
Still nothing from the others. ,30300000
BRIDGER They can have my share too. ,14700000
I owe Glass that at least. ,971000
FITZGERALD That case I'll hang back with the kid. ,2930000
I don't mind fallin' a day or so behind for two hundred. 28. ,709000
HENRY But Glass is to be cared for until. ,872000
Understood? ,13200000
FITZGERALD (motions to Bridger) I'll let the young doctor do his job. ,205000
Henry hesitates... doesn't like this, but knows it's the best option left. ,248000
HENRY The rest gather your gear. ,36600
Bridger reaches down... lifts the rag from Glass' face. ,23
Their eyes meet... ,13800000
Bridger gives Glass a nod. ,243000
EXT. CAMP - LATER Henry and the others are loaded and ready to leave. ,508000
Pig bends down over Glass. ,191000
PIG I'll see ya at Fort Union, Hugh. ,289000
Glass's glazed eyes focus on Pig. ,248000
He moves the only thing he can... ,78700000
BLINKS a "yes" back at him. ,5830000
HENRY (to Fitzgerald and BRIDGER) As long as necessary. ,14700000
BRIDGER I'll look after him. ,22500000
Henry turns... leads the men into the trees... toward the Grand... toward Fort Union. ,32200
EXT. CAMP - NIGHT What's left of a small fire is nothing but smoldering ash. ,1000000
Bridger crouches beside Glass, pouring a thin stream of broth between his lips. ,32000
Fitzgerald reaches in... grabs Glass' Anstadt leaning against the tree. ,17100
FITZGERALD I'll take first watch. 29. ,387000
BRIDGER Not with his rifle. ,2700000
FITZGERALD Trust me, kid, he ain't gonna be needin' it tonight. ,10400
Fitzgerald disappears into the trees. ,5470
EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY Pig stands on a ridge, scouting a course. ,84600
He waves back to Henry and the others. ,1040000
They start toward him. ,125000
EXT. CAMP - EVENING Glass conscious on the ground... that same labored breathing. ,94800
CUT TO: GLASS' POV - ON FITZGERALD... ...smiling down at Glass as he grabs the Anstadt, holds it... runs his hand down the barrel, as comfortable as if it were his own. ,47000
FITZGERALD You were right to protect this. ,26900
Then he disappears... and we're left alone, staring up at the branches above us... the evening sky... accompanied by Glass' deathly breaths. ,6090
DISSOLVE TO: EXT. WILDERNESS/CREEK - DAY Bridger kneels beside the stream, filling canteens. ,1750
EXT. CAMP - DAY Fitzgerald sits bored against a tree, twisting a knife in his hands... flipping it point first into the dirt... grabbing... repeating... twist... flip... thwack. ,419
And as he does, his eyes are locked on Glass. 30. ,1550000
Finally, Fitzgerald snaps the knife from the dirt, stands, and walks over to Glass. ,24500
Glass is asleep. ,11100000
Fitzgerald crouches down over him... eyes his red, infected wounds. ,63000
FITZGERALD (WHISPERS) When are you gonna die, boy? ,2820000
Fitzgerald reaches out with the blade... gently touches one of the threads holding Glass' throat together. ,9760
And when he does, GLASS' EYES FLY OPEN... focus on Fitzgerald. ,1300000
Fitzgerald doesn't even flinch... just holds that knife tip there against Glass' throat. ,20700
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) I'm nearly a week behind Henry's bunch on accounta havin' to tend to you. ,18300
Be easier on us all if you'd take that last breath. ,56800000
The two men hold a stare... until Fitzgerald pulls back the knife... grabs a bloodstained rag from beside them... balls it up in his fist. ,1520
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) I could help ya with that if you'd like. ,128000
Muzzle ya right now... end all this sufferin' quick and easy. ,11700
Nobody'd ever know you give up. ,32600000
Fitzgerald moves the rag over Glass' nose and mouth... holds it there, just inches above. ,30200
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) You just gimme a blink if you want me to do it. ,54200
Glass locks his eyes on Fitzgerald's... both men unblinking. ,29700
A DROP OF BLOOD hangs from the rag... finally falls... lands on Glass' lips. ,18700
Fitzgerald almost smiles, waiting for the inevitable... as Glass stares back, fighting the urge to blink. ,10200
Suddenly Bridger's hand clamps down on Fitzgerald's shoulder. ,180000
Fitzgerald spins... startled. ,32200
BRIDGER (O.S.) What's goin' on? 31. ,4030000
Fitzgerald jumps with a start, sees it's Bridger, and is pissed that Bridger scared him... and interrupted his business. ,1620
He rises quickly, planting his meaty hand in Bridger's chest, and SLAMMING HIM BACK AGAINST A TREE. FITZGERALD Don't you ever question me, you little piss-ant. ,1230
Bridger tries to fight back, but Fitzgerald's too strong... holds him pressed against the tree... slams a heavy elbow into Bridger's mouth, splitting his lip. ,55
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) I'd just as soon leave both you and your nigger here to rot. `Cept killin' you ain't worth givin' up your share. (LEANS CLOSER) But that don't mean I can't be coaxed into changin' my mind. ,Fitzgerald shoves him away... ,5360000
Bridger stumbles and falls. ,2700000
Fitzgerald tosses the bloody rag at him. ,12500
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) And I was just doin' your job... cleanin' him up. ,125000
Fitzgerald grabs Glass' Anstadt, almost daring Bridger to say something. ,2930
Of course Bridger doesn't. ,416000
Fitzgerald walks toward the trees. ,428000
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) Why don't ya pour some more broth down his throat... keep him alive another week so we can fall farther back. ,624
End up walkin' all the way to Fort Union on our own. `Ree would love to poach on just two. (turns to Bridger) I promise ya, you'll look a helluva lot worse than Glass when they're done with you. ,2
Bridger watches him disappear into the trees... wipes the blood from his lip with a trembling hand. ,3110
DISSOLVE TO: 32. ,15200000
EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT From high above the trees. ,182000
The world is silent... peaceful... until SEVERAL STARTLED CROWS shoot up from the treetops. ,12400
CUT TO: BLACK... ...the sound of FRENZIED BREATHING. FITZGERALD (V.O.) (PANICKED WHISPER) Bridger! Get your ass up! Dim light fills the frame... then FITZGERALD'S FACE right in front of us. ,28
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) `Ree. ,202000
BRIDGER - SCRAMBLES UP FROM UNDER HIS BLANKET, WIPING THE SLEEP FROM HIS FRIGHTENED EYES. BRIDGER What? ,700
FITZGERALD Keep quiet. ,189000
I was down at the creek... there's twenty of `em at least, comin' this way. ,39300
BRIDGER Oh, shit. ,947000
Whatta we do? ,17800000
FITZGERALD We run. ,57100000
Now. ,38300000
And Fitzgerald's just whispering, but it's with such power that Bridger has no response... watches as Fitzgerald gathers his bag, starts throwing in food and supplies. ,4400
Bridger is scared out of his mind... does the same... grabs for his rifle, resting near Glass. ,12200
Bridger freezes... in his panic, he'd forgotten all about Glass. ,98500
And now the wounded man's eyes stare up at him... understanding perfectly what's happening around him. ,7790
BRIDGER What about Glass? 33. ,2360000
FITZGERALD He's on his own, same as us. ,1460000
BRIDGER I can't leave him. ,227000
FITZGERALD Then I'm talkin' to a dead man. ,122000
Glass gives Bridger the slightest of nods... go. ,15900
But Bridger's frozen... doesn't know what to do... until Fitzgerald shoves him back to life. ,88300
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) Move. ,56100
Glass reaches out a weak hand out for his Anstadt... clawing for his weapon. ,12300
Bridger starts to hand it to Glass, but Fitzgerald grabs it first. ,276000
BRIDGER What're you doin'? ,29500
He needs that. ,21900000
FITZGERALD He couldn't hold it if you tarred it to his hands. ,3480000
Glass strains to hold out his trembling hand for his gun. ,74400
BRIDGER It's his goddamn rifle! That's all he's got! FITZGERALD And more than he'll need. ,120000
Fitzgerald scoops up Glass' knife as well. ,2450000
BRIDGER We can't leave him with nothin'. ,1430000
But Fitzgerald is already sprinting away... disappearing into the trees. ,3390
Glass stares after him, his once-calm eyes suddenly filled with a rage. ,27800
And Bridger's frozen again, lost between duty and fear... until finally, he just shakes his head and takes off into the trees. ,262000
Glass's empty hand falls back to the ground... he tries to yell out in anger, but his throat EXPLODES IN PAIN. His hand digs into the dirt... pulls him over onto his side. ,1650
He flops over to his stomach... ,1470000
GASPS IN PAIN... 34. then using his one good arm, drags himself over the dirt, his healthy leg pushing weakly at the ground, trying to propel him forward... a futile chase after Fitzgerald and Bridger... ...inch by inch... farther than he's been in days. ,66
But it's still only a few yards, and now he lies in the open... a clear target for the Arikara. ,21400
Then he spots that hole... the grave Fitzgerald dug for him. ,238000
He grunts into action... grabs SEVERAL, THIN BROKEN BRANCHES from the ground, then claws forward, each movement excruciating... until finally, he reaches the hole, and ROLLS INTO IT... lands with a PAINFUL CRUNCH. He rests there a moment, trying to regain any ounce of strength. ,619
Finally he fights through the pain... shoves the branches back up... spreading them across the hole as camouflage... a thin veil, but all that Glass has. ,12600
He lies there defenseless... ,115000
INSIDE HIS OWN GRAVE. Hiding... listening for the Arikara's arrival... waiting to die. ,2990000
CUT TO: GLASS' POV - OUT OF THE GRAVE... ,70200
TIGHT AND CLAUSTROPHOBIC... ,14000000
JUST THE NIGHT SKY THROUGH THOSE BRANCHES... ,8330000
AND THE SOUND OF HIS PAINFUL BREATHS. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. WILDERNESS - MORNING Cold and grey. ,2450
Fitzgerald crouches beside a small fire, warming his hands. ,259000
WHISPS OF SMOKE rise into the sky. ,171000
FITZGERALD We ran the better part of six hours. ,237000
Had to gain some ground on Henry and them others. ,6060000
Bridger sits at the base of a tree, not listening... staring... his mind replaying the desertion of Glass over and over. ,4000
He notices the smoke. ,7560000
BRIDGER Best douse that smoke before them `Ree spot it. ,142000
FITZGERALD We put enough distance between us and them. ,50500000
And it's too damn cold to go without one. 35. ,6340000
BRIDGER All we know, they hoofed it through the night same as us. ,54100
FITZGERALD (shakes his head) A dozen `Ree can't make the time us two did. ,22700
Bridger looks back to the trees... then considers something, stares at Fitzgerald a beat, before... ,47000
BRIDGER It was twenty earlier. ,2700000
FITZGERALD What? ,42500
BRIDGER When you woke me... you said you'd spotted twenty `Ree. ,12900
FITZGERALD A dozen... twenty. ,382000
I wasn't in a mood to count feathers. ,515000
Hell, one `Ree woulda been too many. ,3660000
Fitzgerald empties his canteen over the fire, killing the flames. ,20900
Bridger stares at the water pouring out. ,36100
BRIDGER What was you even doin' down at the creak in the middle of the night? (BEAT) I'd already brought plenty a water. ,15900
Fitzgerald doesn't answer. ,1310000
Bridger tightens his grip on his rifle... slowly rises. ,38700
BRIDGER (CONT'D) Answer me. ,69700
FITZGERALD Don't start questionin' me on accounta you feelin' guilty `bout leavin' your nigger buddy behind. ,812
Bridger musters up all the courage he can... aims his rifle at Fitzgerald. ,90100
BRIDGER ANSWER ME OR I BLOW YOUR DAMN HEAD OFF! 36. ,359000
Fitzgerald stares back at Bridger and his rifle... eyes taking in everything... a snake sizing up its prey. ,16
Then Fitzgerald stands... takes a step toward the boy. ,817000
FITZGERALD What're you askin'? ,815000
Why it was you turned your back on Glass? ,77900000
Why you let him die to save your own sorry skin? (BEAT) `Cause you was scared shitless, that's why. ,30800
BRIDGER The `Ree... did you see `em? (off Fitzgerald's silence) DID YOU SEE `EM? FITZGERALD (MOVING CLOSER) Not a one. ,219000
Bridger CRIES OUT... starts to pull the trigger, when Fitzgerald's hand flashes out, grabbing the barrel, and shoving the butt back into Bridger's face... ,61
THWACK. The force of the blow knocks Bridger back to the ground, but Fitzgerald holds his grip on the rifle barrel... flips it around to aim it at the boy. ,2000
Blood drips down Bridger's head as he stares up at his rifle pointed down. ,12300
Fitzgerald's finger tightens on the trigger. ,35700
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) So that there is the answer to your question. ,242000
And Fitzgerald PULLS THE TRIGGER... ,3410000
AND BRIDGER SQUEEZES HIS EYES SHUT IN FEAR... ,114000
THEN CLICK. Bridger opens his eyes... sees Fitzgerald sneering down at him. ,872000
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) And the next time you aim to kill somebody, kid, best remember your gun won't fire without a flint. ,1040
Fitzgerald tosses the rifle back at Bridger, and turns away. ,54600
Bridger's face flushes with rage and humiliation... he charges Fitzgerald from behind... tackles him to the ground... starts pounding Fitzgerald with punches. ,3390
A few of them land, but it's only a moment before Fitzgerald is back in control... ,1790000
HEAD-BUTTING Bridger off of him... 37. tossing him away, then KICKING BRIDGER IN THE STOMACH... ,15000
AGAIN. He grabs his knife... is ready to finish Bridger off... ...but Fitzgerald is smart enough to know that out here, two are safer than one... even when one is just a kid. ,He starts walking away. ,7170000
BRIDGER I'm goin' back for him. ,2900000
FITZGERALD Far as we ran all night, you couldn't find Glass with dogs and a map. ,And I don't believe you really want to. `Cause after leavin' him to die the first time, I doubt he'd be too happy to see you now. ,219000
Fitzgerald digs at the dirt with the knife... covers the fire's remains. ,84600
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) And just so we're clear. ,258000
If you try to backtrack without me knowin', or ever get so guilty you feel the need to tell somebody. ,420000
Fitzgerald looks at Bridger... hard... evil. ,20600
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) I'll have no choice but to gut you from nuts to nose. ,4130
Fitzgerald stares his point home, then shoves the blade into his belt, and stands. ,10300
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) Now let's go. ,122000
Bridger wipes the blood from his face, then throws one last glance behind him before following Fitzgerald. ,43
EXT. CAMP - MORNING Empty and quiet... no sign of life... until GLASS' HAND RISES BETWEEN THE BRANCHES. His fingers dig into the earth, pulling himself up from the hole... a dead man climbing out of his own grave. ,25
He rolls out to the ground... arches in pain when his back hits the cold, hard surface. 38. ,28400
Glass lies there shivering, regaining what little strength he has, then rolls over... starts dragging himself again with that one good arm. ,3780
He makes it to the blanket... wraps it around him. ,173000
Glass rests there in the center of camp... unable to move... his eyes scanning the surroundings... no food... no water... and he's wide open in this clearing... an easy target for any predator. ,14500
So he grabs his Possibles bag and GUNPOWDER HORN, and drags himself toward the cover of brush. ,12100
And every movement takes all the will Glass has... a push with his good leg followed by a pull with his healthy arm... inch by inch... foot by foot... sweat pouring down his face as he finally reaches the cover of the trees... continues on... dragging himself across the forest floor in a desperate, hopeless crawl for survival. ,639
But finally it's too much for Glass... the fever and pain overwhelm him. ,3330000
He collapses... falls unconscious. ,613000
EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY Glass lies in the dirt, weak... dehydrated... starving. ,26200
He looks at his hands... scratched and bloody from clawing his weight. ,127000
He unwraps his small, leather Possibles bag... dumps it to the ground, revealing it contents... flints, a straight razor, his map, and a LEATHER NECKLACE WITH THE SIX-INCH BEAR CLAW attached. ,580
Glass grabs the razor... cuts SEVERAL THIN STRIPS FROM THE BLANKET, and wraps them around his hands. ,13200
He shoves the rest back in the bag, and does the only thing he can do... start crawling again... push with his healthy leg... pull with his good arm. ,77700
EXT. WILDERNESS - LATER Glass dragging himself up a steep slope... over rocks... the jagged edges catching the wounds... tearing the primitive stitching. ,719
The gashes rip wider... blood oozes down, leaving a crimson trail dripping down the rock behind him. ,10300
EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT The wind is howling through the trees. ,157000
Glass lies beneath a cluster of brush... shivering... bleeding. ,48200
Every aching breath creates a puff of smoke in the cold, night air. 39. ,25400
EXT. MARSH - DAY Thick with a sea of four-foot high Cattails... like miniature cornstalks. ,28100
Looking down from above the marsh we see a two- foot wide path of crushed plants that reaches the center of the marsh, and stops. ,940
We tighten on the end of the path, until we see Glass lying among the Cattails. ,6250
He's sawing off one of the stalks with the straight razor... peeling away the husk, and eating the tender flesh beneath. ,6710
Mosquitoes move in clouds around him... over his face... arms. ,1280000
But Glass' injured body only allows him one action at a time, so the mosquitoes have their fill of him, as he gnaws on the Cattail. ,4470
EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY Glass pulling himself along the ground... stopping to tear a FEW BERRIES from a plant, and shove them in his mouth. ,9630
He flinches as he swallows. ,6
He starts to move again, but freezes... listens... ,73600
RUSHING WATER. Glass digs his fingers into the ground with new energy... pulls himself toward the sound... up over a ridge... and there it is at the bottom of the ridge... ...THE GRAND RIVER... ,37000
WATER. Glass crawls down toward it. ,18600
EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY Glass drags himself to the river's edge, cupping handfuls of water and rubbing it over his parched lips... withstanding the pain to gulp it down. ,14
As he does, Glass notices a FISH hovering in the shallows beside him. ,62600
He makes a desperate grab for the fish, but it darts easily away. ,478000
Glass cups more water to his mouth, but with each drink, he feels the water leak from a hole in his throat... run down his neck. ,177000
He leans out over the surface to check his reflection... barely recognizes the swollen, stitched- together, disfigured face staring back at him. ,6540
He fights off the urge to vomit... pulls the razor from the leather bag, and cuts more strips of blanket, soaking them in the river, then cleaning his wounds. 40. ,8510
He runs a finger up to his shredded throat... around the open, wet hole. ,He cups another handful of water to his mouth... strains to swallow, then feels the liquid GURGLE OUT OF THE HOLE. Glass shoves the cloth against the wound... tries to press the flesh together... no good. ,1720
He dumps out his Possibles bag... stares at the meager contents. ,12200
He picks up one of the flints... looks to the powderhorn. ,81900
EXT. GRAND RIVER - LATER ANGLE ON A SMALL CLUMP OF DRIED GRASS... ...as Glass SPARKS one of the flints... ignites the grass. ,24
As the fire grows, Glass pours a handful of GUNPOWDER from the horn, and RUBS IT ALL OVER THE HOLE IN HIS THROAT. He lifts several small blades of burning grass... a miniature torch. ,1700
And only then do we realize what he's about to do... because he stares at the flame a beat, then raises it toward his gunpowder-covered throat. ,3530
The flame nears the black powder, and LEAPS OFF THE GRASS, igniting the powder, and SETTING GLASS'S NECK ON FIRE. Glass falls back to the ground in agony... ,868
TRIES TO SCREAM, but his burning, shredded vocal chords won't allow him. ,70400
The gunpowder sizzles and burns... the flame spreads... ,13100
Glass' flesh sears... melts. ,180000
And the pain is too much for Glass... he passes out. ,3190000
EXT. GRAND RIVER - NIGHT ANGLE ON GLASS... looking dead beside the river, but we know he's alive because we can hear those same painful, raspy breaths. ,38
And then we hear something else... an O.S. ,2790000
RATTLING, growing LOUDER... ,724000
FASTER... ,15700000
BUZZING... until Glass' eyes flash open. ,961000
CUT TO: GLASS' POV - ON A RATTLESNAKE COILED INCHES FROM HIS FACE. Glass stares back in horror... has time to throw up his arm in protection as the snake STRIKES... ,5000
SINKS ITS FANGS INTO HIS FOREARM. 41. ,13300
He shakes it free, but can't escape the snake's next strike... locking its jaws onto Glass' burned throat. ,642
Glass opens his mouth to scream. ,1490000
CUT TO: EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY And Glass' eyes flying open in the glaring sun, as he awakens from his nightmare... looks to his arm... no snake. ,9310
His hand instinctively jumps to his melted throat. ,304000
No bites. ,64500
But that's when he hears it... we all do... that same RATTLING FROM HIS DREAM. Glass slowly turns his head toward the sound... ...and there's a RATTLESNAKE COILED just a few feet away. ,1970
Only it isn't poised to attack Glass. ,34300
It's facing the other way, its target a FIELD MOUSE, trapped against a rock. ,424000
The snake attacks, sinking its fangs into the mouse. ,35400
The field mouse tumbles over... quivers as the poison runs through its body, then dies. ,2650
As Glass watches the snake begin to make a meal of the mouse, his hand grips a rock. ,41200
He drags himself toward the occupied snake... raises the rock high, then SMASHES IT DOWN ON THE SNAKE'S HEAD. Glass immediately pulls the razor from his bag, and slices off the rattlesnake's head, the field mouse still lodged halfway inside. ,1060
Glass then drags the razor down the length of the snake... digs his fingers under the fresh seam, then peels the outer layer down off the rattler. ,1920
With the skin still hanging off the round tube of flesh, Glass BITES INTO THE SNAKE, tearing off a chunk of meat. ,45700
He gobbles it down, slowing only to painfully swallow the food past his injured throat. ,16400
EXT. GRAND RIVER - LATER ANGLE ON THE REMAINS OF THE SNAKE... ...the head, skin, and not much else. ,2980
GLASS - at the water's edge, drinking... touching his charred, melted throat... no leaks. ,13100
He opens his Possibles bag... pulls out the GRIZZLY CLAW NECKLACE... stares at it a beat, then slips it over his head. 42. ,22100
He drags out the map... spreads it on the ground, then throws a glance around him... fingers the point on the blue line... a rough guess of his location. ,25900
ANGLE ON THE MAP... ...Fort Union at the top... hundreds of miles north. ,195000
Fort Brazeau south... but not nearly as far away. ,838000
Glass gazes north up the Grand, as if he can see Fitzgerald and Bridger just ahead of him. ,95800
Then he looks back down to his reflection in the water... battered and scarred. ,6420000
He looks to his leg... all but worthless for now... his one good arm. ,3080000
It's clear he's not ready to take revenge on anyone. ,2200000
So Glass shoves the map back into the bag... ties it around his arm with the powderhorn and blanket, then grabs a THICK, FALLEN LOG, and rolls it into the river. ,11
Glass crawls in behind it... deeper, until the current grows strong enough to carry the weight of his mangled body downstream. ,98600
Glass drapes his healthy arm over the log, and starts floating... letting the river do the work. ,47400
He watches the land move past him faster than it has in days... and without all the agony of every move. ,949000
EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY Winding through the open prairie. ,327000
Glass hangs onto the log... floats with the gentle current. ,11000
EXT. GRAND RIVER - EVENING The sinking sun casts an orange glow over the water. ,3650
Glass floats downstream... past a HERD OF ELK grazing along the riverbank. ,12200
The animals don't even notice him. ,2090000
EXT. GRAND RIVER - NIGHT Dark... the moon hidden behind clouds. ,47700
A heavy mist hangs over the river. ,163000
Glass is draped across the log, eyes closed... letting the slow current carry him south. ,233000
But then his eyes open... because he hears something... a LOW RUMBLE. Glass looks to the river banks... too foggy to see anything clearly. ,135000
The RUMBLE GROWS LOUDER. He peers ahead... too dark to see much... just ANOTHER SPLINTERED LOG floating in front of him, its one jagged branch rising up in the air. 43. ,322
But then THE LOG VANISHES. Glass squints through the fog, scanning the surface. ,811
But it's gone... the water's empty... that LOW RUMBLE GROWS EVEN LOUDER. Glass looks to the water beside him... a BRANCH GLIDES PAST AT A HIGHER SPEED. And now Glass knows what's coming, but it's too late... because the world suddenly turns upside down, as Glass tumbles over the edge of a TWENTY FOOT WATERFALL. He spirals downward... crashes into the rushing current. ,6040
He's washed forward with the suddenly violent rapids. ,163000
They pull him under the surface, then toss him GASPING back out. ,58000
The river carries him blindly through the mist... tossing... turning... ,4650
SLAMMING HIM INTO A HUGE BOULDER... ,9990
CRACK... he spins off, swept away headfirst... the foaming water sucking him down the rocky gauntlet. ,31800
He tumbles over more boulders... his Possibles bag snaps loose... ,10600
Glass makes a grab for it, but is suddenly flipped down another set of falls. ,93100
The Possibles Bag is lost in the raging river. ,93300
Glass sinks beneath the surface, then floats back up, as the rapids calm... spit Glass to the gentle shallows. ,36
His body drifts face-down toward shore. ,350000
And just when we're sure Glass has to finally be dead, his arm reaches up from the water... he digs his fingers into the muddy bank, and drags himself out of the river. ,1330
Glass collapses unconscious to the ground, his body shrouded in that mist. ,47100
EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY TIGHT ON THE LEFT SIDE OF GLASS' FACE... the right still pressed into the muddy bank. ,7120
The sun beats down... then SHADOWS APPEAR... ,2730000
BOUNCE ACROSS HIM... something is standing over Glass. ,2460000
And then a VULTURE'S HEAD DROPS INTO FRAME... ...latches its beak onto Glass' cheek... tugs at it... stretches it. ,9870
Glass' eyes pop open... we PULL BACK to see THREE VULTURES surrounding Glass' body, pecking and clawing at his battered wounds. 44. ,9360
Glass swings his good arm, knocking one of the vultures away. ,18900
He tries to cry out, but only that PRIMITIVE HISS ERUPTS from his throat. ,12300
The vultures dance away from his flailing... aren't willing to give up their meal so easily... dart in for quick attacks on his flesh. ,5360
Glass grasps a branch... swings at the birds, beating them back. ,1190000
The vultures give up the battle... fly away. ,366000
Glass crumbles back to the ground... squints up into the sun... the SILHOUETTES OF THE VULTURES CIRCLING ABOVE HIM... waiting for him to die. ,337
Glass looks down to his wounds, again oozing blood. ,2540000
He glances around... sees a ridge just a few hundred yards away. ,44700
At the base of the ridge, a GIANT BOULDER has broken free, creating a partial cave. ,20700
Glass starts crawling toward it. ,7170000
And if it's possible, he looks even closer to death now than when he started this journey. ,142000
EXT. CAVE - DAY No more than ten feet deep, but enough to hide from predators. ,139000
Glass drags himself as far back in the recess as he can... collapses against the rock wall. ,45900
INT. CAVE - DAY Glass gathers loose sticks and grass into a small pile... begins sparking rocks together to build a fire. ,20200
INT. CAVE - LATER The fire burns beside Glass, as he TEARS A SINGLE THREAD of cloth from the tattered blanket, then feeds it through a tiny hole in a JAGGED, NEEDLE-SIZED SLIVER OF SHARPENED ROCK... a man-made needle and thread. ,1640
Glass goes to work on the open wounds of his chest... piercing his skin with the rock... wincing with pain as he tugs the thread through the fresh hole in his skin... pierces the other side of the wound, then pulls the flesh tightly together... before repeating the excruciating process all over again... pierce... pull... pierce... tighten. 45. ,679
EXT. GRAND RIVER - NIGHT The moon's glow reflects off the water. ,241000
INT. CAVE - NIGHT ANGLE ON GLASS' HAND... ...holding a small sharp stone, and SCRATCHING LETTERS INTO THE CAVE'S ROCK WALL. WE PAN DOWN TO THE GROUND... still listening to the SCRATCHING OF THE ROCK as we glide across the dirt... reach the fire... its flame warm and strong. ,14400
We TIGHTEN ON THE FIRE, until WE'RE INSIDE IT... and then WE PULL BACK... ...and we see the fire has long died away... just black ash. ,11300
The O.S. ,1320000000
SCRATCHING has silenced. ,24300
We glide back across the cave floor... to Glass unconscious on the ground. ,15100
And above him on the wall, we see what he had been scratching... "Robbed and left to die by Fitzgerald and Bridger. ,37000
If find eether kill for Hugh Glass" We hold on those words a beat, then... ,549000
DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY DROPS OF RAIN dot the surface. ,254000
THUNDER RUMBLES... the rain grows heavier. ,72700
EXT. CAVE - NIGHT Rain pouring... gullies of water run down the ridge, spewing over the mouth of the cave. ,11300
But inside, Glass doesn't stir... lying there just as we last saw him. ,88500
EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY Rain coming down in buckets. ,402000
The river's raging. ,1060000
EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT Clouds drift across the moon... the storm has ended. 46. ,48
EXT. CAVE - DAY Sunny and clear. ,4510000
A rabbit hops along... stops for a moment outside the cave. ,16300
Beyond it, Glass is still sprawled on the cave floor... he must be dead. ,129000
The rabbit continues on past. ,4620000
INT. CAVE - DAY TIGHT ON GLASS' FACE... as his eyes flutter open. ,120000
He stares straight ahead, unmoving. ,56300
EXT. CAVE - DAY Glass crawls out of the crevice... shields his eyes from the sun, as he takes in the scene. ,2740
The river has sunk back to normal, leaving the banks battered and muddy. ,7340
The water is thick and brown with all the flooded earth it pulled up. ,44600000
Glass uses all his strength to rise up to his knees, then higher... onto his healthy leg. ,206000
He braces himself against a tree. ,77000
He's still crooked and hunched over, but for the first time since the Grizzly attack, he looks more like a man than an animal. ,3010
He bends down... picks up a BROKEN TREE BRANCH. EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY Glass limps along the bank... beside the brown water stirred up from the flood. ,39
He moves along the washed-out area, searching for food... grabs some plants... tears them from the ground to chew on the roots. ,5170
He continues on... spots a DEAD SNAPPING TURTLE drowned in the flood, frozen on its back. ,14900
Glass kneels down to pick up the turtle... sniffs it. ,417000
As he does, he spots something across the river... a DEER, staring back at him. ,165000
Glass slowly raises his IMAGINARY RIFLE... takes careful aim at the deer... pulls the trigger. ,6120
If only he had his Anstadt. ,7460000
But then the deer's head snaps... to something beyond Glass. ,112000
Glass follows the animal's eyes... turns to the ridge... and the FIVE ARIKARA WARRIORS STANDING AT GLASS' CAVE. Glass drops flat to the ground behind a tree uprooted in the flood. ,1030
He looks back across the river... ,73600000
THE DEER IS LONG GONE. 47. ,84200
Glass inches his head up over the tree... to the warriors now crouched outside the cave... studying the tracks. ,23100
Glass' eyes jump to the soft dirt along the river... ,1390000
HIS FOOTPRINTS CLEAR... an obvious trail leading right to him. ,162000
He throws a glance around... nowhere to run even if he could. ,39900
So he starts backing into the river on his stomach... feet- first... dragging a small branch over the tracks around him, wiping them away as he moves. ,7940
And his eyes are locked on the Arikara... watching to see if they spot him. ,327000
But they haven't yet, and Glass keeps sliding backward... five feet off shore... only three feet deep in the murky water and sludge. ,286
But if he goes any further, the current will catch him... pull him into the next set of violent rapids... and make him a clear target. ,8610
The Arikara follow the tracks down from the cave. ,556000
Glass sinks neck-deep into the water... the Arikara keep coming... near the river. ,51700
So Glass drops beneath the surface. ,102000
CUT TO: UNDERWATER - And Glass' eyes spread wide... searching the muddy water. ,498000
He grabs a LARGE ROCK... rolls onto his back, and places the rock on his stomach, its weight holding him firmly to the river bottom. ,5940
EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY ANGLE ON THE ARIKARA WARRIORS... following Glass' tracks to the edge of the river... looking out over the brown river. ,2530
CUT TO: UNDERWATER - Glass pressing his head back against the bottom... staring up through the cloudy water... to the FIVE SHADOWS STANDING ONLY A FEW FEET AWAY. EXT. GRAND RIVER - CONTINUOUS The Arikara... unknowingly standing just above Glass... looking back to the tracks... scanning the water. ,22
But the surface is empty, and the river's too thick with mud to see anything below. 48. ,229000
But they keep looking... and we're waiting for Glass to explode from the river, gasping for air. ,26600
But he doesn't... and they keep scanning for what seems an eternity, until finally, the warriors turn... start walking back up the path. ,8610
Behind them, Glass' face inches to the surface... pulls in some oxygen... watches as they fade into the trees. ,123000
Then Glass rolls the rock away... starts moving deeper into the river... fighting the current to grab rocks and boulders... pulling himself to the other side. ,1090
EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY Glass limps through the trees, still dripping with the muddy water of the Grand. ,851
EXT. WILDERNESS - LATER Glass is on his knees, desperately grabbing for a TINY FIELD MOUSE. The rodent escapes into a hole. ,17800
Glass claws at the ground after it. ,255000
He's starving to death. ,1140000
EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT The rain beating down through the trees. ,170000
Glass huddles in a cluster of bushes, trying to stay dry... shivering in the cold. ,12300
He reaches out from the cover, grabbing his moccasin boot standing in the rain. ,14400
He pulls it in... slurps back the rainfall that it's caught. ,289000
EXT. PRAIRIE - EVENING Glass limps slowly across the rolling prairie. ,1550
He's weak... starving... isn't going to make it much further. ,1050000
He drops to his hands and knees. ,3160000
And then he feels something... the ground almost trembling under his hands. ,718000
He watches his hands quiver with vibration. ,64500
A RUMBLE BUILDS. Glass strains to hear... looks to the crest of a hill... labors up the gentle slope toward the sound. ,4670
EXT. PRAIRIE/HILL - EVENING Glass reaches the crest... looks over the other side to a HERD OF BUFFALO THUNDERING ACROSS THE PRAIRIE. 49. ,30
An incredible site... hundreds of massive creatures... their hooves tearing up the earth, leaving a cloud of dust behind them. ,1820
Behind the herd, a PACK OF WOLVES FIGHT OVER A FALLEN BUFFALO. Glass lies in the high grass, watching the wolves SNARL AND SNAP over the remains. ,824
And he eyes that buffalo... the closest he's been to food in days. ,14700000
EXT. PLAINS - NIGHT The five wolves rest around the downed buffalo, their snouts bloody from the meal. ,2730
Suddenly, one of the wolves' heads snaps up... bares its teeth... ,31300
SNARLS. And then we see what the wolf is growling at... ,105000
Glass... limping out of the shadows toward the animals, holding a BURNING SAGE BUSH IN EACH HAND... like giant FLAMING HANDS clawing in the night. ,47400
The wolves jump to their feet, unsure of what's approaching. ,858000
They growl at Glass. ,1140000
But Glass keeps coming... doing his best to YELL... more like GROWL back at the wolves. ,21900
He swings the flaming brush, tossing glowing sparks through the air. ,13800
The wolves spread out, instinctively surrounding Glass. ,203000
But Glass singles out each one... charges, waving the flames... driving each wolf back. ,98500
Four of the wolves back away, but the leader holds its ground... even moves toward Glass... only a few feet away... ,18800
SNARLING... bloody jaws ready to attack, but still not sure what its up against. ,1100000
Glass shakes the flames at the wolf... it SNAPS AT GLASS' ARM. Glass swings the other... slams the fiery plant across the wolf's head. ,35700
The wolf YELPS... leaps back... starts to run away, but turns back... makes another charge at Glass. ,6530
But Glass is ready... throws the flaming ball of sage at the wolf, then clubs it with the other. ,106000
The animal's fur begins to burn. ,82000
The frightened wolf has had enough... rolls on the ground, then spins to join the rest of its pack. ,6500
They run a safe distance, then stop... keeping a watch on Glass. 50. ,13400000
Glass drags the burning sage bushes along the ground, igniting the grass and brush... creating a foot-high flaming wall between him and the wolves. ,9230
He stretches the flame into a circle, a fiery ring surrounds the fallen buffalo. ,5140
The wolves have seen enough... turn... race away from the flames. ,130000
As the grass around him burns, Glass drops the sage plants... attacks the buffalo remains, tearing away bloody chunks of flesh from the carcass, and shoving them into his mouth... a starving animal that's finally found food. ,720
EXT. PRAIRIE - NIGHT From high above the prairie... ,7860000
Glass and the buffalo at the center of that glowing ring of fire. ,1060000
EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY The wind's gusting... bending the high golden grass over on its side. ,490000
Glass moves slowly across, pulling his collar up to shield his face from the cold winds. ,17400
He spots something in the distant sky ahead... a THIN LINE OF BLACK SMOKE. Glass picks up his pace... hope spurring him on. ,53000
EXT. BURNED ARIKARA VILLAGE - DAY The charred, skeletal remains of a tribe's village... just black posts where tee-pees once stood... a half-burned log lodge still smokes, sending that black line into the sky. ,13
Glass limps through the graveyard of structures... all signs of life in this village long gone. ,27
He searches a basket... pulls out a BLANKET... wraps it around his shoulders. ,122000
INT. LODGE - DAY Glass steps into the smoky warmth of the lodge... black and empty. ,7240
He slides down to the floor... unwraps strips of roasted buffalo from what's left of his blanket. ,15500
He starts to take a bite, when SOMETHING DARTS PAST THE DOORWAY TO THE BACK ROOM. The O.S. ,80600
SHUFFLING OF FEET. Glass freezes... he isn't alone. ,71200
He rises... grabs a splintered post like a spear... eases toward the doorway... raises the post to swing... 51. ...and sees the SMALL PUPPY standing in the back room. ,2140
The dog takes off around a crumbled wall. ,31900000
Glass follows it. ,19
INT. LODGE/BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS Glass limps across the room... turns the corner of the crumbled wall... and sees the dog slide to a stop beside an ANCIENT ARIKARA SQUAW, huddled in the corner, her bony arms outstretched in front of her in weak defense. ,5
And her eyes are SOLID WHITE... the old woman is blind. ,209000
She CRIES OUT A CHANT over and over... her death chant, as she waits for this stranger to kill her. ,29300
Glass stands frozen... confused. ,423000
He tries to speak, but his throat still won't let him. ,2840000
He crouches down in front of the old woman... reaches for her hand, but she flails him away. ,293000
He grabs her again... gently... just holds it until she calms... studying the woman... her hollow face all skin and bones... she's obviously dying. ,1480
He pulls the strip of buffalo meat from his pocket... pushes it into the squaw's hand. ,52400
She immediately jerks it to her mouth... and that's when Glass sees the WOMAN HAS NO TEETH... she can't eat. ,273000
Glass turns to an old pot tipped over on the floor. ,376000
EXT. BURNED ARIKARA VILLAGE - DAY Glass carries the pot toward a nearby stream. ,23200
The dog scurries out behind him... follows Glass to the water. ,3300000
INT. LODGE/BACK ROOM - DAY The pot boils over burning logs. ,21400
Glass dips a cup in, pulling out a warm broth. ,124000
He carries it to the squaw, still sitting in the corner... takes her hand, placing the cup in it for her. ,7750
She gulps the liquid back. ,199000
Glass goes back to refill the cup. ,1890000
The old woman MUMBLES SOMETHING we can't understand... over and over, as Glass brings the cup back to her. ,198000
He tries to ease it into her hand, but the woman pushes it away... slides her hand up Glass' arm to his face... patting it... ,173000
MUMBLING THOSE SAME WORDS... thanking Glass. 52. ,136000
EXT. BURNED ARIKARA VILLAGE - EVENING Glass carries several blankets toward the lodge. ,3100
The puppy trails behind him, biting at one of the corners... hanging on as Glass pulls him across the dirt. ,25000
INT. LODGE - EVENING Glass enters the back room with the blankets... stops when he sees the old woman slumped over to the floor, her white eyes frozen open in a lifeless stare. ,1020
EXT. BURNED ARIKARA VILLAGE - NIGHT Glass has stacked several burned posts into a crude pyre at the edge of the village. ,6510
The squaw lies atop the pyre, covered in the blankets he gathered for her. ,54
Glass stands beside the pyre, a FLAMING TORCH in his hand. ,10700
The puppy rests at his feet. ,127000
EXT. DISTANT RIDGE - CONTINUOUS THREE INDIANS sit on horseback, watching Glass light the pyre... the flames rise into the night. ,14900
EXT. BURNED ARIKARA VILLAGE - NIGHT Glass crouches... pets the dog, as he watches the flames spread... engulf the woman. ,598
ANGLE ON THE GLOWING EMBERS... ...floating into the night. ,105000
Beyond the sparks, we see something else... ,3970000
THOSE THREE INDIANS GALLOPING TOWARD THE VILLAGE... ,100000
FAST. And now Glass sees them too... knows it's too late to run, so he just stands there. ,319000
But the dog's seen enough... darts away. ,60500
Glass watches the Indians ride into the village... their braided hair and dress is different than the Arikara we've seen earlier, because these are SIOUX WARRIORS, and Glass knows it. ,49400
The Sioux surround Glass on horseback... stare down at Glass. ,134000
The lead warrior (SPOTTED HORSE), (30's), poised and strong, points to the flaming pyre... says something to Glass. 53. ,47100
Glass tries to answer... can't... touches his scarred throat. ,1470000
Spotted Horse slides gracefully off his horse. ,83500
The other two warriors, (THREE FEATHERS and RUNNING FOX) do the same... close in on Glass. ,207000
Glass stands firm. ,517000
Spotted Horse says something else to him. ,1920000
Again, Glass touches his throat... holds his jacket out from his sides... no weapons. ,41000
Spotted Horse studies Glass hard... reaches out, wiping his finger down Glass' cheek, almost testing to see if the color comes off. ,13700
One of the other warriors pats Glass' hair... smiles... says something to the others. ,2070000
Spotted Horse and the other warrior join him, each touching Glass' hair. ,44700
Then Spotted Horse spots Glass' necklace... the grizzly claw hanging from it. ,18300
He examines the enormous claw, then nods to Glass' stitching and scars. ,12400
SPOTTED HORSE Griz-lee. ,14400
Glass hears the familiar word... nods. ,42600
Three Feathers pulls a WHITE SPECK from the back of Glass' neck... holds it up to Spotted Horse. ,4510
Spotted Horse jerks out his knife. ,2030000
Glass is confused... holds up his hand, as he takes a step back. ,618000
But Three Feathers and Running Fox grab Glass... secure him... pull his jacket down off his shoulders, exposing his shirt, as Spotted Horse walks around behind Glass... raises the knife... ,55
Glass GROWLS A PLEA... but Spotted Horse slices the knife down Glass' back... just cutting open his shirt... and revealing a MASS OF WHITE WORMS... ,19
MAGGOTS... ,1360000
COVERING THE DEEP GASHES ON GLASS' BACK. The three warriors exchange glances... they've obviously never seen anything like this. ,10800
Glass sees their reaction... throws a nervous glance... what? ,1980000
Three Feathers runs his hand across Glass' back, dragging a HANDFUL OF WORMS for Glass to see. ,4290
As Glass' eyes widen in panic, Spotted Horse SLAMS THE BUTT OF HIS KNIFE against Glass' head. ,7380
Glass drops to his knees... makes a dazed grab for Spotted Horse... misses... and Spotted Horse HITS GLASS AGAIN. Glass tumbles unconscious to the dirt. ,23
Spotted Horse says something to the others... they grab Glass' limp arms... drag him toward the horses. 54. ,24200
EXT. SIOUX VILLAGE - NIGHT Dozens of glowing campfires dot the prairie, along with a sea of tee-pees, their willow poles fanning against the night sky. ,1580
Animal hides and painted designs decorate the various tee-pees and lodges. ,94900
SIOUX CHILDREN laugh and play about the village... freeze when they hear Spotted Horse and the other riders splash across the stream. ,724
The warriors ride into the village, Glass' body tossed over the back of Three Feather's horse. ,42500
The children race to them. ,403000
ANGLE ON GLASS... regaining consciousness... eyes blinking... trying to focus. ,34100
CUT TO: GLASS' POV - FROM THE BACK OF THE HORSE... ...to the children's eager faces swarming around him... studying this strange face. ,46500
Spotted Horse - YELLING SOMETHING at the children... they back away from Glass... fall into line behind the riders. ,3040000
Sioux MEN and WOMEN watch as the procession moves past... to a tee-pee set away from the rest... its hide walls decorated with wild lightning bolts and buffalo and vaguely human figures circling the sun. ,30
An OLD MEDICINE MAN, gnarled and leathery, a DEAD RAVEN tied in his long hair, his naked chest painted with red and black stripes, steps out of the tee-pee. ,1110
He eyes Glass, as Three Feathers and Running Fox carry him inside. ,64600
Suddenly, the Medicine Man begins CHANTING. CUT TO: A FLURRY OF IMAGES ACCOMPANIED BY THE MEDICINE MAN'S V.O. ,12100
CHANTING... ,3440000
LEATHER STRAPS SNAPPING AROUND GLASS' WRISTS AND ANKLES... stretched tight. ,17800
Glass, naked, on his stomach at the center of the tee-pee, his arms and legs outstretched, secured to wooden stakes in the ground. ,30900
The white worms cover his back. 55. ,3760000
The Medicine Man... ,446000
CHANTING... waving burning sticks in the air. ,49000
A THICK LIQUID BOILING IN A POT... the Medicine Man's twisted hand reaching a gourd container in... filling it with the steaming mixture. ,2660
The liquid POURING OVER GLASS' BACK. GLASS' FACE... arched to the sky... twisted in horrible pain. ,4840
He SCREAMS THAT HORRIBLE GROWLING CRY. MORE IMAGES... even faster... the CHANTING more frantic... ,96100
A SIOUX WOMAN,(WAKI), staring down. ,105000
HANDS wiping a GREEN SLUDGE over Glass' neck... chest. ,90100
The Medicine Man dancing... chanting... shaking sticks lined with RATTLESNAKE TAILS. The moonlight shining through the tee-pee, illuminating the images of the buffalo and dancing shapes. ,39
Waki gently pouring fluid into Glass' mouth. ,276000
The Medicine Man holding the SEVERED HEAD OF A SNAKE... lightly sinking the fangs around the wounds on Glass' throat. ,9280
GLASS' EYES... wide open... rolling up white into his head. ,1670000
AND THE CHANTING STOPS... the world goes dark. ,28400
EXT. YELLOWSTONE RIVER - DAY Cutting through the open prairie. ,269000
Snow-covered peaks touch the sky in the distance. ,251000
Fitzgerald and Bridger trudge their way across the prairie, dressed in furs. ,12300
They rise up a steep slope... reach the top, and spot the cluster of log buildings inside a massive thirty-foot tall wooden fence. ,1130
Fort Union. ,307000
Bridger smiles... relieved. ,4540000
FITZGERALD `Bout goddamn time. ,14200

FORT UNION - DAY Like a small town surrounded by a log wall. ,The main TRADING POST BUILDING is busy... ,TRAPPERS, SIOUX, all with things to trade. ,But most of the life is in the FORT UNION SALOON next door... crowded with customers downstairs, and just as busy in the whores' rooms upstairs. ,A small village of tents rests off to the side of the buildings, holding the overflow of traffic. ,INT. SALOON - DAY Fitzgerald and Bridger enter the crowded room... squeeze their way to the bar. ,FITZGERALD Twice the folks here than when we left. ,BRIDGER We should go see Captain Henry. ,FITZGERALD Far as we hiked... we got time for a drink on the company's tab. 57. ,PIG (O.S.)

Fitzgerald's eyes lock on all that money. ,Henry pulls out a handful... starts counting them out onto the desk. ,HENRY (CONT'D) Am I to assume the agreed arrangement didn't change? ,FITZGERALD Fortunate for me, it did not. ,HENRY Well thank you both for your courage and honor. ,You have done yourselves proud. ,Fitzgerald swipes up his pile of bills. ,Henry drops a couple bills in front of Bridger. ,HENRY (CONT'D) You're owed something for what you did. ,Bridger stares down at the bills a beat, then snatches them... pushes his way out of the office before he might have to look someone in the eye. ,FITZGERALD He's beat hisself up most of the trip... wishin' he'da done more. ,HENRY We all saw the shape Glass was in. ,There was no more to be done. ,FITZGERALD That's what I been tellin' him. 60. ,INT.

But as the wolf comes closer, we see it's not a wolf at all... it's THREE FEATHERS, wearing his WOLF SKIN. He CRIES OUT... ,HOWLING WILDLY. A few yards beside him, another WARRIOR is doing the same... ,CHANTING... beating his spear against the Cottonwoods as he walks. 66. ,GLASS - WEARING THE BUFFALO HIDE... ...walking slowly through the trees, carrying the spear. ,Yellow Bear is beside him... motions for Glass to spread out. ,FROM ABOVE THE TREES... ...we see the fur-covered warriors are formed into a wide circle... and slowly converging... ,YELLING... pounding their spears... making as much noise as possible, as they tighten their ring. ,POV FROM THE BRUSH... ...watching DISTANT CHANTING WARRIORS pushing through the trees. ,V.O. ,SNORTING... our POV darts sideways... charges through the brush... slides to a stop when we see Running Fox moving toward us... spins back another direction. ,GLASS - MOVING THROUGH THE FOREST... ...the falling snow clinging to his face... covering the buffalo hide. ,And then a MASSIVE SHAPE BLASTS through the trees ahead of him. ,Glass freezes, his grip tightening on the spear. ,He looks to Spotted Horse, who nods... ,YELLS OUT, beating his spear against the trees, and motioning for Glass to do the same. ,Glass is apprehensive at first... just lightly tapping his spear. ,But as the other warriors' chants grow, Glass gets caught up in the hunt... begins beating the trees... ,YELLING as loud as his throat will allow. ,THE WARRIORS - EYES PIERCING THROUGH THE SNOW... ,CHANTING... ,BEATING THE BUSHES.

BRIDGER Figured wrong. 75. ,12600
Fitzgerald throws Bridger a glare... wants to throw more, but Bridger's returning the stare... hard... so Fitzgerald decides he'd better not push it. ,1220
FITZGERALD Waste a time to check traps in this weather... while Henry sits warmin' his ass on the stove in his office. ,6120

EXT. MISSOURI RIVER - NIGHT Out of sight from the fort. ,125000
Fitzgerald slides the ANSTADT FROM UNDER HIS COAT... hurries down the bank... searches under the brush and snow... pulls out an OVERTURNED CANOE. He drags it to the icy edge... slides it across the ice toward the middle of the river, where the water still hasn't frozen over. ,524
The ice CRACKS UNDER HIS FEET. Fitzgerald climbs in the canoe... pounds the ice with the oar, breaking it loose. ,11000

An O.S. ,757000
SNORT from the Paint Mare, tied to a tree. ,14100
Glass looks over in time to see the horse's ears perk up. ,11200000
With his eyes searching the darkness, Glass slowly reaches over... grabs his rifle. ,6810
Then he drops to his stomach... slides backward into the brush. 78. ,11400
Glass peers through the brush... the woods seem empty... until SEVERAL DARK SHAPES APPEAR... moving through the distant trees... coming straight toward Glass' camp. ,13900
Then an O.S. ,SNAP BEHIND GLASS... he glances back in time to see an ARIKARA WARRIOR SWINGING A HATCHET. Glass spins his rifle... shoves it into the stomach of the Warrior as he swings... ,746
BOOM... the Warrior flies back. ,495000
The dark woods suddenly ERUPT IN WAR CRIES... ,2260
Arikara appear from all sides... charge toward the camp. ,203000
Glass scrambles up... races toward the Paint Mare as ARROWS AND GUNSHOTS FLASH THROUGH THE AIR ALL AROUND HIM. Glass swings up onto the Paint Mare... spots ELK'S TONGUE leading the charge... the necklace of ears hanging around his neck. ,1080
And Elk's Tongue's eyes are locked on Glass... almost like he remembers him. ,83900
Glass takes off through the forest. ,469000
EXT. FOREST - NIGHT Glass hanging onto the paint mare, as she gallops through the trees... the animal's nostrils spread wide, pulling in all the oxygen it can. ,27

HORSES... ridden by Elk's Tongue and eight other warriors. ,96000
Glass digs his heels into the horse, squeezing every ounce of speed from her legs... pushing her toward the clearing up ahead... throwing another glance back... then looking in front of him, and realizing it isn't a clearing at all... ...it's the edge of the world. ,619
The paint mare explodes from the trees, then runs out of ground... because she's just galloped off the side of a cliff. ,5300
The horse sails downward toward a thick forest of trees, its legs flailing for something to stand on. ,9400
Glass drops the rifle to grip the horse's mane, hanging on for what seems an endless fall. 79. ,8900
The mare SLAMS LEG-FIRST INTO THE TREE-TOPS with Glass still on her back. ,16700
The Paint Mare SQUEALS as she drops into the snow-covered trees, carrying Glass with her. ,45200
CUT TO: EXT. FOREST - CONTINUOUS And the horse comes crashing through the branches... the massive limbs slowing her fall... snapping off as her body hits and twists... tosses Glass away. ,2100
The Paint Mare continues her deadly descent, the trees tearing at her body... catching her head... ,25600
SNAPPING her neck. ,48300
Glass slams off a branch... tumbles to the ground with a thud. ,12300
The Paint Mare hits the snow beside him... very dead. ,41100
Glass struggles to breath... finally GASPS... sucks in the oxygen. ,58200
He lays there a moment... stares up through the trees... ...to Elk's Tongue and the others staring down from the top of the cliff... with no way to get to Glass. ,3490
Glass rises to his knees... glances around for his rifle... lost. ,38100
He flinches with what must be broken ribs... drags himself up, and staggers to the horse... pulls his knife and cuts the snowshoes from the back of the saddle. ,1450
He throws the snowshoes over his shoulder... continues on, through the woods... alone... in the middle of nowhere... again. ,7260

A gang of TRAPPERS drink and play cards. ,23800
A RUNTY MAN stands behind the counter, watching them... ...until the door blows open, and in steps Glass. ,37600
He pulls the fur hat away from his face, and what a sight he is... scarred face stiff from the cold... ice frozen in his beard. ,10700
The room falls silent... everyone staring at Glass. ,1530000
Until TRAPPER #1 snorts a laugh. ,586000
Glass limps to the counter. ,66300
All eyes follow him. ,177000

The Runty Man just stares at Glass... grins a TOOTHLESS GRIN. RUNTY MAN What the fuck happened to your face, boy? ,12000

TRAPPER #2 Maybe we oughta help him do it right. ,8260000

RUNTY MAN (to the trappers) Do you believe this shit? ,1750000
Trapper #1 and Trapper #2 pull the SKINNING KNIVES from their belts... start toward Glass. ,8250000
FAT TRAPPER Hell, I warned ya. ,114000
GLASS All I need... ,942000
And that's when Trapper #1 grabs for Glass, but in a flash of movement that catches them all off-guard, Glass has is own knife pulled and JAMMED UNDER TRAPPER #1's CHIN. Everyone freezes. ,1150000
GLASS (CONT'D) ...is a horse and enough supplies to get me to Fort Union. ,200000
Then Glass slides Trapper #1's PISTOL from his belt... aims it at the other men. ,3090000
GLASS (CONT'D) And this shooter here. ,42600
All made good by Captain Henry and The Rocky Mountain Fur Company. ,13800000

BOOM... fires a wild shot past the riders. ,303000
CUT TO: GLASS - GALLOPING AWAY ON HORSEBACK... ...with Trapper #1 sitting backward on the horse behind him. ,222000
Glass has the pistol jammed into his ribs, and keeps glancing back to the men growing smaller behind him. ,7360
Finally, Glass shoves the man off the back of the horse. ,Trapper #1 tumbles into the snow. ,8440000
The RUMBLE OF DISTANT GUNSHOTS... too far away to reach Glass, who just keeps racing north. ,12900
CUT TO: THE RUNTY MAN - WATCHING GLASS ESCAPE. RUNTY MAN Get after the son of a bitch! The trappers exchange glances... don't move. ,1130
TRAPPER #2 It's cold as hell, Cees. ,8280000

EXT. FORT UNION/BLOCKHOUSE - NIGHT Stubby Bill sits dozing in a chair, his rifle across his lap. ,11
O.S. ,15900000
CRUNCHING... getting louder... loud enough to nudge Stubby Bill awake. ,12100
He sits up... peers over the wall, but can't see anything in the fog... just hears the CRUNCHING MOVING CLOSER... ,10600
FOOTSTEPS IN THE CRISP SNOW. CUT TO: STUBBY BILL'S POV... ...on the blanket of fog hanging in the air... that same CRUNCHING, as a SHADOW APPEARS... growing clearer... a FIGURE walking... leading a horse behind him... appearing out of the mist like a ghost... ,576
GLASS. STUBBY BILL - STARES DOWN IN SHOCK... ...sure his eyes are betraying him. ,152000

STUBBY BILL Jesus Christ. ,1630000
INT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT Dark and quiet... just Pig's snoring rattling the silence. ,11100
Suddenly the door kicks open... ,233000
SLAMS into the wall... and there's GLASS' SILHOUETTE FILLING THE DOORWAY. GROANS from the awakened men... hands moving through the dark for oil lamps... turning them bright... until the room's fully lit... and they all see Glass standing there... eyes floating across the room, searching for a target. ,629
The men just stare back at him, like they're all part of the same dream. ,4480000
Except for Bridger, who's propped up in his cot like he's been waiting all night... waiting every night... for Glass to appear in that doorway. ,6270
BRIDGER I'm sorry. ,2370000
Glass raises the stolen pistol... aims it at Bridger. ,749000
And the young man doesn't flinch... almost as if he wants to make sure Glass doesn't miss. 84. ,431000
The other men just watch in silence, not sure what the hell's going on. ,23500000
Glass holds his aim on Bridger's face... a face that's haunted him... kept him alive. ,2330000
GLASS You took everything I had... left me to die. ,30400000
Glass walks toward Bridger, the gun still raised... each step of his feet on the wood floor is like the thud of an executioner's drum. ,7860
MUMBLING from the other men, as they watch this ghost reach Bridger... stand over him, the pistol aimed down. ,6390
GLASS (CONT'D) Why? ,79400000
BRIDGER I was scared of dyin'. (BEAT) But every day since, I've wished I had. ,12300
Glass' finger tightens on the trigger, ready to make Bridger's wish come true. ,79000
The rest of the bunkhouse watches this execution in wide- eyed, stone silence, afraid to move. ,33900
GLASS There wasn't no `Ree that night, was there? ,2990000
A long beat, then... ,18300000
BRIDGER No. Glass PISTOL WHIPS BRIDGER, knocking him to the floor. ,151000
And before Bridger can crawl away, Glass in over him... those aching, frozen fists beating mercilessly down on Bridger. ,63
And Bridger doesn't fight back... just does his best to cover up, but the blows keep coming, and Bridger's face is covered in blood... ...just as Henry runs inside, half-dressed from where Stubby Bill awoke him. ,1870
Henry grabs Glass... pulls him off. ,1000000
Glass spins... jams his pistol right in Henry's face. 85. ,103000
HENRY Hugh. ,38300
Wait. ,18500000
Glass is crazy with rage... barely stops himself from pulling that trigger. ,27100
But finally, he calms... his arm sinks, lowering his aim. ,5840
He glances around the bunkhouse. ,730000
GLASS Where's Fitzgerald and my rifle? ,295000
HENRY Deserted two days ago. ,432000
Along with about five hundred dollars of company money. (BEAT) Let's get some coffee to warm you up. (to Glass, but looking at BRIDGER) I wanna hear what happened. ,1060
Glass looks back to Bridger... they hold a long stare, until Glass walks out. ,249000
BRIDGER Wait. ,61200
Please! But Glass and Henry disappear, leaving Bridger alone with all those eyes burning into him. ,182000
Bridger looks to Pig, but Pig just lowers his eyes... can't even look at the boy. ,214000
The men step into their boots and furs... file out after Glass and Henry... leaving Bridger alone in the bunkhouse. ,537000
INT. ROCKY MOUNTAIN FUR COMPANY OFFICE - NIGHT Glass sits by the warmth of the stove, sipping coffee. ,39900

You should go settle in. ,4120000
MURPHY There's a couple fair whores next door that'll ease the miles on ya, scars or not. ,24800
Stubby Bill gives Murphy an elbow. ,107000
ANDERSON Jesus, Murph. ,92400
MURPHY I just meant I'd go roust one of `em for ya if you wanted. ,82100
GLASS She can take the night off, but I wouldn't mind the use of her bed. ,76700
HENRY (TO MURPHY) Go clear out a room. ,8790000
The rest head on back to bunk. ,2560000
Murphy hustles out. ,9400000
The others move toward the door, each stopping to shake Glass' hand, or give him a pat on the back. ,245000
PIG I told ya I'd see ya up here. ,125000
You remember that, Hugh? ,29500000
GLASS I do, Pig. ,13200000
You must have a little gypsy in ya. ,5370000
Pig grins and nods. ,81700
PIG I'll see ya in the mornin'. ,106000
Pig exits, leaving just Glass and Henry, sitting in a beat of silence, until... ,14100
HENRY Can I talk you outta what you're planning? ,7800000
Glass doesn't answer... just stands, placing the coffee cup on the table. 87. ,2290000
GLASS Thank you for what you done for me... stitchin' me back together... givin' me a chance. ,5720000
HENRY I'm offerin' you another right now... to stay here... let this thing go. ,980000
GLASS (BEAT) He thinks he let me die. ,60000000
But he don't know that he's the one that's kept me alive... for the chance of findin' him... makin' him pay for what he done. ,5450
HENRY The law will make Fitzgerald pay. ,611000
Glass stares out the window... his SCARRED REFLECTION stares back at him. ,52100
GLASS You told me once that other men didn't think like him. (BEAT) But the truth is, most do. ,1210000
I seen it my whole life... the looks folks give... the whisperin'. ,185000
I watched my wife and son die from the fever on accounta no white doctor would care for `em. ,48400
Wasn't no different to them than if their neighbor's dog was sick. (BEAT) So I don't figure nobody's gonna care much that Fitzgerald took some dyin' nigger's rifle, and left him in the middle of nowhere. (turns to Henry) Do you, Captain? ,666
Henry doesn't answer... because he knows Glass is right. ,3520000
GLASS (CONT'D) I thank you for the coffee. ,3530000
Glass walks out. ,30400000
Henry just sits there. 88. ,EXT. FORT UNION - DAY Glass, Pig and Murphy stand by Glass' horse, as he ties off his supplies. ,85500
MURPHY He said he was goin' to get his rifle... ,938000
And then Murphy catches himself... shrugs. ,12700
MURPHY (CONT'D) Your rifle. ,134000
But he never showed back up. ,93000000
The next day I figured him mighta fell in, but then Pig seen the canoe was missin'. ,1330
PIG And the Captain found the money gone. ,21700000
GLASS I'll make my way down river. ,2020000
See what turns up. ,1040000
Glass pulls the cinch tight around the horse. ,182000
Stubby Bill comes waddling toward them. ,22000
STUBBY BILL The kid's gone... gear and all. ,12300000
Musta slipped out before light. ,98100
Stubby Bill waves Bridger's journal at them. ,2800000
STUBBY BILL (cont'd) Just left this on his bunk. ,109000
Henry takes the journal... flips it open. ,4970000
HENRY (READING) "Every day I think about what I done. ,1590000
I want to tell Pig and the others the truth but am afraid what they'll think of me. ,3600000
I look at Fitzgerald and want to kill him but am afraid to try. ,1340000
I am a coward and wish he hadn't been lyin about the Ree that night. ,12200
I wish they had come and kilt us both." Glass considers the words a beat, then swings onto his horse. 89. ,7890
GLASS If I run across the boy, I'll send him back your way. ,125000
Glass sees Henry on horseback, trotting toward them. ,62200

But maybe you won't have to. ,2
Glass stares at Henry a beat, then finally just pulls his horse around... heads for the river. ,86200
Henry nods to Pig and Murphy as he follows after Glass. ,50700
EXT. ROCK LEDGE - DAY From above Fort Union. ,191000
Our POV on Glass and Henry riding south along the icy river. ,98800
And then we see our POV is Bridger's... standing along the ledge, loaded with all his gear. ,2870
He watches the riders another moment, then turns... hikes the opposite direction... leaving Fort Union behind forever. ,7900
EXT. FORT TALBOT/GENERAL STORE - DAY The Runty Man behind the counter. ,1480000
A few of the same Trappers drinking... playing cards. ,814000
Just another day at Fort Talbot. ,265000
The door swings open, and a FUR-COVERED FIGURE enters. ,287000
RUNTY MAN We ain't got no food to spare, friend, if that's what you're lookin' for. ,11100
The figure pulls back his furs, and we see it's Fitzgerald... cold and miserable. 90. ,59300
FITZGERALD Then what the hell have ya got? ,5920000
RUNTY MAN Whiskey and blankets mostly. ,1390
Weather's held back deliveries. ,124000
Fitzgerald throws a glance to the Trappers. ,12200
FITZGERALD Gimme a couple bottles then. ,12200
Goddamn ice shredded my boat. ,175000
Been walkin' for two days. ,85600
The Runty Man hands Fitzgerald the bottles. ,211000
Fitzgerald pops one... gulps some down. ,11900
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) How much for one of them horses out there? ,173000
RUNTY MAN Horses ain't cheap this time a year. ,3770000
FITZGERALD Whatever the price, Rocky Mountain Fur Company's good for it. ,1440000
And those words stop everything. ,The Trappers all turn from their game. ,51200000
The Runty Man glares at Fitzgerald. ,55
RUNTY MAN You're the second son of a bitch come in here makin' that claim. ,206000
And the first one left a bad taste. ,10600000
FITZGERALD That right? ,7660000
Well I don't know nothin' about that. ,216000
Just that I need a horse. ,734000
RUNTY MAN So did this other fella. ,38100
So he stole one... along with Lange's pistola. ,23300
Trapper #1 nods to Fitzgerald. ,8300000
FITZGERALD Fine then, I'll pay cash for the horse. ,411000
How much? 91. ,10400000
RUNTY MAN How `bout you pay for your friend's too. ,980000
TRAPPER #1 And my shooter. ,8440000
FITZGERALD Wasn't my friend. ,631000
Trapper #1 stands up. ,8440000
TRAPPER #1 Then from where I stand, you don't got no friends at all. ,8280000
The other Trappers glare at Fitzgerald. ,19800
The Runty Man just grins that toothless smile of his. ,228000
Fitzgerald's in a bind, and he knows it. ,290000
FITZGERALD Yeah, okay. ,16200000
I'll collect from him. ,55200
How much? ,17800000
RUNTY MAN How `bout we say eighty... (sees Fitzgerald doesn't ARGUE) ...five. ,35000
Fitzgerald starts digging into his pocket. ,3370000
FITZGERALD You boys are leavin' me with nothin'. ,22100
Better be a helluva horse. ,424000
RUNTY MAN Pick of the litter. ,150000
The Runty Man snatches the cash. ,RUNTY MAN (cont'd) And when you see that scarred-up nigger, you tell him he'd best not show up here again. ,6910
Fitzgerald freezes... not sure he heard correctly. ,2020000
FITZGERALD When I see who? 92. ,4120000
RUNTY MAN The black son of a bitch that robbed me. ,You tell him that. ,5430000
A long beat, then... ,23100000
FITZGERALD Scarred up, you say... and headed up to Union? ,404000
RUNTY MAN That's what he told us. ,69100000
Seemed real anxious to get there too. ,195000
FITZGERALD (NODS) I'll make sure to give him the message when I find him. ,227000
EXT. FORT TALBOT - DAY Fitzgerald sits on the horse, staring back over the ground... his LINE OF TRACKS LEADING THROUGH THE SNOW. He turns... looks south, then back to the tracks. ,12100
Finally, Fitzgerald digs his heels into the horse. ,72800
The animal takes off, right along Fitzgerald's tracks in the snow... right back toward Glass. ,69300
EXT. MISSOURI RIVER - DAY Thick ice along the edges, tapering to a narrow stream of flowing water at the very center. ,3210
Glass and Henry ride along the snow-covered bank. ,911000
HENRY Hugh. ,38100
Henry points. ,5470
Glass follows his finger along the river... to a CANOE resting on the bank ahead. ,12000
They dismount... examine the canoe... the letters "RMFC" painted on the side. ,12200
HENRY (CONT'D) That's it. ,455000
Glass runs his mittened hand along the gashes in the wood. ,4910
GLASS Ice tore it up. 93. ,89300
Glass looks to the FOOTPRINTS IN THE SNOW, leading deep into the trees. ,117000
He glances up to the sky... clear and blue. ,140000
GLASS (CONT'D) If the snow holds off, we'll have a good trail to track. ,223000
HENRY What's out that direction? ,4890000
Talbot? ,13600000
GLASS And the Missouri. ,1090000
Doubt he'd risk the river with the `Ree. ,428000
Likely grab a horse, and cross over high... take his chances goin' east against the weather. ,6340
When'd you say he skipped out? ,12000000
HENRY Three days ago now. ,1780000
GLASS We best pick up our pace. ,24700000
They climb back onto their horses... trot into the trees. ,54500
EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - DAY Glass and Henry gallop across, their path dead on Fitzgerald's tracks. ,4640
EXT. FOREST - DAY The snow is shallow here, the ground protected by the trees. ,1030000
There's a black spot where a fire once burned, and footprints all over the place. ,208000
Glass is off his horse, crouched, studying the site... lifting the charred chunks of wood. ,34000
HENRY This was Fitzgerald camped here? ,12500
GLASS Couple nights back. ,78800
But these tracks aren't all his. ,2030000
HENRY He's travelin' with somebody? 94. ,1660000
GLASS (shakes his head) Came in after. ,30000000
Prints are smooth. ,9110000
Mocassins. ,5150000
Henry throws Glass a look... he knows what that means. ,1420000
GLASS (CONT'D) Could be Sioux... ,375000
Blackfoot even. ,1280
HENRY But you figure they're `Ree. ,4920000
GLASS I don't figure nothin', Captain. ,3300000
But whoever it is, they're a good day behind Fitzgerald. ,1250000
Glass walks, leading his horse, as he follows the tracks away from camp. ,54400
Henry rides after him. ,48100
GLASS (CONT'D) And they're on his trail too, so we should keep it quiet... don't announce we're back here. ,1240
HENRY You told me once you knew enough to keep away from the `Ree. ,3230000
GLASS I do. ,241000
HENRY You figure this is smart then? ,5050000
Glass swings up onto his horse. ,54100000
GLASS You're welcome to head back, Captain. ,293000
Glass trots off. ,14900000
Henry watches him a beat, then throws a glance into the trees... follows after Glass. ,131000
EXT. WILDERNESS/CAMP - NIGHT Glass kneels on the ground, building a fire-bed... dragging the dirt over the fire and rocks. ,12200
Henry's under a blanket, watching him. 95. ,83100
HENRY What if we find Fitzgerald... and I ask you not to do this? ,13500000
Glass spreads a blanket over the ground. ,23200000
GLASS Don't ask me. ,23100000
Glass settles in on the warm earth. ,104000
Henry just keeps watching him. ,450000
EXT. WILDERNESS/CAMP - LATER ANGLE ON HENRY... ...asleep under the blanket. ,47200
O.S. ,15800000
RUSTLING sends his eyes flashing open. ,199000
He raises up... rifle ready. ,221000
He glances at Glass, who puts a finger over his lips. ,3010000
HENRY (WHISPERS) `Ree? ,475000
Glass doesn't answer... just keeps searching the brush. ,391000
Henry's groggy eyes dart around the night... spots MOVEMENT IN THE BRUSH. HENRY (CONT'D) There! GLASS Wait! But it's too late... ,35
Henry fires... ,2110
BOOM... the shot explodes through the night... ...and the DEER leaps away. ,8710
Henry looks to Glass... shakes his head... sorry. ,3150000
HENRY So much for stayin' quiet. ,68200
CUT TO: 96. ,12400000
FITZGERALD - SQUATTING BESIDE A SMALL FIRE... ...staring out into the darkness, as the GUNSHOT ECHOES OVER HIM. Fitzgerald immediately throws dirt over the flames. ,11800
EXT. WILDERNESS/CAMP - NIGHT Glass and Henry are loaded up, back on their horses. ,11700
HENRY Guess you would've been better off on your own. ,7170000
GLASS We needed to pick up some time anyways. ,491000
The two riders disappear into the dark trees. ,2540000
EXT. WILDERNESS/CLEARING - NIGHT Glass and Henry riding across a meadow. ,63600
Glass stops... tilts his head back to sniff the air. ,280000
HENRY Whatta ya got? ,92000
GLASS Smoke. ,51400
Glass pulls some snow from his horse's mane... tosses it in the air, and watches it blow to the side. ,9320
Glass turns his horse toward the breeze... squints out into the night. ,10600
GLASS (CONT'D) No more than mile out that way. (pulls his rifle) I'll head in from the west... you take the east. ,1390
HENRY What if it's `Ree? ,55700000
GLASS Then we leave `em be... meet back up here. 97. ,754000
Henry nods... ,2710
Glass takes off at a trot. ,35200000
Henry veers the other direction... splitting up across the snow. ,4740
EXT. FOREST - NIGHT Splinters of moonlight shoot through the pines. ,5540
Glass on horseback, walking through the trees... appearing and disappearing. ,82800
He spots something in the distance... the slightest of glows. ,1440000
Glass eases off his horse... wraps the reins around a branch. ,631000
EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT Henry's already off his horse... leading it through the trees... searching as he walks. ,72600
EXT. FOREST - NIGHT Glass moves silently through the darkness... rifle poised to aim and fire... just like the first time we saw him, perfectly comfortable in this world. ,932
His eyes shine in the darkness, drifting back and forth... picking up everything. ,70700
He reaches the glow... the remains of a campfire. ,255000
The slightest bit of dying smoke rises into the air. ,86700
Glass crouches down, studying the surround ground... ,492000
HOOF-PRINTS blended in with the other tracks. ,10000
EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT Henry's horse is making too much noise with each step. ,136000
He stops walking... wraps the reins around a tree... walks back around the horse... ...AND THERE'S FITZGERALD STARING AT HIM... ...Glass' Anstadt aimed and ready to fire. ,3000
FITZGERALD Didn't figure an important man like you to be away from your stove on a night as cold as this, Captain. ,27700
You lost? ,7020000
Henry just stares back at Fitzgerald and that rifle. ,91300
His eyes drift to his own rifle, still strapped onto his saddle. 98. ,311000
HENRY I'm here to save your life. ,185000
FITZGERALD I done told you boys... ,571000
I don't need savin' by you or nobody else. ,40500000
Henry knows he's only got one chance... he makes a grab for the rifle. ,563000
EXT. FOREST - NIGHT Glass running his fingers across the tracks. ,74800
Suddenly an O.S. ,12
GUNSHOT EXPLODES IN THE DISTANCE. Glass spins to it... races back through the trees toward his horse. ,17800
EXT. FOREST - NIGHT Glass at full gallop through the woods... veering between trees... ducking branches. ,8470
EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT Glass charges from the forest... spots Henry's horse standing in the trees... tears through the snow toward it... leaps off the still-moving animal in a fluid slide... hits the ground with his rifle ready... ...and sees HENRY'S BODY face-up in the snow. ,14600
Glass drops to a knee... scans the darkness, as he slides over to Henry... ...and we see he's a bloody mess... a GUNSHOT WOUND in his chest leaking out onto the snow... ,12300
HIS HEAD SCALPED... ,15500000
LEFT EAR SLICED OFF. Glass stands back up, turning in a circle, as he peers into the distance around him. ,3760
But there's nothing out there. ,15
Glass SCREAMS in rage. ,665000
He turns back to Henry... crouches down over him. ,26300
GLASS You shouldn't a come. ,5950000
As Glass looks at Henry, he notices something... takes Henry by the chin, and tilts his head. ,2230000
And HENRY'S RIGHT EAR HAS BEEN CUT OFF AS WELL. 99. ,2700000
Glass stares at Henry a beat, then squints out into the forest. ,194000
GLASS (CONT'D) (repeating Spotted Horse's words under his breath) Arikara take right ear of Sioux. ,73
Left ear of whites. ,4210000
Not know what they take from you. ,55200000
EXT. WILDERNESS/CLEARING - NIGHT Glass on horseback, leading Henry's horse behind him across the snow-covered meadow. ,25200
Henry's fur-covered body is draped over the saddle. ,21700
EXT. FROZEN RIVER - NIGHT A thick layer of ice covers the narrow river, thinning just a bit at the center. ,3020
Glass kneels near the middle, chopping at the thick ice to get to the water beneath. ,378000
He makes a hole... dips his canteen down into it, glancing around into the darkness. ,57800
Then Glass turns... stares up a slope into the dark forest beyond... like he knows what's waiting for him there. ,5230
He walks to the horses, tied in the trees at the base of the slope... ,178000
Henry still laying across the saddle of his horse in his bloody furs. ,14200
Glass SNAPS A BRANCH FROM A FALLEN TREE... looks back up that slope. ,85500
EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT OUR POV FROM DEEP IN THE FOREST... ...watching from the shadowy brush, as Glass appears up over the distant slope... riding through the trees, with Henry draped over the horse behind. ,19
The forest is quiet... just the CRACKING of crusty snow and branches under the horses' hooves. ,5530
Then BOOM... as the ANSTADT BARREL WE HADN'T SEEN BESIDE US FLASHES IN THE NIGHT... ...and Glass tumbles off his horse. 100. ,1290
The horses prance around with a start, then settle... and then FITZGERALD RISES FROM THE BRUSH BESIDE US... eases toward the horses, reloading the Anstadt as he moves. ,71
He reaches Glass, face down in the snow... his furs covering him. ,10800
And Fitzgerald has that rifle aimed, ready for Glass to suddenly roll over firing... ...but Glass doesn't move. ,15200
Fitzgerald nudges him with his boot, then crouches down... grabs Glass by the shoulder, and pulls him over... ...and there's HENRY'S LIFELESS FACE HIDDEN BENEATH THE FURS... and that BROKEN BRANCH sticking up along his back. ,94
ANGLE FROM BEHIND HENRY'S HORSE... ...on the REST OF THE BRANCH RIGGED TO GLASS' SADDLE to hold Henry upright... ...and then what we thought was Henry flung over the second horse... ,10400
MOVING... the bloody fur-covered arm lifting a rifle... the head raising up... it's GLASS... taking aim... ...as Fitzgerald realizes what's happened... spins with the Anstadt... ...to Glass laying across the horse... rifle dead set on Fitzgerald... ,684
BOOM... ,16100000
BOOM... both rifles explode... ...Fitzgerald goes flying backward into the brush. ,677
Fitzgerald's wild shot hits Henry's horse, sending it rearing up, tossing Glass to the ground. ,31200
But Glass is on his feet in a flash... reloading as he charges into the brush... ...but FITZGERALD IS GONE. Until the flash of movement behind Glass... he turns... as the butt of the Anstadt whips through the air... ,531
WHACK... clubs him across the head, sending him tumbling down the slope to the frozen river. ,12000
Fitzgerald swings the Anstadt back over his BLOODY SHOULDER, snatches up his knife, and charges down the slope to finish Glass off. 101. ,71
EXT. FROZEN RIVER - NIGHT Glass lies on the ice, barely conscious. ,11600
Blood oozes down his head... over his eyes. ,17500000
He wipes it away to see Fitzgerald barreling down toward him. ,16700
Fitzgerald dives in attack, but Glass kicks up his leg, sending Fitzgerald flying over... ,3750
SLAMMING into the frozen river, his head CRACKING THE ICE. Glass rips the knife from his belt... moves after Fitzgerald, his feet slipping and sliding under him. ,1980
Fitzgerald rises to his feet... the men charge like two wild animals... crash into each other... knives flailing. ,107000
They roll along the ice, blades glistening... slicing through furs... across flesh. ,12200
Fitzgerald thrusts his knife down... plants it through the back of Glass' hand, pinning it to the ice. ,7560
Glass CRIES OUT... drops his own knife to pull Fitzgerald's out. ,13600
As he does, Fitzgerald kicks Glass in the face, sending him sailing back... sliding to the center of the river. ,74600
The thin ice around him splinters... cracks. ,171000
Glass looks up... sees Fitzgerald stalking toward him, HOLDING BOTH KNIVES now. ,16500
Glass is trapped... ...until he pounds his elbow down on the weakened ice... it begins to give... he pounds it again and again... ,3900
Fitzgerald speeds up to get to Glass in time... raises one of the knives, as Glass shatters the ice... drops beneath the surface. ,25900
Fitzgerald rushes after him, but the ice cracks under his feet, forcing him back. ,52100
CUT TO: UNDERWATER... ...and Glass just under the ice, floating with the current. ,155000
His fingers search for a hole, but there's nothing. ,88000
CUT TO: 102. ,225
FITZGERALD... ...making his way down the river, peering through the ice, searching for Glass. ,26400
He spots something... stops... leans close to make out the shape... it's GLASS' FEET. Then suddenly, GLASS' FIST EXPLODES THROUGH THE ICE AT FITZGERALD'S FEET... grab Fitzgerald's leg, pulling him down. ,30
Fitzgerald crashes to the ice... it splinters around him... gives away, and he sinks into the icy water... but the ANSTADT STRAPPED AROUND HIM CATCHES ON THE ICE... holds him against the current. ,35200
Glass drags himself from the water... stands... stares down at Fitzgerald trapped in the hole... his face looking up at Glass through the ice. ,8340
Glass lifts one of the fallen knives... stands over Fitzgerald. ,164000
FITZGERALD (through the water and ICE) Help me! (off Glass' stare) Glass... please! Glass hesitates a beat, staring at him, just as he did with Bridger that night in the bunkhouse. ,520
And then Glass leans down... grabs the Anstadt to pull Fitzgerald up. ,41000
Except Glass SLICES THE BLADE ACROSS THE STRAP OF THE ANSTADT, sending Fitzgerald floating away under the ice, as Glass holds on to the Anstadt. ,16
CUT TO: FITZGERALD... ...floating under the surface... pounding at the ice as he drifts, until his swinging slows... stops... his body drifts away. ,59
EXT. FROZEN RIVER - NIGHT Glass stands on the ice, blood dripping down his face, holding his Anstadt. ,16100
He begins to tremble... not from the cold, but from finally reaching the end of this journey. ,43600
His eyes begin to fill with tears... 103. ...and then he sees ELK'S TONGUE, and SEVERAL OTHER ARIKARA WARRIORS watching him from the other side of the river. ,5720
Glass and Elk's Tongue exchange a long stare, until finally Glass SCREAMS OUT. GLASS I am Tatanka Wicasa! I have killed whites and I have killed Arikara and I have killed grizzly! AND I WILL KILL YOU! Elk's Tongue doesn't move... just stares back at Glass... soaked in blood and water. ,9
Then Glass CRIES OUT at the warriors again. ,157000
GLASS (CONT'D) COME ON! But the Arikara don't attack... don't move at all... until Elk's Tongue gives Glass the SLIGHTEST OF NODS, then turns... they disappear back into the trees. ,30
Glass watches them fade away, then collapses to his knees on the icy river... exhausted in every possible way. ,12200
He begins to cry. ,20500000
FADE OUT. ,1370000

Then FLASHES OF LIGHT: for an instant we see a STORMTROOPER -- then BLACKNESS. Then ANOTHER STORMTROOPER, then it's gone. ,7420
The FLICKERING CONTINUES until the LIGHTS ARE CONSTANT. We ARE IN: INT. TROOP TRANSPORT VEHICLE - NIGHT TWENTY STORMTROOPERS. Holding on at attention, moving to the ship's rhythm, in the tense moments before a raid. ,1110
A FILTERED COMMAND and they LOCK AND LOAD their heavy blaster rifles. ,4710
The BRUTAL NOISE is replaced by SUDDEN, SHOCKING QUIET: EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT WIDE SHOT of a small, peaceful village. ,11800
Distant sounds of native animals. ,465000
A single wind chime. ,36600000
Suddenly a DROID RISES INTO FRAME, CLOSE: ROUND and SKITTERY, orange and white, this is BB-8. ,56800
Focuses on something past camera. ,846000
He BEEPS -- FAST, MORSE CODE-LIKE SOUNDS, clearly worried. ,105000
Moves EVEN CLOSER TO CAMERA -- is MORE worried -- BEEPS more -- then TURNS AND ROLLS OFF FAST -- INT. LARGE HUT - NIGHT CLOSE ON A HAND: a small LEATHER SACK is placed in the palm. ,644
The hand closes. ,21600000
Another OLDER HAND covers it. ,430000
In a primitive HUT, an old explorer, LOR SAN TEKKA, (rugged, kind) has handed the mysterious sack to POE DAMERON (32, in a pilot's jacket). ,14
Poe has charisma, a natural spark: LOR SAN TEKKA This will begin to make things right. ,45000
I've traveled too far, and seen too much, to ignore the despair in the galaxy. ,127000
Without the Jedi, there can be no balance in the Force. ,3750000
POE Well, because of you now we have a chance. ,7160000
The General's been after this for a long time. ,298000
LOR SAN TEKKA "The General." To me, she's royalty. ,24000000
Well, she certainly is that. ,589000
POE BB-8 ENTERS FRANTIC, BEEPS. Concerned, Poe turns to Lor San Tekka. ,8070
POE (CONT'D) We've got company. ,61500000
EXT. LARGE HUT - NIGHT The men exit fast. ,2070000
Poe moves TO CAMERA, raises QUADNOCULARS. POE'S POV: LIGHTS on the horizon -- approaching ENEMY SHIPS. POE lowers the quadnocs -- PUSH IN ON HIS UNNERVED EYES. A GROWING, FRIGHTENING THUNDER. POE You have to hide. ,7
LOR SAN TEKKA You have to leave. ,48500000
Go! Poe turns to him. ,4200000
Conflicted. ,990000
Finally nods, hurries off. ,448000
BB-8 follows. ,767
EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT TRACK FAST with Poe as he and BB-8 hurry through the village, various ARMED VILLAGERS taking position, prepared to defend. ,48
EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT A ROAR of WIND and DUST: the TRANSPORTS LAND. Stormtroopers come out FIRING BLASTERS -- the VILLAGERS FIRE BACK -- many are HIT! EXT. RISE ADJACENT TO VILLAGE - NIGHT Poe runs to an X-WING fighter, parked at a distance from the village, hidden behind a ROCK OUTCROPPING. POE Come on, BB-8! Hurry! Poe sends BB-8 into the droid socket / co-pilot seat -- he moves to the cockpit -- the CONTROLS COME TO LIFE. As the CANOPY CLOSES, Poe shoots a quick look back: the ENEMY ARRIVES IN THE DISTANCE. Poe urgently works the controls -- BB-8 BEEPS. The X-WING LANDING LIGHTS COME ON, ENGINES WHINE TO LIFE! But just then: Poe's ship is suddenly HIT BY BLASTERFIRE! Poe turns to look: two STORMTROOPERS CHARGE HIS WAY, FIRING! POE (CONT'D) I see 'em! BB-8 BEEPS nervously as Poe GRABS HIS CONTROLS and FIRES AT THEM, using the X-wing's drop-down antipersonnel blaster! The two Troopers are BLOWN AWAY in the large BLAST HITS! Poe tries to start the ship now, but the ENGINES SPUTTER. Concerned, he opens his canopy, jumps down, moves to the back of his ship: BAD DAMAGE ON THE REAR ENGINE PANEL. They're in trouble. ,EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT Lor San Tekka moves sadly through the village as STORMTROOPERS wielding FLAME THROWERS destroy structures. ,6
Surrendering Villagers are ROUNDED UP. Penned ANIMALS panic. ,12200
EXT. RISE ADJACENT TO THE VILLAGE - NIGHT Back at the X-wing, Poe kneels beneath his ship, pulls from the leather sack a SMALL, OLD ARTIFACT which he inserts into BB-8 -- the droid's MULTI-READER ENVELOPS it. ,19
POE You take this. ,7
It's safer with you than it is with me. ,78900000
You get as far away from here as you can. ,4720000
Do you hear me? (BB-8 BEEPS, hesitates) I'll come back for you! It will be alright. ,21600
BB-8 watches Poe run off. ,638000
BEEP-WHINES nervously, then turns and heads off. ,13900
Turns back once to look at Poe, then ROLLS AWAY. Poe uses his blaster rifle to fire at incoming troopers from cover. ,31200
EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT The Troopers and villagers in battle -- as one Trooper is HIT and goes down. ,13500
Another -- OUR TROOPER -- KNEELS to help. ,14200
The hit trooper raises a torn, bloody glove -- his HUMAN HAND visible -- and MARKS OUR STORMTROOPER'S MASK WITH BLOOD just before he dies. ,29
Our Trooper, stands -- overwhelmed by the battle. ,12400
AN IMPOSING SHUTTLE CRAFT -- VERTICAL WINGSPAN 90 FEET TALL -- LANDS NEAR THE TRANSPORT VEHICLES. The shuttle craft door OPENS -- through the wind and smoke, KYLO REN exits the ship: a TALL, DARK FIGURE, he strides through the chaos toward San Tekka. ,7
A senior Trooper moves to our blood-marked Trooper, and orders HIM: SENIOR TROOPER Stay here. ,8510
Our Trooper nods. ,39500
Kylo Ren stops before the outraged Lor San Tekka, dwarfing him. ,1500
Only now does it become apparent that Kylo Ren wears a DARK MASK, marked by battle. ,23300
Inset metal lines reflect FIRE. KYLO REN Look how old you've become. ,4100
LOR SAN TEKKA Something far worse has happened to you. ,122000
Our blood-marked TROOPER is placed in line with other stormtroopers. ,5310
KYLO REN You know what I've come for. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: LOR SAN TEKKA I know where you come from. ,389000
Before you called yourself Kylo Ren. ,1570000
KYLO REN The map to Skywalker. ,146000
We know you've found it, and now you're going to give it to the First Order. ,2840000
Adjacent to the village, Poe enters frame -- sees the Ren/San Tekka exchange continue. ,16400
LOR SAN TEKKA The First Order rose from the dark side... you did not. ,209000
KYLO REN I'll show you the dark side. ,3710000
LOR SAN TEKKA You may try, but you cannot deny the truth that is your family. ,5650
Suddenly Kylo Ren raises his LIGHTSABER -- IGNITES IT -- PERPENDICULAR SMALLER BLADES AT THE HILT, A UNIQUE BUZZ -- YELLOW/RED ENERGY, SPITTING SPARKS AND SMOKE -- KYLO REN You're so right. ,29
And as he RIPS IT DOWN ACROSS SAN TEKKA! Poe, RUNNING, SEES THIS AND YELLS, AIMS HIS BLASTER AND FIRES AT KYLO REN! Instantly: Kylo Ren RAISES HIS HAND -- POE'S BLAST FREEZES -- THE BOLT OF ENERGY STRAINING AND VIBRATING IN MID AIR! Kylo Ren sees Poe, who suddenly CANNOT MOVE, but strains to. ,10
He is grabbed by Stormtroopers who drag him past the VIBRATING, FROZEN BLAST, to Kylo Ren. ,2100
A Stormtrooper begins a brutal PAT DOWN. Kylo Ren moves closer. ,12700
Poe just glares. ,10700000
The Stormtrooper KICKS OUT Poe's legs -- he lands hard on his knees. ,49000
Kylo Ren kneels to look at Poe. ,8580
POE So who talks first? ,700000
You talk first? ,74100000
KYLO REN The old man gave it to you. ,156000
POE (INDICATES KYLO'S MASK) It's just very hard to understand you with all the... (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: KYLO REN (TO TROOPERS) Search him. ,1650
POE ... ,14300000
Apparatus. ,12700000
The Troopers roughly pull Poe away. ,165000
A Stormtrooper begins a brutal PAT DOWN. Kylo Ren moves closer. ,17700
Poe just glares as the pat down ends. ,392000
STORMTROOPER #1 Nothing, sir. ,3360000
KYLO REN Put him on board. ,7590000
Kylo Ren regards the Stormtroopers with the rounded up Villagers, then turns to the CHROME-SKINNED, FEMALE BLACK- CAPED HEAD STORMTROOPER, CAPTAIN PHASMA. CAPTAIN PHASMA Sir, the villagers. ,11
KYLO REN Kill them all. ,395000
Phasma nods, steps forward: CAPTAIN PHASMA On my command! The Troopers, including OURS, aim at the Villagers. ,776
CAPTAIN PHASMA (CONT'D) Fire! Poe is roughly PULLED into a transport ship, the ramp LIFTS. All around our Trooper BLASTERFIRE ERUPTS -- but we're WIDE ENOUGH to see he ISN'T FIRING. PUSH IN until the FIRING STOPS. All the Stormtroopers SPREAD OUT TO SEARCH -- except ours. ,3
Kylo Ren heads back toward his ship. ,62700
But then he STOPS. Feels something. ,4840000
TURNS AND LOOKS AT OUR STORMTROOPER for a LONG MOMENT. Our Trooper can barely meet his gaze; knows he's doomed. ,8250
Kylo Ren then heads off -- passes the FROZEN BLAST, which, after a beat, GOES FREE AND SLAMS INTO A NEARBY STRUCTURE, scaring the hell out of our Stormtrooper. ,1560
EXT. EDGE OF JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT A Stormtrooper climbs down from the cockpit of Poe's X-wing, BACKS AWAY: (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: STORMTROOPER #2 Nothing here. ,2450
Go ahead! Three other Stormtroopers FIRE LASER CANNONS at the X-wing -- destroying the ship in a LARGE EXPLOSION. EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT BB-8 rolls across the sand, looks back: the X-wing FIREBALL. BB-8, afraid, continues on his own in a mysterious, dark desert. ,5
We see a FORM -- an animal, its RED EYES LIFTING from the sand, watching the rolling droid, who just keeps going. ,13600
In a WIDE SHOT, we HEAR HIM BEEPING to himself, lonely and frightened. ,2830000
EXT. SPACE - NIGHT With the SANDY PLANET OF JAKKU as backdrop, Troop Transports and Kylo Ren's Shuttle approach a massive STAR DESTROYER. INT. STAR DESTROYER HANGAR - NIGHT Poe, shackled, is ushered from the transport through the hangar. ,4
He is awed by the imposing space. ,115000
POE All right. ,755000
All right! Our Stormtrooper passes, moves fast: INT. TROOP TRANSPORT VEHICLE - NIGHT Our Stormtrooper enters the dark, vehicle. ,784
He removes his helmet. ,129000
His head comes up and we PUSH IN ON HIS FACE FOR THE FIRST TIME. This is FN-2187. ,1860000
He is 23, likable. ,22000000
But in this moment, terrified, desperate. ,61700
After a beat, behind him, CAPTAIN PHASMA enters. ,1570000
FN-2187 knows he's in trouble. ,3450000
CAPTAIN PHASMA FN-2187. ,4840000
Submit your blaster for inspection. ,1130000
FN-2187 Yes, Captain. ,71100
CAPTAIN PHASMA And who gave you permission to remove that helmet? ,102000
FN-2187 I'm sorry, Captain. ,12300
CAPTAIN PHASMA Report to my division at once. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: Phasma heads off. ,1240
Shattered, FN-2187 replaces his helmet. ,24400
CUT TO: INT. JUNKED VESSEL CORRIDOR - DAY A metal sheet is pulled open to reveal the wrapped up face of A SCAVENGER, perhaps alien, in GOGGLES, FACE MASK and GLOVES. Backpack with a STAFF strapped to it. ,8760
Uses TOOLS to remove various MECHANISMS from inside the wall. ,1720000
We are in an upside-down, canted CORRIDOR. The Scavenger finds a valuable piece, drops it in a SATCHEL. Swings the bag back and begins CLIMBING DOWN on a cable, between treacherous WALLS OF MACHINERY, headed to: INT. JUNKED VESSEL - LARGER SPACE - LATER Alone and tiny in this massive, sideways wreck, the Scavenger descends, climbing down a two-hundred foot-long cable. ,10
LANDS HARD onto rusty metal. ,168000
INT. JUNKED VESSEL - ENGINES - DAY The Scavenger carries the satchel and another large, found piece, over enormous pipes in the vast space, heads through the dust toward a distant SLIT OF SUNLIGHT. EXT. JUNKED VESSEL ENGINE - DAY The Scavenger arrives from the darkness and pulls off goggles and gear, revealing the grimy face of a beautiful, young WOMAN. This is REY, 19. ,58
She opens her canteen, shakes out the two final drops into her mouth. ,12300
HITS THE SIDE of the canteen again and again for whatever she can get. ,52000
CUT WIDE: Rey is rendered minuscule, standing at the bottom of an EPIC ENGINE OF A DECAYING, CRASHED STAR DESTROYER -- DISTANT SOUND of her canteen-hitting. ,4940
She sets her things on a piece of sheet metal and sits next to it, sliding down the sand dune. ,13200
She RIDES DOWN THE MOUNTAIN OF SAND. WE HOLD FOR A LONG TIME, looking down, as she recedes from us, toward the distant SALT FLATS below. ,19700
Random SCATTERED DEBRIS. Her SPEEDER, tiny from here. ,363000
Rey moves to her junker SPEEDER, jumps on, fires the sputtery engine and DRIVES OFF. EXT. DESERT - SPACESHIP GRAVEYARD - DAY Rey races along the desert floor: a GRAVEYARD OF CRASHED SPACESHIPS. EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY Rey's speeder PASSES us, heading for a dusty, desert town. ,2
Refueling, small trade, scavengers. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: CRASH! Rey's sack carrying her heavy FOUND OBJECTS hits the sand. ,1870
Working like a tough seaman, Rey hauls the sack from her speeder toward the town. ,1270
EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - CLEANING TABLE - DAY TIGHT ON REY'S HANDS as she SCRUBS CLEAN her day's salvage. ,6710
Rey glances up: she looks at an old woman, also cleaning some salvage. ,909000
Rey watches her, gets lost in the simple moment. ,177000
A small, passing alien UNDERLING barks something to her in another language. ,26
She returns to work. ,300000
INT. NIIMA TRADING STRUCTURE - DAY Rey looks up to a SERVICE WINDOW: two feet above her, behind a protective screen, is her boss, UNKAR PLUTT (50, blobfish, unclean). ,11
He examines her pieces. ,311000
Then he offers: UNKAR What you've brought me today is worth... ,1160000
Hmmm... ,2020000
One quarter portion. ,2540000
Though disappointed, Rey barely shows it. ,104000
She nods thanks. ,4910
Unkar pushes through his transfer drawer a SEALED PACKET: DRIED GREEN MEAT in one section, BEIGE POWDER in another. ,1220
She takes it. ,728000
She swallows her resentment and heads off. ,4
EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY The IMMENSE SETTING SUN against the FLAT TERRAIN. Rey's SPEEDER races, almost insignificant, across frame. ,7
INT. REY'S DWELLING - DAY She SCRATCHES MARKS into the rusty wall. ,3530000
Another MARK; another DAY. And there are THOUSANDS of marks. ,5220000
A SIZZLING SOUND over: A DRIED DESERT FLOWER in a rusty ENGINE PIECE. A rough, stuffed HANDMADE DOLL, made from what looks like orange Rebellion flight suit material and twine. ,17
Rey's lonely, ramshackle dwelling. ,12600
Everything reclaimed. ,2750
She cooks for one. ,6390000
Does everything for one. ,50600000
She opens the POWDER, moves to the makeshift WOK, where the GREEN MEAT SIZZLES. Pours the powder into milky WATER in a tin. ,1060
Stirs it. ,663000
It GROWS INTO A LOAF as she puts the meat on an old plate. ,758000
Grabs the loaf. ,65700
EXT. REY'S DWELLING - DUSK Rey sits, eats like a starving child. ,27900
Every last drop. ,11600000
Licks the metal plate. ,6900000
Looks out at the horizon. ,39800000
A single silent ship heads off, a shimmering, thin contrail. ,14500
She wipes her mouth. ,335000
Picks up an old, broken REBELLION HELMET. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: just 'cause. ,25900
Puts it on, WIDE SHOT of Rey sitting, alone and isolated, on the leg of an ANCIENT, FALLEN AT-AT in which she lives. ,54200
Then, a distant ELECTRONIC SQUEAL -- instantly she's up, helmet too big, she rips it off. ,8080
Hears ANOTHER BEEPING SQUEAL. She hurries to her QUARTERSTAFF and runs off. ,2720
Rey climbs a dune. ,117000
RISE WITH HER, revealing BB-8, caught in a NET but fighting back, being held by a TEEDO (a small, brutish desert tyrant), who rides a LUGGABEAST. The teedo YELLS at BB-8, who BEEPS madly, struggling to free himself. ,3
Rey watches this injustice for a beat, finally YELLING OUT: REY Tal'ama parqual! The Teedo and BB-8 STOP, GO SILENT, turn to her. ,4
REY (CONT'D) Parqual zatana! A half beat and the Teedo YELLS SOMETHING BACK, threatening. ,4
BB-8's head swivels to him, then back to Rey, like watching a tennis match. ,49600
Rey angrily moves to them, pulling a knife from her pouch. ,26100
Rey starts CUTTING BB-8 out of the netting. ,398000
The Teedo freaks out, YELLING. Rey suddenly stands, turns to the Teedo and says, fiercely: REY (CONT'D) NOMA. The Teedo barks a sort of "AHHHHH!" (As if to say, "GO TO HELL!"), Then heads off on his beast. ,7
This prompts BB-8 to start BEEP-YELLING at the departing bully, provocatively. ,20100
REY (CONT'D) Shhhh. ,42
BB-8 quiets instantly. ,26600
The two watch the Teedo head off. ,79600000
Finally, BB-8 BEEPS a question. ,188000
She KNEELS to him. ,443000
REY (CONT'D) That's just Teedo. ,37
Wants you for parts. ,36900000
He has no respect for anyone. ,252000
Your antenna's bent. (considers BB-8 for the first time, STRAIGHTENS THE ANTENNA) Where do you come from? (BB-8 BEEPS) Classified. ,1640
Really? ,19100000
Me too. ,8120000
Big secret. (points to horizon) Niima Outpost is that way, stay off Kelvin Ridge. (MORE) (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: REY (CONT'D) Keep away from the Sinking Fields in the north, you'll drown in the sand. (stands, heads off) BB-8 starts after her, BEEPS. She turns sharply, he stops. ,REY (CONT'D) Don't follow me. ,426000
Town is that way. (he BEEPS again) No! She heads off again. ,1480000
Finally he BEEPS to her -- something SWEET this time. ,214000
That he is alone, scared, has no one else. ,1030000
This makes her stop. ,892000
She turns and looks at him. ,10700000
Not liking him. ,43100
But a gesture of her head says, reluctantly, "Come on." BB-8 quickly moves to her. ,505000
They head off together. ,37600000
REY (CONT'D) In the morning, you go. (HE BEEPS) You're welcome. ,11200
The two disappear behind a dune. ,3750000
EXT. STAR DESTROYER - DAY Three TIE fighters head to the massive ship high above Jakku. ,80500
INT. STAR DESTROYER HOLDING CELL - DAY POE, shackled to a chair, BEATEN, wakes up. ,3440
KYLO REN I had no idea we had the best pilot in the Resistance on board. ,322000
Comfortable? ,15200000
Through battered lips: POE Not really. ,11800
KYLO REN I'm impressed. ,4030000
No one has been able to get out of you what you did with the map. ,31600000
POE Might wanna rethink your technique. ,17000
Kylo Ren says nothing, reaches out to him. ,1440000
Poe flinches in the chair as Kylo Ren reaches for his face, not touching him. ,106000
Poe is soon in agony, remains in horrible silence -- KYLO REN Where is it? (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: POE The Resistance will not be intimidated by you. ,3480
KYLO REN Where... is it? ,1650000
Poe can't take it -- he BEGINS TO SCREAM and we CUT TO: INT. STAR DESTROYER CORRIDOR - DAY WHOOOSH! The cell door SLIDES UP. Kylo Ren exits, fierce, confronts GENERAL HUX (34, scary) who awaits him: KYLO REN It's in a droid. ,6
A BB unit. ,14900000
GENERAL HUX Well then. ,41700
If it's on Jakku, we'll soon have it. ,7100000
KYLO REN I leave that to you. ,2550000
EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY BB-8 is dropped to the sand. ,52300
REY Don't give up. ,192000
He still might show up. ,39400000
Whoever it is you're waiting for. ,2480000
Classified. ,16400000
I know all about waiting. ,79500000
BB-8 BEEPTALKS a question. ,18
REY (CONT'D) For my family. ,174000
They'll be back. ,8300000
One day. ,15200000
Come on. ,14300000
She tries to force a smile, but can't, really. ,438000
She heads off. ,424000
BB-8 BEEPS... then heads after her. ,1060000
INT. NIIMA TRADING STRUCTURE - DAY Rey stands with BB-8 in front of Unkar Plutt, at his window. ,6080
He reviews her goods. ,41600000
He glances quickly at BB-8. ,208000
UNKAR These five pieces are worth... ,2640000
Let me see here... ,992000
One half portion. ,16600
REY (OBJECTS) Last week they were a half portion each. ,350000
She hates him. ,2870000
He leans forward. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: UNKAR What about the droid? ,12300
REY What about him? ,7460000
UNKAR I'll pay for him. ,135000
BB-8 doesn't like this at all. ,11900000
Rey is awkward, but curious. ,22200
UNKAR (CONT'D) Sixty portions. ,12300
CLOSE ON HER. Stunned. ,17000000
Literally hungry for this amount of food, her stomach practically rumbles. ,429000
BB-8 sees her interest and BEEPS furiously, not liking this conversation at all. ,10900
She looks at Unkar. ,2150000
Looks down at BB-8. ,54900000
Considers it all. ,28100000
Finally, she hears herself say: REY Actually... the droid's not for sale. (TO BB-8) Come on. ,24900
Unkar furious. ,7
Rey, then BB-8, head out. ,72900000
Recovering, Unkar watches her go with dark eyes. ,1110000
He picks up a communicator: UNKAR Follow the girl and get that droid. ,767000
He SLAMS the service window door SHUT. INT. STAR DESTROYER HOLDING CELL - DAY The cell door WHOOSHES OPEN -- a STORMTROOPER enters. ,68
Poe remains shackled, worse for wear. ,14100
A TROOPER GUARD here. ,1210000

TIGHT ON POE, in pain, drained, as the Guard unshackles him. ,94900

POE (COMING TO) If -- what--? ,1950000
The Stormtrooper pulls off his helmet: IT IS FN-2187. ,28600
FN-2187 This is a rescue, I'm helping you escape. ,9420000
Can you fly a TIE fighter? ,64800
POE You with the Resistance--?! FN-2187 What? (THAT'S CRAZY) No no no! I'm breaking you out. ,46200
Can you fly a TIE fighter? ,129000
POE I can fly anything. ,486000
Why, why are you helping me? ,3180000
FN-2187 Because it's the right thing to do. ,4660000
POE (it hits him) You need a pilot. ,954000
FN-2187 I need a pilot. ,1480000
And Poe, seeing this is for real, smiles a hero's smile. ,410000
POE We're gonna do this. ,3660000
FN-2187 (unsure but hopeful) ... ,5090
INT. STAR DESTROYER HANGAR - DAY WIDE SHOT ESTABLISHING the hangar. ,14100
Find FN-2187, again masked, walking with Poe. ,7370
By all appearances he's escorting a prisoner. ,310000
A group of OFFICERS passes in the opposite direction. ,943000
FN-2187 Okay, stay calm, stay calm. ,150000
POE I am calm. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: FN-2187 I'm talking to myself. (BEAT) Not yet. ,18400
Okay, go. ,103000

FN-2187 pulls off his helmet as Poe removes his cuffs and jacket, fires up the ship with excitement. ,68
POE I always wanted to fly one of these things. ,438000
Can ya shoot? ,2110000
FN-2187 Blasters, I can! POE Okay, same principal! Use the toggle on the left to switch between missiles, cannons, and mag pulse -- use the site on the right to aim, triggers to fire! FN-2187 This is very complicated FWOOOOOOM! The TIE FIGHTER LURCHES FORWARD -- POE I can fix this. ,8
INT. HANGAR SIX CONTROL ROOM - DAY WIDE: see the ship STRUGGLE TO RISE, CABLES connected to it -- PULL BACK FAST to REVEAL we're inside the main control room. ,903

EXT. JAKKU DESERT - DAY TIGHT ON FINN'S FACE: His EYES OPEN. He goes from unconscious to terrified, fast. ,4080
He sits up, looks around. ,4280000
CUT BACK WIDE: he sits in the middle of an EPIC DESERT, DUNES FOREVER. A BLACK CHUTE blows in the wind behind him, scattered debris. ,32200
Then he sees, over distant dunes, RISING BLACK SMOKE. He gets up -- moves toward it, calling out: FINN Poe! Poe! Finn scrambles over the massive dune to the TIE FIGHTER, SMOKING AND ON FIRE, small debris around it. ,97
He thinks he sees POE'S ARM -- he pulls on it, but it's JUST POE'S JACKET. He throws that off and tries to find a way in -- even a way to LOOK INSIDE, but the smoke and heat make it impossible. ,38400
FINN (CONT'D) Poe!!! POE! Suddenly the ship BEGINS TO SINK -- like it's being CONSUMED INTO QUICKSAND -- Finn is slipping in too -- FINN (CONT'D) POE!!! POE!!! It becomes clear fast: if Finn doesn't get away, he's gonna get sucked in too! So Finn scampers away from the TIE FIGHTER as it SINKS INTO THE SAND! We're in the Sinking Fields. ,8
A few moments and IT'S GONE. Finn's out of breath. ,298000
Horrified. ,1050000
Then A GIANT EXPLOSION ERUPTS FROM below, SENDING SAND AND DEBRIS EVERYWHERE! Finn sees this, disoriented, scared, exhausted and defeated. ,11800
And all alone. ,748000
EXT. DESERT - DAY ENDLESS DUNES BEHIND HIM, Finn walks, removing pieces of his Stormtrooper gear, using Poe's FLIGHT JACKET for shade. ,7650
EXT. DESERT - DAY Exhausted, Finn continues his trek across the endless, sandy nothingness. ,660
EXT. DESERT - DAY Finn, parched and losing hope, he walks to the edge of a massive dune, looks out into the epic valley below. ,2240
Miles ahead: NIIMA OUTPOST. INT. STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE - DAY General Hux and Kylo Ren walk the length of the bridge. ,4
GENERAL HUX Supreme Leader Snoke was explicit. ,42700
Capture the droid if we can, but destroy it if we must. ,2190000
KYLO REN How capable are your soldiers, General? ,80600
GENERAL HUX (WITH VITRIOL) I won't have you question my methods. ,3030
KYLO REN They're obviously skilled at committing high treason. ,11800
Perhaps Leader Snoke should consider using a clone army. ,3580000
GENERAL HUX (YOU SON-OF-A-BITCH) My men are exceptionally trained -- programmed from birth-- KYLO REN Then they should have no problem retrieving the droid. ,43
Unharmed. ,710000
GENERAL HUX Careful, Ren. ,215000
That your "personal interests" not interfere with orders from Leader Snoke. ,2940000
KYLO REN I want that map. ,12200000
For your sake, I suggest you get it. ,5640000
Ren heads off. ,2830000
Hux hates him. ,2790000
EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY Sun-scorched and exhausted, Finn stumbles out of the desert into the Outpost. ,51
In a heatstroke daze he moves past enormous old SHIP PARTS, MERCHANTS, SCAVENGERS and TENTED STALLS. FINN Water... water... water.. ,5
He sees a WATER TROUGH where a filthy, slobbering hippo-like creature (a HAPPABORE) DRINKS. Finn moves to it, uses his hands to desperately DRINK the filthy water. ,36
After a couple swallows he SPITS IT OUT, disgusted. ,112000
FINN (CONT'D) -- Awgh, GAH! But he's parched and immediately RETURNS FOR MORE. ACROSS THE MARKETPLACE, REY kneels with an emphatically BEEPING BB-8. ,3
Just then, TWO of UNKAR'S THUGS approach and stop her. ,167000
One clearly tells her that they're taking the droid. ,1310000
BB-8 reacts nervously as Rey resists them -- one pulls a SACK over BB-8 while the other grabs Rey's arm -- in the tussle, Rey KNOCKS OVER METAL URNS for sale -- Finn, still drinking, is PUSHED OVER by the happabore. ,14
He falls to the ground, then turns to look when he HEARS CRASHING. He sees, through the tents, REY FIGHTING. He moves UP CLOSER to help this young woman being accosted -- but he STOPS when Rey begins to FIGHT BACK -- scrappy and feral, she KICKS, BITES and HITS. Finn is taken aback as she DEFEATS the attackers, who hit the sand, hard. ,42
Finn just watches, stunned. ,1010000
Rey moves to the COVERED BB-8 -- PULLS THE SACK OFF OF HIM. Finn cannot believe his eyes. ,76500
IT'S POE'S DROID! Rey talks to BB-8, who, nervous now, looks around and... ,29200
SEES FINN! BB-8 STARTS BEEPING like crazy. ,10000
Then something insane happens: REY LOOKS AT FINN. REY (To BB-8) Who? ,419000
Him? ,19000000
Finn is confused. ,8430000
Rey stands, staring at Finn, defiant. ,81300
Finn can feel trouble coming -- and Rey begins CHARGING AT HIM, quarterstaff in hand. ,637
Realizing he's the target, Finn begins to RUN -- away from her, through the tent marketplace. ,8910
Rey goes after him -- he turns a corner -- then another -- then BAM! She's got ahead of him and SLAMS HIM TO THE GROUND WITH HER STAFF! Finn is on his back, out of breath and freaked out. ,36400
She holds the staff on him threateningly: REY What's your hurry, thief? ,217000
FINN What--?! Thief? ,11300000
BB-8 ROLLS UP FAST, MOVES TO FINN -- a WELDING ARM TELESCOPES FROM HIS BODY AND SHOCKS FINN! FINN (CONT'D) OW! HEY! What?! REY The jacket! This droid says you stole it! FINN I've had a pretty messed up day, alright?! So I'd appreciate it you stop accusing me -- OW!!! (BB-8 has ZAPPED him AGAIN) STOP IT! REY Where'd you get it? ,21
It belongs to his master. ,3300000
Finn looks at her -- then the agitated droid, Finn's mind racing. ,22700
He puts it all together. ,588000
Frustrated, but sighs heavily, needing to respond somehow. ,27200
So he makes a hard decision: to tell the truth. ,2330000
FINN It belonged to Poe Dameron. ,175000
That was his name, right? ,72000000
Rey and BB-8 react, surprised and wanting more. ,16400
FINN (CONT'D) He was captured... by the First Order! I helped him escape but our ship crashed. (RELIVING IT) Poe didn't make it. (sees BB-8 is sad, ROLLS OFF) Look, I tried to help him. ,40
I'm sorry... ,34700000
BB-8 heads off to the side, depressed. ,71900
Rey watches BB-8, then considers Finn again. ,506000
Says, a bit impressed: REY So you're with the Resistance? (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: Finn's mind races again. ,58900
He makes an easy decision: to lie. ,1650000
FINN Obviously. ,I am. ,I'm with the Resistance, yeah. (WHISPERS) I'm with the Resistance. ,Rey lowers her staff, Finn stands. ,Rey studies him: REY I've never met a Resistance fighter before. ,FINN Well, this is what we look like. ,Some of us. ,Others look different. ,REY BB-8 says he's on a secret mission, he has to get back to your base. ,FINN Apparently he's carrying a map that leads to Luke Skywalker, and everyone's after it. ,She turns to him, concerned, curious. ,And asks: REY Luke Skywalker? ,I thought he was a myth. ,Just then BB-8 BEEPS MADLY at something he sees. ,REY (CONT'D) What is it? ,Rey moves to him, peeks around a tent corner. ,Now Finn moves to see: at a distance, TWO STORMTROOPERS TALKING TO UNKAR'S THUGS -- who POINT THEIR WAY! Finn urgently grabs her hand and heads for the tents: REY (CONT'D) (re: her hand) What are you doing?! FINN Come on! Suddenly LASER BLASTS RIP PAST THEM, HIT THE CLEANING UNIT, SPEWING STEAM! Rey SCREAMS -- MORE BLASTS as they run! EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY Finn and Rey holding hands, the three race, ZIGZAGGING through a maze of tents: (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: FINN Come on, BB-8! REY Let go of me! FINN No, we gotta move! REY (pulls her hand back) I know how to run without you holding my hand! BB-8 stay close! This way! Now Finn and BB-8 follow Rey -- ANOTHER BLAST just missing them! They disappear through a tent. ,TRACK FAST WITH STORMTROOPERS, through the tent maze. ,They come out of a tent, HAVING MOMENTARILY LOST THEIR TARGET. STORMTROOPER Call in the air strike! REY, FINN AND BB-8 duck into another tent: INT. NIIMA OUTPOST - TENT - DAY Rey, Finn and BB-8 move through RUSTY WARES and take cover. ,Quiet, urgent: REY They're shooting at both of us! FINN Yeah, they saw you with me! You're marked! REY Well, thanks for that! FINN I'm not the one who chased you down with a stick! Does anyone have blasters around here?! REY (TO BB-8) Are you okay? ,Finn QUIETS HER WITH A GESTURE, HEARING SOMETHING. PUSH IN ON FINN -- whatever he hears alarms him greatly -- he GRABS HER HAND AGAIN -- PULLS HER AWAY -- REY (CONT'D) Stop taking my hand! EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - TENT - DAY Finn pulls Rey from the tent -- BB-8 FOLLOWS -- As they race from the tent a TIE FIGHTER SCREAMS INTO VIEW FROM BEHIND THE TENTS! A SECOND FOLLOWS CLOSE BEHIND. IT FIRES AT THEM -- A MASSIVE BLAST SENDS REY AND FINN FLYING -- BB-8 ROLLING! WIDE SHOT: TWO TIE FIGHTERS SCREAM OVER the town, the EXPLOSION throws sand and debris fifty feet into the air. ,Rey is thrown HARD to the ground -- she is rattled, truly afraid. ,Then she turns: FINN lies nearby, unconscious. ,Suddenly afraid, she scrambles to him, rolls him over. ,BB-8 ROLLS OVER, BEEPING in concern. ,REY Hey! As Finn comes to, he sees her. ,Through his fog: FINN -- Are you okay? ,And that very question touches her -- having never in her life been asked it. ,REY Yeah. (extends her hand) Follow me. ,Grateful, Finn takes it. ,They're off. ,LOCALS run amok as TIE fighters DIVE BOMB. REY, Finn and BB- 8 SPRINT, BLASTER EXPLOSIONS GET CLOSER AND CLOSER! EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - SPACEPORT - DAY Rey, STAFF strapped to her back, leads the way as she, Finn and BB-8 race into the spaceport. ,Finn glances back: TWO TIE FIGHTERS BANK their return. ,They YELL: FINN We can't outrun them! Rey POINTS to a parked, four-engine SHIP ahead: REY We might in that quad-jumper! FINN We need a pilot! REY We've got one! (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: FINN You?! (then, indicates one OFF-CAMERA) What about that ship? ,REY That one's garbage! They run for the JUMPER but the passing TIE FIGHTERS FIRE AT IT, BLOWING IT APART IN A HUGE FLAME BALL! Rey, coming to a quick stop, RIGHT UP TO CAMERA: REY (CONT'D) The garbage'll do! She turns and runs back -- Finn and BB-8 follow as they all run toward the piece of junk -- and we see it for the first time: THE MILLENNIUM FALCON! TIE fighters BANK AROUND AGAIN. Finn, Rey and BB-8 run up the ramp of the semi-tarped Falcon. ,INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY Finn, Rey and BB-8 enter the ship -- she hits a control and the door DESCENDS CLOSED as she races to the cockpit: REY Gunner position's down there! FINN (CLIMBS DOWN) Y'ever fly this thing? ,INT.

Finn SWINGS into frame, trying to work the GUNS. FINN Whoa! Hey! Oh! Stay low! Stay low! REY WHAT? FINN Stay low! It confuses their tracking! For a crazy instant Rey LETS GO OF THE YOKE, stretches to the co-pilot controls -- THE FALCON CANTS! REY BB-8, hold on! Rey finally REACHES the switches, returns to the yoke, stabilizing the ship, afraid of this next move. ,REY I'M GOING LOW!!! EXT. DESERT - DAY BEHIND THE FALCON as it DRAMATICALLY BANKS AT AN UPWARD ARC, UPSIDE-DOWN, then SWOOPS PERILOUSLY LOW across the sand. ,Two TIE FIGHTERS SCREAM past us! INT.

And... ,63400000
INT. MAZ'S CASTLE - MAIN ROOM - DAY We ENTER THE LOUD, CROWDED MESS of a hall -- PUSHING PAST a room full of rough and odd ALIENS AND HUMANS, who gamble, drink, scheme, negotiate, argue -- until we end up on the BACK of a tiny, thousand year-old, four foot tall ALIEN, who suddenly STARTS, as if SENSING something -- the Alien TURNS TO US: she is FEMALE, wearing large ADJUSTABLE GOGGLES. This is MAZ KANATA. MAZ Han Solo! Everyone turns to look. ,10400
It's ALL QUIET in here. ,142000
HAN (Sotto) Oh boy. (Louder, waving) Hey, Maz! NOISE returns. ,5770
Maz walks to them, pushes someone away. ,368000
MAZ Where's my boyfriend? ,1510000
HAN Chewie's working on the Falcon. ,128000
MAZ I like that Wookiee. ,3710000
I assume you need something. ,34600
Desperately. ,5340000
Let's get to it. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: Maz walks off, gesturing for them to follow. ,631000
Finn and Rey are confused. ,1080000
Han indicates for them to follow. ,285000
They do -- passing the enormous GRUMMGAR, who sits with vixen BAZINE NETAL, who watches them suspiciously. ,25
A SMALL DROID (GA-97), who turns its head to see BB-8 following Rey across the room. ,116000
GA-97, now animated, makes a small TRANSMITTING SOUND, which is subtitled. ,99500
GA-97 Alert the Resistance. ,231000
Their missing droid is here! And we CUT TO: IN A DARK ALCOVE - MOMENTS LATER Bazine enters a shadowy space, stealthily makes a call on a communicator. ,29
Clearly, BAZINE IS A SPY. Subtitled: BAZINE Inform the First Order... ,86
I've found the droid. ,1270000
EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY A massive Star Destroyer hovers over the hacked ice planet. ,5520
INT. STAR DESTROYER - KYLO REN'S CHAMBERS - DAY A dark space. ,131000
Kylo Ren, CLOSE TO CAMERA, addresses someone OFF-CAMERA whom we do not see. ,78200
KYLO REN Forgive me. ,3790000
I feel it again. ,1990000
The pull to the light. ,7360000
Supreme Leader senses it. ,69700
Show me again, the power of the darkness, and I will let nothing stand in our way. ,4570000
Show me, Grandfather, and I will finish what you started. ,553000
As his emotion builds, he stands and heads off -- we FOLLOW HIM, PIVOTING TO REVEAL who he was talking to: THE BURNT, ASHEN, GHOSTLY DEFORMED MASK OF DARTH VADER. CUT TO: INT. MAZ'S CASTLE - TABLE - DAY Maz is putting together some FOOD as she says: MAZ A map to Skywalker himself? ,3
You're right back in the mess. ,54200000
HAN Maz, I need you to get this droid to Leia. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: MAZ Hmm. ,5320
No. You've been running away from this fight for too long. ,983000
Han, nyakee nago wadda. ,33
Go home! HAN Leia doesn't want to see me. ,4820000
FINN Please, we came here for your help. ,1870000
REY What fight? ,14
MAZ The only fight: against the dark side. ,664000
Through the ages, I've seen evil take many forms. ,106000
The Sith. ,1910000
The Empire. ,11000000
Today, it is the First Order. ,707000
Their shadow is spreading across the galaxy. ,655000
We must face them. ,326000
Fight them. ,496000
All of us. ,29000000
FINN There is no fight against the First Order! Not one we can win. ,1760000
Look around. ,11000000
There's no chance we haven't been recognized already. ,1320000
I bet you the First Order is on their way right-- Finn stops, seeing Maz adjusting her goggles, scrutinizing him -- her eyes get HUGE. FINN (CONT'D) What's this? ,45
What are you doing? ,7860000
Maz adjusts the goggles again. ,15100
Her eyes get impossibly BIGGER. She grunts recognition. ,12800
She hoists herself on the tabletop, knocking over food and plates, crawling towards Finn. ,4580
FINN (CONT'D) Solo, what is she doing? ,209000
HAN I don't know, but it ain't good. ,80100000
MAZ If you live long enough you see the same eyes in different people. ,1510000
I'm looking at the eyes of a man who wants to run. ,750000
FINN (eyes on Maz) You don't know a thing about me. ,17400000
Where I'm from. ,11200000
What I've seen. (MORE) (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: FINN (CONT'D) You don't know the First Order like I do. ,69000
They'll slaughter us. ,214000
We all need to run. ,56100000
Rey is stunned. ,61600
Maz, not so much. ,45400
She crawls back to her chair. ,12000000
She points to some pirates in the corner. ,699000
MAZ You see those two? ,97300
They'll trade work for transportation to the Outer Rim. ,66500
There, you can disappear. ,2950000
Finn sees them. ,54
Considers. ,8540000
REY Finn! FINN Come with me. ,115000
REY What about BB-8? ,87400000
We're not done yet. ,284000
We have to get him back to your base. ,42300000
FINN I can't. ,96800000
Finn stands to leave. ,94700
He offers the gun back to Han. ,29400
HAN Keep it, kid. ,4620000
Finn heads off. ,668000
Rey gets up to follow. ,2030000
Maz dials her lenses back to normal, and turns to Han. ,86
MAZ Who's the girl? ,319000
ON FINN Who has arrived at the table with the ALIEN SMUGGLERS. FINN I was told you could get me to the Outer Rim. ,65000
Rey barges into the conversation, interrupting. ,16000
REY What are you doing? ,626000
Finn gets up to talk to her. ,35500
FINN (to Big Head) Don't leave without me. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: Embarrassed, Finn moves her away. ,60000
REY You can't just go. ,137000
I won't let you. ,73000000
FINN I'm not who you think I am. ,92700000
REY Finn, what are you talking about? ,71700000
FINN I'm not Resistance. ,4150000
I'm not a hero. ,12200000
I'm a Stormtrooper. (STOPS HER) Like all of them, I was taken from a family I'll never know. ,1390000
And raised to do one thing... (EMOTIONAL) But my first battle, I made a choice. ,193000
I wasn't going to kill for them. ,143000
So I ran. ,8700000
FINN (CONT'D) Right into you. ,252000
And you looked at me like no one ever had. ,70300000
I was ashamed of what I was. ,2860000
But I'm done with the First Order. ,77100000
I'm never going back. ,40100000
Rey, come with me. ,1060000
REY Don't go. ,1210000
FINN Take care of yourself. ,31200
Please. ,32500000
Rey looks at him, crushed. ,801000
With quiet resignation, Rey watches Finn return to the aliens... ,94000
And all three head off. ,17200000
He gets to the front door and walks through it. ,292000
Rey is heartsick, but she turns as she hears the sound of a young girl in anguish, crying. ,77800
She follows the sound into the castle, turning so she can't see that Finn has looked back at her one last time. ,37500
INT. MAZ' CASTLE - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY Rey steps down into the basement corridor. ,46700
BB-8 follows her. ,23
Walking carefully and confused, she is not sure why she's down here. ,1560000
She can hear the echoing sounds of a young girl crying. ,614000
She heads down the hall... to the very end, where there is a door. ,37600
It is almost as if a SOULFUL VIBRATION draws her closer. ,17800
She looks at the door lock -- AND THE DOOR OPENS. Hesitant, Rey enters. ,1380000
INT. MAZ'S CASTLE - CRYPT ROOM - DAY Rey moves into the dark, small, vaulted storage room. ,1220
Old treasures line the floors and walls, but there is something specific Rey is drawn to: on a table, an old wooden BOX. She moves to it, unsure, afraid, as if an energy from inside the box has been calling her here. ,36800
BB-8 nervously follows. ,88300000
Rey reaches out, very slowly, to touch the box. ,58700
A moment heavy with tension. ,695000
Rey OPENS THE BOX and sees inside Luke Skywalker's original lightsaber. ,11400
With hesitation, she reaches towards it, but she cannot resist. ,44600
As her hand makes contact with it, there is the piercing sound of a lightsaber igniting. ,147000
She moves her hand away, as REY HEARS A MECHANICAL BREATHING sound. ,9200
The CAMERA MOVES, LIGHTING CHANGES -- and we see behind her something impossible: a HALLWAY OF FROM DEEP INSIDE CLOUD CITY. Disembodied voices fill the air. ,21500
YOUNG GIRL NO! She stands -- looks around, confused by all she sees and hears. -- Turns and sees, through a DOORWAY. We follow Rey and she runs down the corridor, but it all TILTS -- TURNS -- and she lands on the WALL -- which is now the GROUND -- dried GRASS. She turns to look -- we PIVOT -- and see a BURNING TEMPLE AT NIGHT. We PAN to: R2-D2 -- who watches the flames -- and a MAN appears (LUKE, whose face we do not see). ,1400
He falls to his knees, reaches out to the droid -- with a MECHANICAL RIGHT HAND. We PUSH IN ON REY as RAIN BEGINS -- and DAY TURNS TO NIGHT -- and she LOOKS UP -- we TILT UP -- To see we're LOOKING UP AT A WARRIOR as he is STABBED BY A FIERY LIGHTSABER! He screams and falls to the ground -- we FOLLOW HIM, revealing Rey again, now in a nighttime battlefield. ,85
She gets to her feet, frightened by what she sees. ,12200000
We PIVOT AROUND HER to REVEAL KYLO REN, and the six other KNIGHTS OF REN, who flank him! Come back around to Rey, soaking now, as the RAIN STOPS and SUNLIGHT illuminates her -- she turns to look -- we PIVOT -- and see... ,47
A little girl. ,10400000
Rey as a child. ,7330000
She is sobbing, hysterical. ,3660000
Unkar Plutt's meaty hand holds her thin arm. ,1060
She is on Jakku, watching a starship fly into the sky, abandoning her. ,865000
YOUNG GIRL No, come back! (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: UNKAR PLUTT Quiet, girl! The ship flies towards the desert sun, which is strangely eclipsed, as if being eaten by darkness. ,1240
Rey looks around her to see she is.. ,5850000
In a NIGHTTIME, BARREN, SNOWY WOODS. She's losing her mind, confounded and lost and she gets to her feet, her breath seen in the frigid air -- and then: THE SOUND OF CLASHING LIGHTSABERS! She moves through the woods, toward the sound. ,1370
Rey runs, heart pounding, when KYLO REN EMERGES FROM BEHIND A TREE! She stops, SCREAMS, FALLS BACK and LANDS IN: INT. MAZ' CASTLE - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY She falls back, out of the room, suddenly sitting in the hall, out of breath, alarmed and perplexed. ,44
She HEARS something and turns to look. ,584000
Maz stands at the end of the corridor, realizing what has just happened. ,178000
REY What was that? ,7460000
I shouldn't have gone in there. ,1250000
MAZ That lightsaber was Luke's. ,22600
And his father's before him and now, it calls to you! Rey stands, fast. ,2280000
Still overwhelmed, emotional, speechless. ,27800
REY I have to get back to Jakku. ,193000
MAZ Han told me. (reaches out, hold REY'S HAND) Dear child. ,135000
I see your eyes. ,2710000
You already know the truth. ,70700000
Whomever you're waiting for on Jakku, they're never coming back. ,2690000
But... there's someone who still could. ,71200000
REY Luke. ,181000
MAZ The belonging you seek is not behind you. ,89900000
It is ahead. ,694000
I am no Jedi, but I know the Force. ,6090
It moves through and surrounds every living thing. ,82800
Close your eyes. ,5000000
Feel it. (MORE) (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: MAZ (CONT'D) The light. ,4960000
It's always been there. ,19900000
It will guide you. ,12700000
The saber. ,294000
Take it. ,14200000
Rey suddenly stands. ,1640000
REY I'm never touching that again. ,119000
I don't want any part of this. ,196000
And Rey runs off, passing Maz. ,90100
Rey's mind is spinning -- she can't take it -- she turns and heads off, fast. ,2920000
BB-8 follows her. ,23
TIGHT ON MAZ, watching her go. ,430000
Maz SIGHS, feeling for the young girl. ,222000
EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY Rey exits the castle, needs to run, but doesn't know where. ,47700
Heads toward the woods. ,2800000
EXT. FOREST - DAY Rey moves through the foliage, heart racing. ,77100
Over this, we HEAR a RUMBLING -- intense, an OMEN of something horrible to come. ,123000
EXT. STARKILLER BASE - ASSEMBLY AREA - DAY A massive rally: a thousand STORMTROOPERS, TIE FIGHTERS, OFFICERS and VEHICLES. BRUTALIST STRUCTURES, mountainous SNOWY LANDSCAPE. Addressing them at a podium, flanked by RED FIRST ORDER BANNERS, is HUX. His voice ECHOES: GENERAL HUX Today is the end of the Republic! The end of a regime that acquiesces to disorder! At this very moment, in a system far from here the New Republic LIES to the GALAXY while secretly supporting the treachery of the loathsome Resistance. ,4
This fierce machine which you have built, upon which we stand, will bring an end to the Senate! To their cherished fleet! All remaining systems will bow to the First Order! And will remember this... as the last day of the Republic! INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - DAY ENGINEERS perform FINAL FIRING PROTOCOL. There's a sense of nervousness -- WILL THIS MASSIVE WEAPON ACTUALLY WORK? EXT. STARKILLER BASE - ASSEMBLY AREA - DAY GENERAL HUX FIRE! And Hux TURNS to give the signal as we CUT BACK WIDE -- a ROAR OF BOOTS ON PAVEMENT as the thousand Stormtroopers TURN to face an endless snowy landscape. ,WHAT IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN?! EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY A view PAST THE RALLY. For a moment, nothing. ,1430000
Then, eerily SILENT, AN IMPOSSIBLE BLAST OF FIRE LIGHT -- LIKE AN ATOMIC BOMB TEST TIMES A ZILLION -- BLASTS FROM MILES AWAY, INTO THE SKY! Seconds later, a TERRIBLE EXPLOSIVE ROAR! The Troopers -- everyone -- is nearly PUSHED BACK by the FORCE of it -- the magnitude! Many have to COVER THEIR EYES! For MILES around the FIREBEAM, ICE AND SNOW MELTS INSTANTLY! Runoff tunnels FLOODED with AN OCEAN OF FRESH WATER. AIRBORNE CREATURES by the thousands burst from trees and take flight. ,667
Hux watches, his eyes WILD WITH POWER AND EVIL. From HIS eyes, CUT TO: INT. STAR DESTROYER BRIDGE - DAY TIGHT ON KYLO REN as he watches the Starkiller firing. ,49
EXT. MAZ' CASTLE - DAY Finn boards the Alien Freighter. ,8000
The SOUND FROM THE SKY makes him turn back. ,242000
He sees the PATH OF FIRE and his blood runs cold, his heart sinks. ,93500
EXT. REPUBLIC SYSTEM - NIGHT At a massive distance we see PLANETS THE REPUBLIC CAPITAL SYSTEM -- INCREASINGLY LIT, THEN POWERFULLY HIT BY THE VAST FIREBLAST WHICH OBLITERATES IT ALL! EXT. REPUBLIC CITY - NIGHT The galaxy CENTER OF GOVERNMENT at NIGHT. Impressive structures. ,1200
Senators and dignitaries look in uncomprehending horror to the night sky. ,10900
LIGHT GROWING -- FROM A GREAT DISTANCE a CIRCLE OF FIRE -- LIKE A SMALL SUN APPEARING FROM NOWHERE AND GROWING CLOSE AND MASSIVE, TURNING NIGHT TO DAY! And in seconds THE FIRE BLOCKS OUT EVERYTHING ELSE, AND THE ENTIRE PLANET OF HOSNIAN PRIME IS INCINERATED! EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY A crowd of ALIENS files out from inside, all eyes on the FIRE IN THE SKY. Dozens of LANGUAGES exclaiming fear and horror. ,31
Find Han and Chewie moving out, looking up. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: FINN (O.S.) It was the Republic. ,4290
Han and Chewie turn as Finn arrives, moving quickly through the crowd. ,20000
With dread: FINN (CONT'D) The First Order, they've done it. ,13200
Where's Rey? ,8460000
EXT. FOREST - DAY Rey races through the forest and finally comes to a stop, overwhelmed and exhausted. ,18900
At an emotional breaking point, she has no idea where to go, who to turn to. ,158000
Then she HEARS A BEEP -- turns to see BB-8, catching up with her. ,91
REY What are you doing? (HE BEEPS) You have to go back. (he BEEPS again) REY (CONT'D) BB-8. ,2320
No, you can't -- you have to go back, you're too important. ,22900000
They'll help you. ,5960000
Then, ANOTHER SOUND -- LOUDER NOW -- they LOOK UP AGAIN: in front of the system attack, A FLEET OF FIRST ORDER SHIPS ROAR OVERHEAD, TOWARD THE CASTLE! Rey's heart sinks: HER FRIENDS ARE IN DANGER! INT. MAZ'S CASTLE - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY Maz leads Han, Finn and Chewie down the hall, fast: MAZ I've had this for ages... ,16
MAZ'S CASTLE - TREASURE ROOM - DAY Maz opens the box -- holds out the lightsaber to Finn: MAZ Kept it locked away. ,17
HAN Where'd you get that? ,367000
MAZ A good question for another time. (TO FINN) Take it! Find your friend! Finn grabs it as the room is SHAKEN by an above ground attack. ,5380
MAZ (CONT'D) Those beasts! They're here! EXT. FOREST - DAY Rey and BB-8 race fast back toward the castle -- EXPLOSION SOUNDS can be HEARD from the direction they're headed! EXT. FOREST - DAY Rey races through the trees -- sees Maz' castle -- BEING DESTROYED BY FIRST ORDER SHIPS! Aliens RUNNING, GETTING OBLITERATED by SCREAMING TIE FIGHTERS! Other TIE FIGHTERS and TRANSPORTERS LAND, STORMTROOPERS in attack. ,6
Just then, filtered RADIO CALLS get Rey's attention: nearby STORMTROOPERS have spotted her, AND FIRE! STORMTROOPER FN-417, hold position! Rey takes cover, grabs her BLASTER -- but IT WON'T FIRE! She panics, then realizes: REY Safety! SHE SWITCHES OFF THE SAFETY and FIRES BACK! HITS TWO TROOPERS and retreats, calls to BB-8: BB-8 follows Rey AWAY FROM THE CASTLE, firing back at more chasing Troopers! EXT. MAZ' CASTLE RUINS - DAY Kylo Ren moves through the DEBRIS. A Stormtrooper approaches: STORMTROOPER #4 Sir, the droid was spotted heading west, with a girl. ,2
Kylo Ren LOOKS BACK SHARPLY, in Rey's direction -- EXT. FOREST - DAY Rey and BB-8 move swiftly, terrified -- she stops them: REY You have to keep going, stay out of sight, I'll try to fight 'em off. (BB-8 BEEPS; bravely through her fear) I hope so, too. ,3
BB-8 BEEPS and heads off -- Rey RUNS and TAKES COVER behind a massive, mossy tree. ,34600
TIGHT on her TERRIFIED FACE -- EXT. CASTLE DEBRIS - DAY Han, Chewie, Finn and Maz, exhausted, CLIMB UP, peek through debris. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: HAN Come on, Chewie! Maz turns to Finn: MAZ Rey and BB-8, they need you. ,24
Now go. ,5340000
FINN I need a weapon. ,3620000
Maz grabs his wrist -- holds up his hand -- THE SABER. MAZ You have one! He looks at her questioningly -- he's supposed to use the lightsaber?! He TURNS IT ON. HAN AND CHEWIE RUN, TAKE COVER from BLASTS, FIRING BACK at Stormtroopers, taking some out! HAN Hey, can I try that? ,12
Han borrows Chewbacca's bowcaster, fires on Stormtroopers and sends them flying. ,2850
HAN (CONT'D) (TO CHEWBACCA) I like this thing. ,3960
FINN SURPRISES A STORMTROOPER WITH THE LIGHTSABER, then another! Untrained, he's athletic, brave, impressive. ,1180
One Stormtrooper has a MACE -- STORMTROOPER Traitor! FINN and the TROOPER WITH THE MACE battle. ,93100
The Mace Trooper KNOCKS FINN DOWN! The Stormtrooper is about to end him, when THE STORMTROOPER IS SHOT AND FALLS! Wide-eyed Finn sees Han run over, having fired the blast! Han helps him up. ,768
HAN You okay, Big deal? ,58200000
FINN Thanks! But TEN STORMTROOPERS come over a RISE, BLASTERS AIMED. STORMTROOPER Don't move! TK-338, we have targets in custody! (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: No way out, they DROP THEIR WEAPONS: TIGHT on the LIGHTSABER as it HITS THE GROUND. A STORMTROOPER HAND picks it up. ,27
Han's MIND RACES as a SQUAD OF TROOPERS appears behind them. ,3170000
Finn, Han and Chewie are MARCHED by Stormtroopers back toward a transport, hands on their heads. ,6330
But then -- A FAMILIAR ROAR RIPPING ACROSS THE LAKE -- Han turns -- they all do: coming toward them across the water, X- WINGS AND RESISTANCE SPACECRAFT APPEAR, BEGIN FIRING AT THE FIRST ORDER SHIPS! PUSH IN ON HAN, HOPE SURGING -- CHEWIE TALKS. STORMTROOPER (CONT'D) We have incoming at two-eight-point- six! Move! Dispatch! Move! Scramble all squads! Repeat, scramble all squads! Anti-air cover en route to our position! HAN It's the Resistance. ,One X-WING in particular -- MARKED IN BLACK -- SWOOPS DOWN and takes out the parked TIE FIGHTERS and Troopers! INT. POE'S X-WING - DAY It's Poe Dameron at the stick of his X-wing. ,6
POE Go straight ahead and don't let these dogs scare you! JESS (V.O.) Copy that! SNAP (V.O.) We're with you, Poe! The Stormtroopers around Finn, Han and Chewie SCATTER, TOSSED in EXPLOSIONS! The LIGHTSABER LANDS AGAIN -- FINN PICKS IT UP. HAN Quick! Chewie picks up his Bowcaster, Han takes the blaster. ,4
Shoots a Trooper. ,9790000
FINN Woohoo! YEAH! That's one helluva pilot! INT. POE'S X-WING - DAY POE WOOHOO! EXT. FOREST - DAY In the darkened woods, Rey, terrified, keeps her blaster aimed. ,7
Her eyes dart around for her pursuer. ,138000
And then: THE UNIQUE SOUND OF KYLO REN'S RASPING LIGHTSABER COMING TO LIFE -- A SOUND she's HEARD BEFORE in the FORCEBACK. Rey's heart skips a beat: she's even more scared now. ,9
Kylo Ren appears from behind a tree -- Rey FIRES again and again -- Kylo Ren moves toward her, USING HIS LIGHTSABER TO DEFLECT EVERY BLAST. She FIRES ferociously, but Kylo Ren keeps coming! His hand rises -- Rey suddenly STOPS -- GASPS -- UNABLE TO MOVE. KYLO REN The girl I've heard so much about. ,He walks AROUND HER, slowly, she won't let herself cry. ,1190000
KYLO REN (CONT'D) The droid. ,36000
He comes around to see her face. ,72600000
After a scary beat he WHIPS HIS SABER UP TO HER EYES, ILLUMINATING HER FACE. KYLO REN (CONT'D) Where is it? ,2580
WIDE SHOT: THE EPIC BATTLE BETWEEN RESISTANCE AND FIRST ORDER TROOPS, REFLECTED IN THE STILL LAKE. STORMTROOPER Request air support! EXT. FOREST - DAY Kylo Ren TURNS OFF HIS SABER, reaches up... and REACHES TOWARDS REY'S FACE. She can't move, strains in agony. ,12
After a beat, surprised by what he finds, he removes his hand. ,7520000
She is relieved but still afraid. ,24600
KYLO REN The map. ,3590000
You've seen it. ,1860000
Rey is horrified. ,21900
He TOUCHES HER FACE again: the pain, tears stream. ,13300000
Kylo Ren, taking more from her mind... ,915000
She stares at him, TERRIFIED, straining in agony -- Kylo Ren, mid-interrogation, TURNS TOWARD THE SOUND OF THE EXPLOSIONS. Stormtroopers APPROACH through the woods. ,2680
STORMTROOPER #5 Sir, Resistance fighters! We need more troops. ,3280000
Kylo Ren TURNS BACK TO Rey, his hand still on her face. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: KYLO REN Pull the division out. ,25900
Forget the droid. ,647000
We have what we need. ,199000000
A GESTURE from Kylo Ren and REY LOSES CONSCIOUSNESS, FALLS FROM FRAME! EXT. CASTLE DEBRIS - DAY The BLACK-MARKED X-WING SWOOPS DOWN again, FIRING, EXPLODING another TIE Fighter! On the ground: STORMTROOPER Pull back the tree line! Han and Chewie dodge debris, FIRING and TAKING OUT TROOPERS. FINN takes out 2 TROOPERS with the blaster, then, out of breath, turns to see: Kylo Ren in the forest, CARRYING REY IN HIS ARMS, INTO HIS SHUTTLE! Finn's heart SHATTERS -- Han stops -- turns -- sees Kylo Ren entering his shuttle. ,3
Han is ROCKED. FINN NO!! REY!!! Heroically, Finn runs toward the shuttle through LASER BLASTS AND EXPLOSIONS, but the shuttle TAKES OFF -- Finn irrationally CHASES IT, SCREAMS DESPERATELY: FINN (CONT'D) No, no, no, no... ,23
REY!! In crazed frustration, Finn stops running, watches the receding First Order ships, Rey their captive. ,19700
EXT. FOREST - DAY BB-8 moves fast, then stops and looks up as the First Order ships RETREAT, OFF PLANET. A considered beat, and BB-8 heads BACK FOR THE CASTLE. EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE RUINS - DAY Post battle. ,22
Finn runs to Han: FINN He took her! Did you see that? ,80500
He took her. ,2250000
She's gone! HAN (WALKS PAST) Yeah, yeah, I know... ,1360000
And he and Chewie head off. ,118000
EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE RUINS - DAY Han moves toward a RESISTANCE TRANSPORT landing in the debris. ,17400
BB-8 rolls up beside him, in wait for the transport. ,655000
ON HAN'S FACE, knowing exactly what's about to happen. ,54200000
Finally, the transport door opens. ,887000
And standing there is LEIA. She sees Han and is stunned. ,12400
A silent beat, husband and wife reunited for the first time in years. ,1100000
In the smoke and embers, no one says a word. ,287000
Then C-3PO walks out from the transport, into the field: C-3PO Goodness! Han Solo! It is I, See- Threepio! (sees Han, stops) You probably don't recognize me because of the red arm. (sees Leia, INCREASINGLY AWKWARD) Look who it is! Did you see who? ,75
Oh. Excuse me, Prin-- uh, General. ,217000
Sorry. ,19200000
Come along, BB-8. ,125000
Quickly. (BB-8 BEEPS) Yes, I must get my proper arm reinstalled. ,54200
He hurries off. ,9770
Finally, alone again. ,6090000
HAN You changed your hair. ,1220000
LEIA Same jacket. ,307000
HAN No, new jacket. ,621000
Chewie glad to see Leia, greets her with a hug. ,240000
Chewie MOANS a few words, looks at Han then boards the ship. ,130000
It is complicated and loving and painful. ,251000
Han says, quietly: HAN (CONT'D) ... ,21800
I saw him. ,9850000
Leia, I saw our son. ,10500000
He was here. ,26000000
Leia hears this. ,7210000
Maz watches through the smoke. ,1870
EXT. SPACE - DAY The FALCON and surviving X-WINGS ROAR past camera toward a PLANET WITH GREEN FLORA AND A RING OF ASTEROIDS. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: This is D'QAR. EXT. D'QAR - DAY The SHIPS DESCENDING among grassy mounds and sunken structures. ,6
EXT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY LARGE GRASS MOUNDS cover HANGARS, beneath the odd, giant trees. ,8
BOOM DOWN as RESISTANCE GROUND CREW direct an X-WING to a LANDING. In the FOREGROUND, another X-wing canopy OPENS, a PILOT climbs out. ,64
PAN TO REVEAL the landed Millennium Falcon. ,955000
Finn runs down the ramp, UP TO CAMERA, desperate, searching. ,83500
Then BB-8 SPEEDS RIGHT PAST HIM, almost knocking him down -- Finn watches as BB-8 rolls over to the PILOT GETTING OUT OF THE BLACK-MARKED X-WING. The Pilot's helmet comes off. ,30200
IT IS POE! Finn can't believe what he's seeing. ,222000
And Poe, kneeling in WARM REUNION with BB-8, listens and reacts to something the droid tells him. ,21700
Poe looks up and sees Finn -- and he can't believe it either! Poe smiles, points at Finn. ,17500
From a distance, Finn gestures in sheer amazement that Poe is alive. ,25800
FINN Poe. ,63300
Poe Dameron. ,391000
They move to each other -- and embrace. ,384000
FINN (CONT'D) You're alive! POE So are you! FINN What happened to you? ,124000
POE What happened? ,7570000
I got thrown from the crash, woke up at night -- no you, no ship, nothing-- BB-8 BEEPS -- Poe listens, turns to Finn. ,55000
POE (CONT'D) BB-8 says that you saved him. ,149000
FINN No, no, no. ,16800000
It wasn't just me. ,4280000
POE You completed my mission, Finn. ,1060000
That's my jacket? (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: FINN Oh here. ,503000
POE No, no, no. ,6840000
Keep it. ,17300000
It suits you. ,8140000
You're a good man, Finn. ,33100
FINN Poe -- I need your help. ,258000
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY MOVE FAST with Finn and Poe. ,305000
Finn takes in this makeshift command center, buried deep among vines and roots. ,22500
They arrive at Leia, who stands with a group of Resistance Officers, including ADMIRALS ACKBAR and STATURA: POE General Organa. ,197000
Sorry to interrupt, this is Finn, he needs to talk to YOU -- LEIA (takes Finn's hand) And I need to talk to him. ,179000
That was incredibly brave, what you did. ,5420000
Renouncing the First Order, saving this man's life -- FINN (surprised she knows) Thank you, ma'am -- but a friend of mine was taken prisoner-- LEIA Han told me about the girl, I'm sorry. ,1360
Finn is startled -- Poe jumps in: POE Finn's familiar with the weapon that destroyed the Hosnian system. ,5930
He worked on the base. ,410000
LEIA We're desperate for anything you can tell us. ,54500
FINN That's where my friend was taken -- I've got to get there, fast. ,13500000
LEIA And I will do everything I can to help, but first you must tell us all you know. ,2990000
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY Chewbacca sits on a bed in the med bay. ,38200
DR. KALONIA uses a device to help heal his shoulder. ,242000
Chewie TALKS. DR. KALONIA (CHEWIE TALKS) That sounds very scary. (CHEWIE TALKS) You must be so brave. ,7380
Chewie agrees. ,61
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY C-3PO takes the DATA DEVICE from BB-8 and inserts it into a BASE COMPUTER. THE PROJECTED MAP APPEARS in HOLOGRAM. Leia enters, studying it, dispirited. ,60
PAN as she moves, REVEALING HAN. C-3PO is here and some others. ,262000
C-3PO General, I regret to inform you, but this map recovered from BB-8 is only partially complete. ,1460
And even worse, it matches no charted system on record. ,136000
We simply do not have enough information to locate Master Luke. ,389000
LEIA I can't believe I was so foolish to think that I could just find Luke and bring him home. ,315000
HAN Leia... ,49000
LEIA Don't do that. ,98700000
HAN Do what? ,32600000
She heads off. ,425000
LEIA Anything. ,851
Flummoxed, Han follows looking at C-3PO. C-3PO Princesses. ,12300
Han follows Leia across the base floor: HAN I'm trying to be helpful! (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: LEIA When did that ever help? ,61700
And don't say the Death Star. ,80400000
HAN (SIGHS) INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY LOW WITH BB-8 as he rolls over and finds, under a dark and dusty tarp in a corner, R2-D2. BB-8 BEEPS at R2, pulls off the tarp and tries to start a conversation. ,5
But R2 DOESN'T RESPOND AT ALL. BB-8 tries again. ,101000
Nothing. ,17700000
BB-8 NUDGES R2. Nothing. ,4670000
Then: C-3PO (O.S.) BB-8. ,166000
You're wasting your time. ,2210000
BB-8 looks up at C-3PO, who stands there. ,150000
C-3PO SIGHS. C-3PO (CONT'D) It is very doubtful that R2 would have the rest of the map in his backup data. (BB-8 BEEPS) I am afraid not. ,14
R2-D2 has been in low power mode ever since Master Luke went away. ,42300
Sadly, he may never be his old self again. ,34600000
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY Leia hears the change in Han's voice and softens. ,68400
She turns. ,778000
HAN Listen to me, will you? ,1680000
I know every time you... every time you look at me, you're reminded of him. ,6460000
LEIA You think I want to forget him? ,11300000
I want him back! Han looks at her with sympathy. ,717000
HAN There was nothing we could've done. (hard for him to say) There was too much Vader in him. ,3020000
LEIA That's why I wanted him to train with Luke. ,3350000
I just never should have sent him away. ,7450000
That's when I lost him. ,27
That's when I lost you both. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: HAN We both had to deal with it in our own way. ,44100
I went back to the only thing I was ever good at. ,3400000
LEIA We both did. ,19400000
HAN We lost our son, forever. ,51900000
LEIA No. (LONG BEAT) It was Snoke. ,51600
Han takes this in. ,6450000
LEIA (CONT'D) He seduced our son to the dark side. ,11300
But we can still save him. ,5450000
Me. You. ,14400000
HAN If Luke couldn't reach him, how could I? ,2450000
LEIA Luke is a Jedi... you're his father. ,584000
There's still light in him. ,884000
I know it. ,9910000
GENERAL STATURA General, the reconnaissance report on the enemy base is coming. ,32800
INT. STARKILLER BASE - HOLDING CELL - DAY Rey wakes, disoriented. ,72
She is in an angled, upright restraining rig. ,83300
Looks over, startled to see Kylo Ren, mask in place, standing there. ,131000
REY Where am I? ,4520000
KYLO REN (LONG BEAT) You're my guest. ,3420000
REY Where are the others? ,16000000
KYLO REN You mean the murderers, traitors and thieves you call friends? (Rey stares at him) You'll be relieved to hear that I have no idea. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: Rey studies him. ,80
She's fearful... but curious. ,2610000
KYLO REN (CONT'D) You still want to kill me. ,25200
REY That happens when you're being hunted by a creature in a mask. ,104000
Kylo Ren stops, considers her... then reaches up, unlatches and REMOVES HIS MASK. Rey reacts, stunned. ,463
It takes a moment before she regains her own mask of defiance. ,340000
KYLO REN Tell me about the droid. ,1300000
REY (a nervous beat) He's a BB unit with a selenium drive and a thermal hyperscan vindicator -- KYLO REN He's carrying a section of a navigational chart. ,33
We have the rest, recovered from archives of the Empire. ,424000
We need the last piece. ,30100
And somehow, you convinced the droid to show it to you. ,13000
You. ,57400000
A scavenger -- Rey reacts -- afraid -- how does he know? ,3070000
KYLO REN (CONT'D) You know I can take whatever I want. ,13800000
Trepidation flashes across Rey's eyes. ,489000
Kylo Ren moves closer, his hand rising toward her. ,1200000
She recoils, but has nowhere to go. ,5570000
Kylo Ren nearly TOUCHES HER FACE... ,2400000
THEY'RE BOTH SURPRISED: they react to a feeling that passes between them -- AN ENERGY THEY RECOGNIZE IN EACH OTHER. And then it's gone. ,57300
Adversaries again. ,3060
Rey can't move, quietly strains in agony, trying to resist Ren's probing. ,15000
KYLO REN (CONT'D) ... ,29500
You're so lonely... so afraid to leave... (then, slight smile) At night, desperate to sleep... you imagine an ocean. ,85400
I see it -- I see the island... ,49700000
Tears stream down her face as she resists. ,4210000
She tries to break free, but can't budge. ,131000
KYLO REN (CONT'D) And Han Solo. ,5870
You feel like he's the father you never had. ,4640000
He would've disappointed you. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: His hand still on her face, her eyes fierce through the agony: REY -- Get out of my head -- But this just makes Kylo lean closer. ,23000
KYLO REN I know you've seen the map. ,473000
It's in there... and now you'll give it to me. ,89000000
Don't be afraid. ,2860000
I feel it too. ,5130000
Where her strength comes from, she doesn't know, but: REY I'm not giving you anything. ,126000
KYLO REN We'll see. ,59500
He peers into her eyes intensely. ,86800
She meets his gaze -- DESPITE THE PAIN SHE IS STRONG. On Ren's face as HIS CONFIDENCE BEGINS TO MELT AWAY. He has slammed up against a barrier in her mind. ,652
He looks less certain by the moment as Rey seems to GROW IN STRENGTH. The FEROCITY of confrontation builds until it hits critical mass AND REY DOES THE UNTHINKABLE! SHE ENTERS HIS HEAD, AMAZED AT WHAT SHE IS SEEING! REY ... ,1360
You... you're afraid... that you will never be as strong as... ,34200000
Darth Vader! KYLO REN SUDDENLY WITHDRAWS HIS HAND, as if her face were FIRE HOT. TAKES A STEP BACK, CONFUSED, RATTLED. Rey's body is released, she breathes deeply, her powerful eyes still on Kylo Ren, who starts to leave. ,76
And we PRELAP: SNOKE (V.O.) This scavenger, resisted you? ,2960
INT. STARKILLER PLANET - ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT Kylo Ren, mask off, stands before Snoke. ,3330
KYLO REN She's strong with the Force, untrained but, stronger than she knows. ,42800
And while Ren's mind no doubt goes to Luke: SNOKE And the droid? (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: Kylo Ren hesitates to reveal the truth. ,1250
Then: GENERAL HUX (O.S.) Ren believed it was no longer valuable to us. ,7880
Ren turns back -- Hux enters the large space, moves to the platform beside Ren. ,32300
GENERAL HUX (CONT'D) That the girl was all we needed. ,146000
As a result, the droid has most likely been returned to the hands of the enemy. ,38700
They may have the map already. ,5560000
Snoke is visibly furious. ,73900
SNOKE Then the Resistance must be destroyed before they get to Skywalker. ,37400
GENERAL HUX We have their location. ,6150000
We tracked their reconnaissance ship to the Ileenium system. ,14100
SNOKE Good. ,112000
Then we will crush them once and for all. ,13700000
Prepare the weapon. ,1870000
Kylo Ren is stunned by the moment -- that isn't what he meant at all -- KYLO REN Supreme Leader. ,7680
I can get the map from the girl. ,35300000
I just need your guidance. ,109000
SNOKE If what you say about this girl is true, bring her to me. ,2020000
INT. STARKILLER BASE - HOLDING CELL - DAY SLOW PUSH IN ON REY, shackled, mind still racing over what's happened between her and Kylo Ren. ,76
She is flooded with emotions, feeling her potential, her strength, that in this moment of being restrained, perhaps anything is possible. ,10300
She turns to the Stormtrooper Guard. ,45300
Studies him for an intense beat. ,1620000
Then says: REY You will remove these restraints. ,496000
And leave this cell, with the door open. ,67600
The Stormtrooper Guard looks at her. ,36700
A beat. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: TROOPER GUARD #2 What did you say? ,2680000
Rey's eyes stay trained on him. ,2210000
She shifts in her seat, her confidence wavering, but she repeats, with authority: REY You will remove these restraints. ,34800
And leave this cell, with the door open. ,71600
The Stormtrooper Guard, rifle aimed, MOVES FOR HER. Rey's heart pounds -- is she about to be killed, freed, or laughed at? ,6740
The tension unbearable when the Guard says: TROOPER GUARD #2 I'll tighten those restraints, scavenger scum! INT. STARKILLER BASE - CORRIDOR 1 - DAY LOW ANGLE: Kylo Ren, masked, rounds a corner, PASSES US. INT. STARKILLER BASE - HOLDING CELL - DAY Rey stares intently at the trooper. ,72400
Calms herself. ,17900
And tries again. ,58000
REY You will remove these restraints. ,556000
And leave this cell, with the door open. ,70600
TROOPER GUARD #2 I will remove these restraints. ,1440000
And leave this cell, with the door open. ,69900
He reaches down and UNLATCHES THE RESTRAINTS. HE THEN TURNS AND STARTS TO HEAD OUT, her back to him as he exits. ,4390
SHE IS IN SHOCK. Then tries, quickly: REY And you will drop your weapon. ,2570000
TROOPER GUARD #2 And I'll drop my weapon. ,1450000
The Trooper Guard DROPS HIS WEAPON without turning back -- Rey HEARS the gun fall. ,142000
She's incredulous. ,746000
The guard has LEFT THE CELL, ITS DOOR OPEN. REY, in ABSOLUTE DISBELIEF, MOVES QUICKLY OUT OF FRAME! INT. STARKILLER BASE - HOLDING CELL - DAY Kylo Ren enters the cell -- we PUSH IN ON HIM as he takes in the empty cell -- AND IMMEDIATELY UNDERSTANDS WHAT HAS HAPPENED. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: KYLO REN NO! Enraged, he RIPS OUT HIS SABER and -- EXT. STARKILLER BASE - CORRIDOR 1 - DAY WIDE ANGLE, empty corridor, toward the cell: we only HEAR the horrible SOUNDS. DESTRUCTION. YELLING. A few pieces of red hot DEBRIS BOUNCES into the corridor. ,24
Two STORMTROOPERS, crossing at the far end of the hall, STOP TO WATCH this display of pure FURY. They retreat, and fast. ,59
INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - DAY Workers at their controls. ,707000
Vast snowy landscape seen outside. ,125000
Their GAUGES RISE -- THE WEAPON CHARGING SLOWLY -- GENERAL HUX Begin charging the weapon! STARKILLER TECHNICIAN Yes, sir. ,20800
Weapon charging. ,94600
EXT. STARKILLER BASE PLANET - DAY A vast view of the planet -- a MASSIVE SOLARVAC ARRAY surrounds a port TEN MILES IN DIAMETER. MILLIONS OF PANELS turn on the ARRAY -- a wave of BRILLIANT REFLECTIONS. Suddenly, like a planetary-scale TESLA COIL LINE OF ENERGY, THE POWER OF THE SUN begins to TRAVEL DOWN to the Starkiller Base planet. ,3
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY Finn, now a member of the inner circle of the Resistance, is huddled with the group around the MAP TABLE, which displays a WIREFRAME HOLOGRAM of a ROLLING VIEW OF THE SURFACE OF STARKILLER BASE. With Finn are Han, Leia, Poe, C-3PO, Statura, Ackbar, Brance, SNAP, MAJOR EMATT (60), NIEN NUNB, and others. ,3
An urgent, messy strategy session -- POE The scan data from Snap's reconnaissance flight confirms Finn's report. ,40000
SNAP They've somehow created a hyper lightspeed weapon built within the planet itself. ,11800
BRANCE A laser cannon? (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: SNAP We're not sure how to describe a weapon of this scale. ,152000
MAJOR EMATT (HORRIBLE MEMORIES) It's another Death Star. ,73700
POE I wish that were the case, Major. ,340000
Poe hits a control. ,6710000
A WIREFRAME OF THE DEATH STAR APPEARS. POE (CONT'D) This was the Death Star. ,5240000
Poe hits another control -- the Death Star SHRINKS -- AND SHRINKS AND SHRINKS, as the SURFACE AREA OF THE STARKILLER BASE IS DRAWN INTO A LARGER IMAGE, REVEALING THE ENTIRE BASE PLANET. The Death Star is a minuscule SATELLITE in comparison. ,20
POE (CONT'D) This is Starkiller Base. ,82600
This is news to many here, and they're stunned. ,43500000
HAN So it's big. ,91100000
ADMIRAL ACKBAR How is it possible to power a weapon of this size? ,97900
FINN It uses the power of the sun. ,716000
As the weapon is charged, the sun is drained until it disappears. ,18200
An OFFICER runs up, hands Leia a DATACARD. LEIA (eyes on datacard) The First Order: they're charging the weapon again, now. (then, heart sinking) Our system is the next target. ,9910
C-3PO Oh my. ,84600000
Without the Republic fleet, we're doomed. ,953000
They all react to this horrible news. ,914000
HAN Okay, how do we blow it up? (all eyes on him) There's always a way to do that. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: But no one has anything. ,809000
Leia watches the silence, frustrated. ,938000
Finally, rallying them: LEIA Han's right. ,6710000
Han is surprised. ,14800000
ADMIRAL STATURA (at first hesitant) In order for that amount of power to be contained, that base would need some kind of thermal oscillator... ,7500
FINN There is one. ,333000000
All eyes on Finn as he moves around the hologram to a location on the Starkiller Base -- it is ZOOMED IN: A GIANT BLACK HEXAGONAL STRUCTURE. FINN (CONT'D) Precinct 47. ,4
Here. ,40500000
ADMIRAL STATURA (HYPOTHESIZING) If we can destroy that oscillator, it might de-stabilize the core and cripple the weapon. ,37
MAJOR EMATT ... ,4910
Maybe the planet. ,11600000
Poe then tries to bolster spirits, looking at the BIG HEXAGONAL STRUCTURE: the Oscillator. ,114000
POE We'll go in there and we'll hit that oscillator with everything we got. ,145000
ADMIRAL ACKBAR They have defensive shields that our ships cannot penetrate. ,1920
HAN We disable the shields. (TO FINN) Kid, you worked there, what do you got? ,285000
FINN (beat, then:) I can do it. ,1190000
HAN I like this guy. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: FINN I can disable the shields. ,222000
But I have to be there, on the planet-- HAN We'll get you there. ,259000000
LEIA Han, how? ,1080000
HAN If I told you, you wouldn't like it. ,1730000
POE So we disable the shields, take out the oscillator and we blow up their big gun. ,10200
All right. ,16300000
Let's go! And everyone splits. ,2200000
EXT. HANGARS, RESISTANCE BASE - DAY SERIES OF SHOTS: THE RESISTANCE FLEET PREPARES FOR ITS MISSION. Pilots inspect crafts, including Snap, Nien Nunb, and Poe at his black-marked X-wing. ,35
Mechanics make adjustments as Crews fuel the jets. ,220000
Ground controllers move ships into takeoff formation. ,35400
Pilots prep their ships, including BB-8, who is PULLED INTO Poe's black X-wing. ,16100
Finn approaches Poe wearing the jacket. ,183000
Poe slaps Finn's shoulder as he heads off. ,731000
Finn watches Poe, despite it all, a little laugh. ,10500
Over this: EXT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY Chewie and Finn follow Han's orders as they prepare the Falcon for one more daring run, maybe its last: HAN Chewie, check that donal capitator. ,6
Come on. ,14700000
Let's go. -- Finn, be careful with those - they're explosives. ,505000
FINN Now you tell me? ,3970000
LEIA No matter how much we fought, I've always hated watching you leave. ,128000
Han looks over, there's Leia. ,3220000
HAN That's what I did it. ,870000
So you'd miss me. ,42400000
She laughs, moves up close to him. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: LEIA I did miss you. ,1490000
He looks at her, says sweetly, out of the blue: HAN It wasn't all bad, was it? ,55100
Huh? ,11100000
Some of it was...good. ,4
LEIA ... ,14500000
Pretty good. ,8400000
HAN Some things never change. ,3380000
LEIA (SMILES) True. ,108000
You still drive me crazy. ,4610000
Han places his hands on her shoulders. ,93400
It could be thirty years ago. ,46300
They both know there's a good chance he won't make it back. ,639000
They pull each other tight, holding for dear life. ,308000
Quietly, LONGINGLY: LEIA (CONT'D) If you see our son again, bring him home. ,3430
INT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY STORMTROOPER Sir, sensors triggered in hangar 718. ,1330
We're searching the area. ,4500000
KYLO REN She's just beginning to test her powers. ,1590000
The longer it takes to find her, the more dangerous she becomes. ,528000
Kylo exits. ,900
INT. STARKILLER BASE - ATRIUM AREA - DAY TIGHT ON REY'S FACE as she peers nervously around a corner. ,12100
Rey runs down a long, glossy hall, taking cover in an alcove, the Trooper Guard's rifle HELD TIGHT. EXT. LIGHTSPEED SPACE - DAY The Falcon SCREAMS PAST -- INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY Flying at LIGHTSPEED, Finn, with Han and Chewie. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: FINN How are we getting in? ,10
HAN Their shields have a fractional refresh rate. ,16100
Keeps anything traveling slower than lightspeed from getting through. ,44300
Finn is suddenly filled with dread. ,135000
FINN We're gonna make our landing approach at lightspeed?! Chewie, thinking it's crazy too, says: HELL YES WE ARE! HAN Alright, Chewie, get ready. ,1890
Chewie GROANS: he's ready. ,1760000
Han studies the PANEL INDICATORS. HAN (CONT'D) And Now! Chewie and Han hit switches -- EXT. LIGHTSPEED SPACE/STARKILLER BASE - DAY The Falcon's ENVIRONMENT SHIFTS INSTANTLY FROM LIGHTSPEED TO PLANET ATMOSPHERE -- it's suddenly FLYING 100 FEET ABOVE THE SNOWY, ROCKY GROUND, HEADED FOR A THICK FOREST! INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY CHEWIE GROANS: HAN I AM PULLING UP!!! EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY But the Falcon has no time -- it PLOWS through the trees! It then RISES -- INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY ALARMS BLARE as the ship SLAMS THROUGH BRANCHES, SHOOTS TOWARD SKY! Han does his best to steer -- Chewie GROANS -- in the madness Han YELLS: HAN I get any higher, they'll see us! And the ship DIVES again, back into the trees! EXT. STARKILLER BASE - CLEARING - DAY A quiet CLEARING on the forest TREELINE. Suddenly the MILLENNIUM FALCON HURTLES OUT OF THE FOREST! From an eruption of BRANCHES and PINE, the ship DIVES -- SLAMS INTO THE SNOW! It DIGS THROUGH A THOUSAND YARDS OF WHITE until it finally comes to a canted stop, half buried in the snow! INT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY OFFICER Sir, she was not found in hangar 718 but all troops are on alert. ,KYLO REN Put every hangar on lock-down. ,57000
She's going to try to steal a ship to-- Suddenly, Kylo senses something. ,19300
Something familiar. ,209000
KYLO REN (CONT'D) Han Solo... ,59200
EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY MASSIVE WIDE SHOT of an EPIC SNOWSCAPE. Han, Finn and Chewie cross the terrain. ,1320
WALKERS appears on the horizon. ,3190000
Han, Finn and Chewie take cover behind a base structure. ,48700
Chewie carries a BLACK DUFFEL of EXPLOSIVES. FINN The flooding tunnels are over that ridge. ,3870
We'll get in that way. ,79400000
HAN What was your job when you were based here? ,3710000
FINN Sanitation. ,1520
HAN Sanitation? ,26100
Then how do you know how to disable the shields? ,3190000
FINN I don't. ,99800000
I'm just here to get Rey. ,1300000
HAN People are counting on us! The galaxy is counting on us--! FINN Solo, we'll figure it out! We'll use the Force! HAN That's not how the Force works--! (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: Chewie MOANTALKS. HAN (CONT'D) Oh really, you're cold? ,23
FINN Come on! They follow Finn on the snowy hike. ,2780000
On the horizon, THE LASER SIPHON SHOOTING INTO THE SKY, SLOWLY SUCKING THE SUN DRY. INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - DAY Technicians at work, the SUN SUCKING seen in the window behind him. ,8200

FIRST ORDER OFFICER Weapon charged in fifteen minutes, sir. ,21700
INT. STARKILLER BASE - CORRIDOR 4 - DAY A STORMTROOPER waits to board a Transport Compartment. ,502000
The door WHOOSHES open -- HAN, FINN and CHEWIE are there! STORMTROOPER FN-9330 Hey! He fumbles for his blaster but Chewie shoots first. ,10
WIDE ANGLE of the corridor as the Trooper flies back, dead. ,52100
Chewie drags him out of sight. ,37000
Han and Finn peer around a corner, wary. ,82900
HAN The longer we're here, less luck we're going to have. ,1140000
The shields? ,3270000
FINN I have an idea about that. ,3
Han and Chewie follow Finn. ,4030000
INT. STARKILLER BASE - CORRIDOR - DAY Captain Phasma heads down a corridor, distant Stormtroopers. ,39
Suddenly Phasma is T-BONED HARD AND FAST -- SHOVED OUT OF FRAME BY CHEWIE! And now we're in a NARROW CROSS-CORRIDOR, CHEWIE WITH HIS ARMS AROUND PHASMA, FORCED TO FACE FINN, WHO HOLDS HIS BLASTER ON HIS FORMER CAPTAIN. Han stands behind Finn. ,4
FINN Remember me? (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: CAPTAIN PHASMA FN-2187. ,610000
FINN Not anymore. ,8820000
The name's Finn, and I'm in charge. ,254000
I'm in charge now, Phasma. ,58100000
I'm in charge. ,64700000
HAN Bring it down. ,26500000
Bring it down. ,13100000
FINN Follow me. ,33800000
Finn SMILES as we CUT TO: INT. STARKILLER BASE - ATRIUM AREA - DAY TIGHT ON REY'S FACE as she peers nervously around a corner. ,1240
Rey runs down a long, glossy hall, taking cover in an alcove, the Trooper Guard's rifle HELD TIGHT. From this alcove, she can see down another LONG, PERPENDICULAR WALKWAY -- on one side, a STONE AND STEEL WALL. On the other side, a VAST ATRIUM, with a railing-free DROP OFF, the white pill-light design descending HUNDREDS OF FEET. At the end of this walkway is an OPEN HANGAR DOOR, revealing HUNDREDS OF TIE FIGHTERS parked outside. ,76
TIGHT on Rey's face as her plan is clear. ,2110000
But the problem: between her and the ship she wants to steal, is a GROUP OF STORMTROOPERS. Guards, in conversation. ,10400
As she tries to think about what to do next, we see, FAR BEHIND HER in the perpendicular hall, ANOTHER GROUP OF STORM- and SNOWTROOPERS headed her way! Rey's mind races -- another peek out and she RUNS FAST, across the walkway, and CLIMBS DOWN -- her fingertips disappearing over the edge just as the Troopers approach and continue. ,3
WIDE SHOT as Rey holds on carefully as the guards walk off, not seeing her over the edge, a death drop below her. ,689000
But then she SEES SOMETHING and has a brainstorm. ,3330000
She strenuously cross-climbs to an invisible SERVICE HATCH, which She opens, and climbs INSIDE THE WALL, closing the hatch behind her. ,8740
INT. STARKILLER BASE - INSIDE THE WALLS - DAY A REMARKABLE IMAGE, inside the inner workings of the base. ,4430
Tiny by comparison, Rey climbs amid the incredible infrastructure, a drop to infinity beneath her. ,177000
She is between the LIGHT SOURCE and the WHITE PILL SHAPES, as she makes her way ACROSS. INT. STARKILLER BASE - ATRIUM AREA - DAY WIDE SHOT of the Stormtrooper GUARDS, above the drop off into the atrium. ,2420
What they cannot see is a SHADOWED SILHOUETTE OF REY against the ENDLESS WHITE PILL LIGHTS as she climbs across the space, beneath them, toward her exit! INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ACCESS POINT - DAY CLOSE AS PHASMA SITS INTO FRAME in front of a WORKSTATION -- Finn, Han and Chewie, blasters aimed. ,3
Phasma reluctantly works controls on the workstation. ,11900
FINN You want me to blast that bucket off your head? ,18600000
Lower the shields. ,2070000
CAPTAIN PHASMA You're making a big mistake. ,2250000
FINN Do it. ,8660000
Chewie MOAN/TALKS. Phasma hits a few more buttons -- the controls BEEP-CLICK. "SHIELDS DISABLE INITIATE". Eyes on THE WORKSTATION: FINN (CONT'D) Solo, if this works, we're not going to have a lot of time to find Rey. ,7
HAN Don't worry kid, we won't leave here without her. ,2840000
The controls BEEP-CLICK. "SHIELDS DISABLED". CAPTAIN PHASMA (to Finn, cruel) You can't be so stupid as to think this will be easy. ,1820
My troops will storm this block and kill you all. ,1840000
FINN I disagree. ,6850000
What do we do with her? ,72700000
HAN Is there a garbage chute? ,22800
Trash compactor? ,780000
FINN Yeah, there is... ,13
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY An ALERT: OFFICERS at their consoles, OVERLAPPING, urgent. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: OFFICER General, their shields are down! C-3PO Thank the Maker! LEIA Han did it! Send them in! ADMIRAL STATURA Give Poe full authorization to attack. ,4

INT. X-WING - DAY A BEEPING from BB-8, riding in the back of his X-wing, and Poe looks out -- can't believe what he's seeing: DOZENS OF TIE FIGHTERS! POE Guys, we got a lot of company! INT. STARKILLER BASE - JUNCTION AREA - DAY Finn, Han and Chewie take cover, Chewie pulling some EXPLOSIVES out of the duffel. ,8
Blast doors nearby. ,1810000
FINN We'll use the charges to blow that blast door. ,661000
I'll go in and draw fire, but I'm gonna need cover. ,14300000
HAN You sure you're up for this? ,2020000
FINN Hell no -- I'll go in find and try to find Rey -- (improvising, fast) -- The troopers'll be on our tail. ,14900
We have to be ready for that. ,4180000
There's an access tunnel that'll leads -- (Han starts pointing with his chin to SOMETHING BEHIND FINN) Why are you doing that? ,48400
Why are you doing -- this? ,766000
I'm trying to come up with a plan. ,26900000
Finn turns -- AND SEES REY, CLIMBING OUT FROM INSIDE THE WALL, carefully climbing back up to the main level! He can't believe it! Chewie MURMURS his relief. ,1820
Han is maybe more grateful than anyone. ,160000
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY A Resistance Technician turns to Leia: ADMIRAL ACKBAR The Oscillator's still standing. ,111000
OFFICER X-wings coming back for another round of attacks! INT. STARKILLER BASE - CORRIDOR 6 - DAY Rey climbs up to the corridor, vigilant. ,9290
She hears a SOUND, SWOOPS her rifle at -- Finn, Han and Chewie! She cannot believe it! All Finn wants to do is hug her -- and she him. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: HAN Are you all right? ,2200
REY Yeah. ,315000
HAN Good. ,5930
FINN What happened -- did he hurt you? ,2130000
REY Finn. ,218000
What are you doing here?! FINN We came back for you. ,78300000
She is speechless -- this is all she's ever wanted anyone to do. ,635000
Chewie TALKS -- and Rey's eyes nearly tear up. ,13000000
FINN (CONT'D) What'd he say? ,79800000
REY (shrugs, smiles, though nearly in tears) ... ,148000
That it was your idea. ,4700
Finn awkwardly smiles. ,10500000
It's his nature. ,107000000
They embrace. ,266000
REY (CONT'D) Thank you. ,171000
FINN How did you get away? ,256000
REY I can't explain it. ,149000
And you wouldn't believe it. ,2090000
HAN Escape now. ,29000
Hug later. ,7790
EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY The X-Wings DOGFIGHT with the TIE Fighters on the surface of the snowy planet. ,32100
INTERCUT BETWEEN the ships SCREAMING past each other, and the COCKPITS of the Resistance and First Order fighters. ,3840
Poe's fighter NEARLY COLLIDES with a close- passing TIE Fighter! SNAP I got one behind me. ,9090

JESS Furillo's been hit! SNAP Watch out for ground fire! EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY The X-wings ROAR across the sky, BLASTING and DODGING the TIE Fighters and missiles. ,1350
PULL BACK TO REVEAL Han, Finn, Rey and Chewie, who run out here, into the snow, stopping, eyes on the sky, watching the lop-sided battle. ,9040
THE FOUR HEROES TURN TO EACH OTHER, RESOLVE IN THEIR EYES. A long moment of communication. ,683000
HAN They're in trouble. ,3
We can't leave. (to Finn, re: Chewie) My friend here has a bag full of explosives. ,2980
Let's use 'em. ,65800000
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY A Resistance Technician turns to Leia: KAYDEL KO CONNIX General, are you seeing this? ,1490
VOBER DAND Two more X-wings down. ,34200
That's half our fleet destroyed. ,3730000
C-3PO And their weapon will be fully charged in 10 minutes! It would take a miracle to save us now. ,3450
INT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS Han and Chewie arrive here to find THREE SECURITY STORMTROOPERS approaching a Maintenance Hatch. ,4
Instantly, Chewie takes out the middle one with his Bowcaster. ,1470000
Han and the other two Stormtroopers OPEN FIRE, but Han's aim is true. ,195000
ALARMS START BLARING! INT. JUNCTION STATION - NEAR DARKNESS Running inside from a parked snowspeeder, Rey opens a service hatch. ,5
Finn behind her, as she reaches into the mechanics of the place, very much like the very first shot we saw of Rey. ,23500
And she YANKS a piece of TECH from the machinery and: INT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS The HATCH OPENS! Han and Chewie, having been on the lookout, step inside, weapons poised. ,20
Chewie MOANS. HAN That girl knows her stuff. ,225000
INT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS Han and Chewie divide the explosives. ,18
Talk in hushed tones. ,68100
HAN We'll set the charges at every other column. ,1930000
He GROAN/TALKS to Han, who looks around, reconsiders. ,11500
HAN (CONT'D) You're right. ,271000
That's a better idea. (checks his detonator) You take the top. (CHEWIE DOES) I'll go down below. ,434000
Detonator. ,940000
We'll meet back here. ,54500000
They head off in opposite directions. ,3920000
INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS Han finishes placing an explosive. ,34
Checks he's all-clear and hurries down to the next level. ,505000
Chewie climbs up a level. ,1290000
INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - MAIN ENTRANCE - NEAR DARKNESS A SQUAD of Stormtroopers SNAP to alert as Kylo Ren approaches. ,4
CONTROLS ARE HIT and the huge DOOR OPENS. Without hesitation, Kylo walks INTO THE OSCILLATOR. INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS A COLOSSAL CYLINDRICAL STRUCTURE. DARK CORRIDORS and CATWALKS. Kylo Ren comes to a stop. ,2
Scans the structure. ,11300000
SENSING SOMETHING, he motions the Stormtrooper Squad upwards. ,1070
KYLO REN Find them. ,1190000
They rush past him. ,45600000
Kylo Ren turns slowly, and HEADS DOWN. INT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS The Stormtroopers move up the ramp, weapons ready, checking carefully where blind corners intersect from the perimeter. ,6
They come round to the next higher level and PASS CLOSE TO CAMERA. When they've passed, TILT to find CHEWIE, in the shadows of the grillwork. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: Once they're gone, he plants another charge. ,23
EXT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS The Snowspeeder comes to a stop outside the structure. ,6
Finn and Rey stop for a moment, look to the sky: THE SUN IS NEARLY GONE. INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - LOWER LEVEL - NIGHT Han finishes setting a charge and is about to move on when he HEARS SOMETHING and conceals himself behind a wide, vertical support. ,He peaks around the edge and his whole demeanor changes -- HAN'S POV: Kylo Ren appears and stops at the railing, looking down into the filter. ,52
Han looks at his son with a tortured storm of feelings. ,438000
WE'RE WITH KYLO REN as he resumes his hunt. ,255000
He heads directly toward WHERE HAN IS HIDING! Kylo Ren has an INCREASING SENSE OF HAN'S PRESENCE as he moves closer. ,1400
He comes to where Han was hiding -- but HAN IS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN. From his hiding place in a narrow, POWER CHAMBER in the wall, HAN WATCHES HIS SON PASS ONLY A FEW FEET IN FRONT OF HIM. Han SHIFTS HIS POSITION in the tight compartment, so he can watch Ren's progress. ,2070
Kylo Ren turns onto a FLAT BRIDGE THAT BISECTS the open space. ,37300
Unaware of his father, Kylo Ren walks purposefully across to the opposite side. ,7560
Han watches his son walk off -- the CLANK- CLANK of Kylo Ren's boots receding. ,656
This is Han's opportunity to escape but Leia's words echo through his mind. ,67900
He makes a decision and moves out, to the edge of the catwalk. ,506000
He calls out, strongly: HAN Ben! The name ECHOES as Kylo Ren STOPS, far across the vast catwalk. ,1780
He turns. ,1470000
KYLO REN Han Solo. ,2640000
I've been waiting for this day for a long time. ,184000
Finn and Rey make their way into the space, opening a HATCH that allows A BEAM OF PRECIOUS SUNLIGHT to stream down like a spotlight on Han and his son. ,6110
Finn and Rey get to a railing and look down. ,6270
They can SEE and HEAR Han and Kylo Ren on the catwalk below. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: HAN Take off that mask. ,3540
You don't need it. ,1520000
KYLO REN What do you think you'll see if I do? ,340000
Han moves toward Kylo Ren. ,1160000
HAN The face of my son. ,6240000
Kylo TAKES OFF HIS MASK. Han is JOLTED -- seeing the face of his son for the first time as a man. ,1950
KYLO REN Your son is gone. ,1760000
He was weak and foolish, like his father. ,2910000
So I destroyed him. ,5260000
HAN That's what Snoke wants you to believe but it's not true. ,2520000
My son is alive. ,74000000
SEVERAL LEVELS BELOW them, CHEWIE comes to the rail to watch. ,248000
INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - LOWER LEVEL - NEAR DARKNESS Kylo flares. ,981
KYLO REN No. The Supreme Leader is wise. ,89300
UP ABOVE, Finn, Chewie and Rey watch, rapt. ,40900
Stormtroopers dot the perimeter of the structure, watching the scene. ,205000
ON THE BRIDGE, Han moves closer, stern: HAN Snoke is using you for your power. ,39300
When he gets what he wants, he'll crush you -- you know it's true. ,1120000
Kylo hesitates. ,217
Somehow, he does know it. ,3720000
KYLO REN It's too late. ,1590000
HAN No it's not. ,2960000
Leave here with me. ,292000
Come home. ,12100000
We miss you. ,54500000
For the first time, Kylo Ren seems truly conflicted. ,28700
Tears flood his stoic eyes... ,18300
KYLO REN I'm being torn apart. ,160000
I want to be free of this pain. ,54000000
INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - DARKNESS FALLS Han takes one step toward his son, but stops himself. ,939
KYLO REN I know what I have to do, but I don't know if I have the strength to do it. ,4540000
Will you help me? ,2760000
Han hears his son's voice again, pained and vulnerable. ,11600
HAN Yes. ,6240
Anything. ,18300000
Kylo Ren unholsters his lightsaber and SLOWLY EXTENDS IT to Han, within a foot of Han's chest. ,718
Han almost can't believe it. ,2200000
The moment seems to last forever. ,28400
And just then, the LAST BEAM OF SUNLIGHT streaming through the open hatch VANISHES. Han actually smiles -- and reaches out for the dark weapon -- but with the light now gone, KYLO REN'S EYES FILL WITH DARKNESS, HE IGNITES THE LIGHTSABER -- THE FIERY BLADE SHOOTS OUT, RIGHT THROUGH HAN'S CHEST AND BACK! KYLO REN Thank you. ,25
ABOVE, Finn and Rey GASP -- SCREAM -- FINN (PANTING) Solo. ,5820
REY (ALSO PANTING) No, no. ,1280000
Han's last moment is looking into his son's face. ,1200000
HAN'S KNEES BUCKLE. The blade tilts down with him... until KYLO REN EXTINGUISHES IT AND HAN HOLDS onto the catwalk -- his life slipping away. ,24
Finally Han FALLS BACK, OFF THE CATWALK, INTO THE DEPTHS OF THE STRUCTURE! INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY Leia, feeling it instantly -- knowing -- drops into a seat, DEVASTATED. INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NIGHT Kylo Ren is somehow WEAKENED by this wicked act. ,9
Himself horrified. ,3110
His SHOCK is broken only when -- CHEWIE CRIES OUT IN AGONY! Chewie furiously FIRES AT KYLO REN, HITTING HIM IN THE SIDE! Kylo Ren falls back, stunned. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: Our MUSIC TAKES OVER, EPIC AND HEARTBREAKING as Stormtroopers FIRE AT CHEWIE, who is forced to retreat down a corridor, where he holds the EXPLOSIVE REMOTE -- he PUSHES THE BUTTON! Hearing ONLY OUR SCORE, FIRST ONE, then TWO, then FOUR, then SIX EXPLOSIONS rock the structure -- CATWALKS FALL as the walls CAVE IN! Kylo Ren SEES REY AND FINN, WATCHING THE EXPLOSIONS IN SHOCK -- then they SEE KYLO REN, WHO RECOGNIZES THEM BOTH, WITH ASTONISHMENT. He rises to his full height and heads for them with long strides. ,Stormtroopers begin to BLAST AWAY AT REY AND FINN! CRAZED, REY FIRES BACK AS BLASTS HIT AROUND HER. FINN WRAPS AN ARM AROUND HER AND DRAGS/CARRIES HER OUT OF SIGHT! INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY ADMIRAL ACKBAR The Oscillator's been damaged but is still functional. ,2
COMMODORE META reacts. ,281000
OFFICER TABALA ZO Admiral, their weapon will fire in two minutes. ,24900
EXT. FOREST - NIGHT From a distance the oscillator is ablaze and fractured from the explosives. ,11800
Then Rey and Finn appear, coming over a rising, running into a bare-tree snowy forest. ,9700
FINN The Falcon's this way. ,533
Finn and Rey, overcome with emotion, race through the snowy forest -- until Finn SLOWS AND STOPS. Rey stops too, both out of breath. ,82900
They look at each other. ,376000
They both know: they can't run. ,111000000
EXT. STARKILLER BASE - FOREST - NIGHT Kylo Ren moves through the trees -- until he STOPS. Takes out the saber, ignites it. ,46
A still figure amidst the gusts of wind and snow. ,69300
STANDING THIRTY FEET AWAY, FACING HIM, ARE FINN AND REY. Finn holds LUKE'S LIGHTSABER, Rey the Stormtrooper BLASTER. KYLO REN We're not done yet. ,710
REY You're a monster! (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: KYLO REN It's just us now. ,343000
Han Solo can't save you. ,1800000
After a beat, Rey moves forward with the blaster -- AIMS IT! Kylo Ren RAISES A HAND -- Rey struggles under his FORCE POWER -- she can't fire -- he strains too, especially with the WOUND Chewie inflicted. ,36
Kylo Ren GESTURES POWERFULLY -- Rey's BLASTER FLIES OUT OF HER HAND -- another GESTURE and Rey FLIES BACK and SLAMS INTO A TREE thirty feet away! She drops -- LANDS HARD in the snow. ,61
Dazed, hurt. ,1680
FINN Rey! Rey! Rey... ,929000
Rey... ,16000000
Oh no. ,12400000
Oh no no no... ,1420000
Finn turns to her, afraid and concerned. ,825000
But the SOUND OF KYLO REN'S LIGHTSABER moving makes Finn TURN BACK TO KYLO REN, lit by the glowing YELLOW AND RED BLADE. KYLO REN TRAITOR! In reply, Finn TURNS ON LUKE'S LIGHTSABER -- upon seeing the weapon, Kylo Ren REACTS IN SHOCK. KYLO REN (CONT'D) That lightsaber. ,3
It belongs to me! FINN Come get it. ,164000
Despite his fear, Finn raises his blade in welcome. ,1320000
Kylo Ren CHARGES at him - Finn terrified -- Kylo Ren LUNGES but Finn DEFLECTS Ren's SPARK-SPITTING blade! Kylo Ren TURNS, ATTACKS, CUTS -- amazingly Finn BLOCKS, COUNTER-ATTACKS -- clearly IMPRESSES KYLO REN, who only enjoys this challenge more! Rey RECOVERS, gets her bearings. ,7
Her eyes focus on the two men fighting, through the trees. ,174000
Kylo Ren is obviously hampered by his wound, yet he attacks with a primal SAVAGERY -- Finn BLOCKS, turning DEFENSIVE moves into OFFENSIVE ones. ,7250
And he ACTUALLY GETS A HIT IN! LUKE'S SABER GRAZING KYLO REN'S ARM! Kylo MOVES BACK -- wounded, but more enraged than weakened. ,66
Kylo Ren CHARGES AGAIN -- their WEAPONS POUND, SPARKS FLY, their blades LOCK, the men are CLOSE, LIT BY the powerful, CRASHING sabers: And Kylo Ren PUSHES FINN BACK, attacks with pure ferocity -- Finn is stunned -- unprepared for this fierceness. ,14
Rey sees this -- Kylo Ren unleashes a MERCILESS SERIES OF BLOWS, pushing Finn further and further back until he loses balance. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: That's when KYLO REN STRIKES: HE LANDS A BLOW TO FINN'S TORSO -- LUKE'S LIGHTSABER FLIES FROM FINN'S HAND, THROWN TWENTY FEET! Kylo Ren TURNS OFF HIS LIGHTSABER and REACHES FOR LUKE'S LIGHTSABER -- BECKONING IT WITH THE FORCE. LUKE'S LIGHTSABER VIBRATES IN THE SNOW. Kylo Ren GESTURES, INCREASES HIS POWER -- LUKE'S LIGHTSABER FINALLY FLIES OUT OF THE SNOW, BULLETS TOWARD KYLO REN -- -- AND SPEEDS PAST HIM! KYLO REN TURNS TO SEE LUKE'S LIGHTSABER LAND IN THE HAND OF REY, WHO STANDS, FACING HIM, HAVING REACHED FOR IT HERSELF, BUT UTTERLY STUNNED THAT IT LANDED IN HER HAND! SHE IS SHOCKED -- AND SO IS KYLO REN! Holding it with both hands, SHE IGNITES LUKE'S LIGHTSABER FOR THE FIRST TIME, HER EYES BLAZING. Kylo Ren IGNITES HIS SABER. It's REY who charges now -- Kylo Ren immediately on the defensive. ,They BATTLE POWERFULLY -- He is clearly rocked by her raw, innate skill. ,12300
INT. X-WING - NIGHT NIV LEK We just lost R-1! JESS We're overwhelmed! What do we do? ,52
It isn't working! Another pilot looks down -- SEES THE EXPLOSION -- coming from the OSCILLATOR. Relatively small, it's an opening: YOLO ZIFF Black Leader, there's a brand new hole in that oscillator. ,95
Looks like our friends got in! POE Red Four! Red Six! Cover us! LT. BASTIAN I'm on it! ELLO ASTY Roger! POE Everybody else, hit the target hard! Give it everything you got! And the X-WINGS DIVE and BLAST the OSCILLATOR -- EXT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR - NIGHT Another two X-wings -- including Poe's -- soar through the trench leading to the oscillator structure! POE I need some help here! I need some help! LT. BASTIAN I'm coming in! JESS Watch out! ELLO ASTY I'm hit! The alien pilot's X-wing is blasted to pieces. ,9
POE All teams - I'm going in! Pull up and cover me! NIV LEK Copy that, Black Leader! Good luck, Poe! The trailing X-wings peel off as Poe's black fighter darts into the fiery breach. ,1630
INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - NEAR DARKNESS Outside, the SUN ALMOST COMPLETELY GONE -- PULL BACK THROUGH THE WINDOW TO REVEAL A STARKILLER TECHNICIAN: STARKILLER TECHNICIAN Weapon at full capacity in thirty seconds. ,55
GENERAL HUX Prepare to fire. ,475000
EXT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR - NIGHT Poe's X-wing weaves through the breach. ,41
A pursuing TIE fighter does not clear the gap, leaving Poe to circle the interior of the unguarded structure, firing volley after volley of torpedoes. ,30
EXT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR - NIGHT The remaining X-Wings -- including Poe's -- BLAST the place -- and the structure begins to CRATER, deep underground EXPLOSIONS! EXT. FOREST - NIGHT Amid the BARE WHITE TREES, ONLY TWO LIGHTSABERS -- LUKE'S BLUE AND REN'S YELLOW-RED -- ILLUMINATE the FLURRIES OF SNOW as Rey and Kylo Ren BATTLE HARD. She seems to be, impossibly, STRONGER THAN HE IS for half a dozen blows -- until he FINDS HIS STRENGTH and FIGHTS BACK -- MOVING FORWARD and PUSHING REY BACK, into the forest. ,16
Suddenly a COLOSSAL CHUNK OF THE FOREST RIGHT BEHIND REY DROPS AWAY! Rey is suddenly fighting on the EDGE OF A MASSIVE, BRAND NEW CLIFF! KYLO REN You need a teacher! I can show you the ways of the Force! REY The Force. ,Rey closes her eyes for a long beat. ,When Rey opens them, she is centered, fortified, and she POUNDS BACK, SINGLE HANDED SWIPES, hitting Ren's gnarly, spitting saber with incredible FORCE. It's so fast now, so furious, that Kylo Ren FALLS BACK -- She ATTACKS HARDER! Ren gets up again but she HITS HIS SABER'S HILT -- HIS BLADE GOES FLYING OFF, TUMBLING INTO THE SNOW -- and she SLASHES AGAIN AND AGAIN AND HITS KYLO REN SQUARE IN THE HEAD AND CHEST. HE GOES DOWN, SUDDENLY A FEARFUL MAN, A LARGE BURN SCAR SLASHED ACROSS HIS FACE! He still reaches for his saber. ,And she could kill him -- right now, with ONE VICIOUS STRIKE! But she stops. ,Realizing she stands on a greater edge than even the cliff -- the edge of the dark side. ,The earth SHAKES. The earth splits. ,A gully forms. ,INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT The area where the RALLY was held is now COLLAPSING into a giant sink hole! We WHIP PAN to a YOUNG TECHNICIAN, who watches this out the control room window in horror. ,He hurries off, passing COLONEL DATOO, who admonishes: COLONEL DATOO Lieutenant, get back to your station! YOUNG TECHNICIAN (stops, fleetingly) Just look. ,We won't survive -- even Hux has gone! As he hurries off, WE HEAR: GENERAL HUX (V.O.) Supreme Leader. ,INT. STARKILLER BASE - ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT Hux stands before SNOKE'S IMAGE. Relative quiet here, but distant SOUNDS OF DESTRUCTION.

By the Randomization of Housing Act. ,2850000

Look, I know ya'll ain't voting for me. ,2430000

Troy spots the white Sophomores he greeted from before who give him a head nod. ,3110000
Troy's got this. ,90
After a moment... ,1650000
MARTIN (CONT'D) Okay. ,39100
Looks like we've got ourselves a winner. (devastated) Sam White? ,448000
The blood drains from Sam's face and Troy's smile plummets into the floor as the two turn to look at each other. ,15500
TROY & SAM Oh shit. ,15300000
Reggie's grin is from ear to ear as Helmut walks over and slips a card to a still stunned Sam. ,8990
Coco watches him go. 17 INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 17 Right on the heels of Helmut's exit is... 15. ,33600

Be good at that. ,12900000

And when I graduate early with an Economics degree from Manchester it will be the crowning achievement of my Black middle class parents' ambitions. ,20200
HELMUT Conflict is a commodity in my industry. ,348000
Sam's got it. ,4080000
Do you? ,21400000
COCO So you want me to start a fight. ,11000000
HELMUT (exactly) I don't want you to do anything you wouldn't otherwise do. ,1400000
Helmut hands her his card. ,234000
A fire sparks in Coco as he exits. ,14900
He contemplates her. ,483000
Fights a growing smile. 18 INT. DEAN'S OFFICE - DAY 18 A fireplace rages behind Lionel who stares at the floor while the message plays over speaker phone. ,36900

Dean Fairbank's mind ticks away behind a concerned glare. ,87300
DEAN FAIRBANKS Most everything's locked up, but we'll find another residence to move you to. ,2480
Third time's a charm. (off Lionel's sigh) What about Armstrong / Parker? 16. ,5610
LIONEL I don't know... ,9330000
DEAN FAIRBANKS I might have an opening. ,328000
Maybe it'd be good to be around...you know. ,4270000
LIONEL Dean. ,5960
The worst thing about high school, and believe me it was a long list, were the Black kids. ,5150000
DEAN FAIRBANKS Maybe it's in your head. ,1990000
Sure, sometimes our folks can be intolerant around people like you. ,14000000
Homo -- LIONEL -- I don't believe in labels. ,2820000
Fairbanks just smiles. ,8480000
This is a sore spot and he backs off. ,5160000
Lionel glares up at a poster above Fairbank's desk: Students of all races on the steps of Ellington Library including Troy with the phrase "MANCHESTER: WHERE YOU BELONG" printed below. ,354
Troy's huge smile seems to mock him. ,312000
DEAN FAIRBANKS You like jazz Lionel? ,1010000
Manchester's like jazz you know. ,1960000
LIONEL This is a research school. ,73800000
DEAN FAIRBANKS And jazz is tension. ,1150000
The interplay of improvised solos all creating one song. ,16200000
Your problem is you've got no instrument. ,2280000
No major, no affiliations, no solo son. ,18000000
LIONEL I submit articles to the Independent Observer. ,664000
DEAN FAIRBANKS No one reads the Independent Observer, my point is are you playing swing or bebop? ,35700
LIONEL You're mixing metaphors. 17. ,126000
DEAN FAIRBANKS Are you a sax or are you a trumpet? ,2010000
LIONEL I hate jazz. ,37500
Fairbanks checks his watch. ,229000
All out of ideas. ,880000000
DEAN FAIRBANKS I'll do what I can. ,1300000
Not a word of this in the Observer okay? ,96800000
LIONEL What's it matter? ,84700000
No one reads it. 19 EXT. MANCHESTER - DAY 19 Lionel walks alone through the buzzing campus. ,41800
He looks out to.. ...a group of BLACK KIDS. He sees a version of himself amongst them - his hair a finger waved Ceasar fade, as he trades "No Homo's" with the others. ,10500
Lionel shakes it off. ,6400000
Peers over to a group of out and proud gay kids and sees a version of himself amongst them - his hair straightened and coifed in a fitted shirt laughing. ,4360
Not right either. ,238000
Where does he fit? ,101000000
By surprise... ,974000
GEORGE Lionel right? ,3310000
GEORGE PIERCE, 24, an intellectual whose tattooed quotes from Nietzsche peek out seductively from under his button up. ,7
GEORGE (CONT'D) George. ,193000
We had Civ last semester? ,5700000
How you doing? ,2430000
LIONEL Grood...Gate...I'm ah.. ,48200
GEORGE Fan of your stuff. ,45100000
In the Observer? ,2320000
LIONEL No one reads the Observer. ,193000
GEORGE You seen this? ,George hands Lionel Sam's "Missing Black Culture" flyer. 18. ,66200
GEORGE (CONT'D) The residents of Armstrong / Parker just made her head of house. ,111000
Am I crazy or is there a there there? ,3550000
LIONEL What made you come over here? ,1640000
George holds up Sam's "Ebony & Ivy." Lionel takes it. ,156000
LIONEL (CONT'D) I mean I'm glad you came -- GEORGE -- My staff? ,3040
God bless them. ,4590000
They're whiter than Michael Jackson's kids. ,1030000
We're fucked if anyone of them writes this story and I will not let the transfers at the Gazette do it first. ,117000
LIONEL The oldest one has his face. ,537000
GEORGE You're in the Black Student Union. ,31600000
You probably know Sam. ,45
Lionel shakes his head "yes" and "no" at the same time. ,4460000
GEORGE (CONT'D) You come up with a good angle? ,243000
I want it in the Bugle. ,16700000
Lionel eyes the bold "Bugle" logo on George's shirt. ,36300
LIONEL (aside) Trumpet... ,275000
GEORGE Bugle. ,2720
Focus. ,20200000
The only paper on campus with a national subscription base and an Advisor from the New York Times? ,613000
Only so many ways a person can distinguish themselves at a place like this Lionel. ,94700
You're good. ,7750000
You belong with us. ,10900000
The way Lionel fights the smile creeping up his face - we know he's never heard these words. ,34200
Never belonged any place. ,83200
Doesn't hurt there's a handsome boy smiling at him either. 19. 20 INT. ARMSTRONG/PARKER DINING HALL - DAY 20 Troy and Sam sit across from each other at a table. ,92
Their opposite facing laptops and a world of tension put a wall between them. ,304000
TROY Get it yet? ,43800000
Sam shakes her head yes. ,365000
TROY (CONT'D) Good. ,295000
You've now got the shared calendar, contacts, and official email. ,1580000
Troy throws a smirk her way before pulling out a thick stack of papers. ,10400
TROY (CONT'D) Oh and before I forget. ,31700
SAM Event requests for the year? ,131000
TROY Just this month. ,20000000
They need your approval. ,101000000
Also don't forget to pick your office hours. ,48200000
At least 20 per week. ,904000
SAM That's absurd. ,72900000
TROY You're in charge of a hundred residents now. ,41100
And they need time to complain to your face. ,309000
About noise. ,375000
Leaky pipes. ,157000
Gluten free options in the cafeteria. ,189000
Etcetera. ,2920000
SAM Troy. ,11000
I didn't think I was going to win. ,31600000
TROY And by the way petitioning the President on the Randomization of Housing Act isn't gonna do shit. ,26600
None of the other houses are concerned. 20. ,33200
SAM Because they all have a legacy of rich and powerful allies on the board who will make sure that "random" works out to their advantage. ,21000
TROY And you think a petition is going to change that? ,532000
Troy gets up to leave as Reggie sits - suspicious. ,199000
Sam's phone buzzes: "MOM." The letters chill Sam to the core. 21 INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER - DAY 21 Lionel steps his way through the hall, a deer in headlights with a notepad. ,2560
He flips through Sam's "EBONY & IVY" book... ,437000
SAM (V.O.) The Armstrong / Parker dining hall is the epicenter of Black culture as it stands at Manchester. ,94700
Only here can you commiserate, celebrate and discuss everything from Kanye West lyrics to theoretical relativism all in one sitting. ,903
Not to mention find someone who can actually do your hair. ,1060000
ARMSTRONG / PARKER DINING HALL - CONTINUOUS Lionel enters and takes a place in a line. ,38300
He absorbs this lively and somewhat alien dining hall. ,12300
Troy now holds court near the windows at a table of eight or so friends including Martin and SUNGMI, a lip ringed Korean art major. ,59500
MARTIN "We wuz robbed." That election was suspect man. ,308000
Martin glares at Reggie and his giant souped-up Laptop. ,6030
Sam breaks this by sitting back down - her phone call ending. ,1370000
SAM You call me the minute there's an update. ,28000000
Love you too mom. ,37800000
Sam hangs up. ,3900000
The call's really put her in a bad place. ,2040000
She sits at a table of her Bofros - who we'll name by their hair. 21. ,237000
CURLS There is one other sister in my Relativity class, I'll be damned if our professor doesn't call me Laretta every God damn time. ,7470
DREADS We all look the same. ,79800000
REGGIE Programming professor gets me and Martin here mixed up constantly. ,34400
MARTIN You should be so lucky. ,53500000
Reggie glances over at Martin's Mac Air. ,182000
REGGIE Cute. ,1010
You get that at Toys R Us? Sam pulls out her Mac and her student ID card. ,703000
REGGIE (CONT'D) You still using your ID number? ,220000
SAM I always forget passwords. ,618000
REGGIE You are begging to get hacked. ,65600
SAM Good thing the one evil techno- genius thinking like that is on my side. ,1360000
Sam pushes aside all the paperwork on her table. ,80600
SAM (CONT'D) So this is what the revolution looks like? ,150000
Office hours and paperwork. ,117000000
Sam pulls her camera out - starts to shoot the room. ,231000
REGGIE Winning was a happy accident. ,1460000
We want the reform repealed right? ,83300
CURLS Means to an end, sister. 22. ,2780000
Sam feels the heat of her disciples' eyes on her as the topic of the day rages on with the entrance of Coco, who sits with a group of well manicured hot-ironed group of girls, white and Black. ,2140
COCO The talented tenth always has to bust its ass a little bit harder, but I don't see the benefit in blaming white folks for everything. ,1310
CURLS Who's blaming? ,20500
TROY I don't see the issue. ,64300000
I never had one. ,556000
Never ran into any lynch mobs. ,164000
Lionel takes a seat alone facing the action. ,234000
Kurt and crew enter with plates of mac and cheese and sit in the heart of the conversation. ,852
Lionel avoids eye contact. ,1090000
SAM Lynch mob is still there. ,231000
Just re- branded itself. ,117000
TROY As what pray tell? ,48600
REGGIE The Republican party. ,122000
SAM Want to know how this world sees you? ,30000000
Go to a Young Republican's meeting and bring up Welfare. ,10800000
SUNGMI Or Immigration. ,12200000
LIONEL (aside) Or gay equality. ,3640000
KURT Bullshit. ,367
MARTIN I agree. ,15000000
Got something to add? ,15000000
KURT The biggest athletes, movie stars, hell your president is Black. (MORE) 23. ,98300
KURT (CONT'D) Sometimes I think the hardest thing to be in the American work force right now is an educated white guy. ,6610
SUNGMI You're not serious. ,12000000
KURT You guys still got affirmative action, you're set. ,187000
REGGIE This shit. ,10300000
SAM What are you doing in here? ,35400000
KURT Obama. ,412
Leader of the free world got into Harvard on affirmative action. ,1590000
Know who's not president right now? ,1030000
The guy that didn't get in. ,432000
SAM On behalf of the colored folks in the room, let me apologize for all the better qualified white students whose place we're taking up. ,33800
Kurt chuckles - a bit turned on by the argument. ,43400
SAM (CONT'D) You get lost? ,6200000
Bechet is that way. ,719000
KURT Yeah but what other dining hall gives you chicken and waffles? ,382000
Dear White People right? ,27300
Funny stuff. ,2460000
How haven't we staffed you yet? ,19000000
SAM On Pastiche? ,1390000
Your uninspired humor magazine? ,72700
KURT We're a lot more than a magazine sweetie. ,2980000
SNL staff is basically half Lampoon, half Pastiche. ,12300
Just like the network comedies. ,3020000
A flash of envy comes over Troy and Coco. 24. ,97100
SAM What gives you Clubhouse kids the right to come to our Dining Hall? ,319000
Kurt eats an exaggerated scoop of mac and cheese. ,38000
SAM (CONT'D) You don't live here. ,163000
MARTIN Sam? ,71700
What are you doing? ,5250000
SAM You can't eat here. ,1370000
Kurt eyes this new adversary. ,4130000
Enjoys a good challenge. ,4240000
TROY Chill Sam damn. ,215000
Let the man-- KURT & SAM -- I got this. ,67700000
KURT Who are you to put me out? ,472000
SAM (realizing) I'm the Head of this house. ,832000
And I'm doing things my way. ,545000
Sam shoots this last one to Martin. ,1770000
Kurt rolls his eyes to which Sam slams his tray to the ground. ,147000
Lionel scribbles down notes furiously on a notepad. ,10400
KURT You got any idea who you're -- SAM -- Yeah, I know who your daddy is. ,141000
The same one who's been pushing to break up this House for a decade. ,566000
What's wrong? ,9760000
Is he scared letting the Negroes gather in groups might start a rebellion on the plantation? ,16900
You tell him from me...he should be. ,7660000
Kurt looks into Sam's eyes and then his crew. ,198000
They want out. ,102000000
KURT Bad move. 25. ,65500000
Kurt leads his crew out of the dining hall drawing a slight snicker from Lionel which draws Sam's eyes right to him. ,356
Something sparks in Lionel. ,6620000
He takes out his phone and texts to GEORGE: "I've got the angle. ,2230000
I'm in." SAM You too. ,63900000
LIONEL Me? SAM Is this your house? ,909000
Lionel sinks - the eyes of everyone in the room on him. ,302000
Sam sits back down as a trickle of claps grow to a steady applause. ,12100
Troy and his table look around baffled. ,582000
By the caution on Sam's face it seems the first time she's ever heard this sound directed at her. ,1530000
A slight envy boils in Coco. ,34200
One last look to the room from Lionel before he slips out. ,692000
Locked out again. 23 INT. COCO'S ROOM - DAY 23 Coco scrolls Sam's "Dear White People" Youtube page. 75K Subscribers. ,3
She presses play on the latest video. ,98900000
SAM (O.S.) Dear White People, stop dancing. ,64500
Two seconds. 600K views. ,15400
COCO The fuck? ,22000000
Coco exits and opens her own "TIME AT AN IVY LEAGUE" page. 2K subscribers. ,21700
Her latest video is at 10K views. ,1660000
Alright... ,13900000
She presses record. ,1440000
Let's the camera rest on her briefly... ,818000
COCO (CONT'D) Muffins. ,6630
I hate to do it, but Imma have to get real Black with you. (comes to mind) So the other day, a girl had the nerve to fix her mouth and ask me if my hair was weaved. (after a moment) Weaved. ,1010
Weaved bitch? (MORE) 26. ,6240000
COCO (CONT'D) First of all if you're going to fix your mouth to ask me something like that, say it right please? ,91200
It's weave. ,65800
Noun. ,15400000
Present tense. ,9190000
Second of all don't assume just because you see a sister with some hair it's a weave. ,238000
Is it? ,17500000
Clearly. ,14800000
If a bitch could grow straight Indian hair directly out her own head I wouldn't have just overdrafted my account paying for this shit but that ain't your business. ,35800
Are those your lips sweetie? ,4240000
Sweet heart is that really your skin? ,5310000
These white girls and these tans I swear to God, they're starting to look darker than me. ,228000
Coco pauses it. ,83600
Her mouse hovers over the check box next to "private." Instead she plays it back...and hits "publish." She clicks back through to Sam's last video and hits "reply." As the red light on her computer's web cam turns green... ,27600
COCO (CONT'D) Dear White People. ,317000
What do I think about it? 24 INT. SCREENING ROOM - DAY 24 Sam with arms folded watches as Gabe (Sam's caller from earlier) presses play on a DVD. Horrified students watch... ...a Black and white 1920's style silent movie, complete with Dialogue Cards and dramatic PIANO MUSIC. SERIES OF SHOTS - ON THE SCREEN A) OBAMA speaks at a debate B) DIALOGUE CARD: "We are the change that we seek." C) A FAMILY in white-face go ape-shit D) DIALOGUE CARD: "HE'S READING OFF A TELEPROMPTER!!!!!!" E) More intercut footage of Obama speaking with actors in white-face reacting. ,3
Until... ,17400000
F) DIALOGUE CARD: OBAMA WINS A SECOND TERM! G) A WHITE-FACE CROWD goes nuts in the streets - scream into camera - loot buildings and shoot themselves in the head. 27. ,2360
H) Dialogue Card: "FIN" PROFESSOR BODKIN, late 40s, with a "seen it all before" demeanor hides a grin and lets the room settle. ,551
PROFESSOR BODKIN Okay. ,583000
Does anyone have any comments for Sam's "Rebirth of a Nation?" All of the kids are too scared to comment. ,10800
Except... ,15500000
PROFESSOR BODKIN (CONT'D) Gabe, go ahead. ,9340
GABE I dig the "silent movie" thing, but it's a little self-congratulatory. ,102000
Light on story and frankly thematically dubious. ,1040000
PROFESSOR BODKIN Okay. ,482000
Anybody else? ,1070000
SAM What? ,123000
SAME PLACE - MOMENTS LATER As students filter out of the class... ,136000
PROFESSOR BODKIN Sam? ,102000
SAM Before you say anything might I remind you that I sat through Birth of A Nation, Gone With The Wind, and Tarantino week without protest. ,13700
PROFESSOR BODKIN And might I remind you that I read all fifteen pages of your unsolicited essay on why Gremlins is actually about suburban white fear of Black culture. ,39
SAM The Gremlins are loud, talk in slang, are addicted to fried chicken and freak out when you get their hair wet. 28. ,59900
PRESIDENT BODKIN My only problem with your movie is that it was late. ,43200000
The silent projects were last semester Sam. ,2210000
You were supposed to have emailed your sound treatment over Summer. ,57300
SAM I've been getting footage. ,75900
PROFESSOR BODKIN This is your senior thesis Sam, where the hell is your head at? ,149000
SAM I've got Radio, BSU, this Head of House thing -- PROFESSOR BODKIN -- Do you want this? ,2530
Cause if not, don't waste my time here -- Sam pulls out the Super 8 camera from her satchel. ,8040
SAM -- Look this thing might as well be my right hand Professor. ,196000
I was busy this summer that's all. ,632000
PROFESSOR BODKIN With everything but your major? ,52800
While your peers are taking internships, making short films... ,5110000
SAM My dad. ,30100000
He's sick. ,179000000
Had to go home. ,63600000
PROFESSOR BODKIN If you need some time off, take it. ,145000
But if you want to make it to next semester -- SAM -- I do -- PROFESSOR BODKIN -- Pull it together. ,1290000
This is Manchester. ,13000000
Sam wants this. ,1150
It's in her eyes as she holds her tongue. 25 EXT. MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY - DAY 25 Sam exits the theater and spots Gabe talking to some guys. 29. ,34
SAM Thematically dubious? ,45400
GABE Well what was that supposed to be about exactly? ,51200
SAM You're thematically dubious! Gabe rolls his eyes and catches up with her. ,65800
SAM (CONT'D) Since when do TA's give critiques? ,217000
GABE You invoke Minstrelsy for shock value, but to what end? ,49300
SAM To invoke the same feeling I get when I turn on the TV and see some so-called reality star shuck and jive for ratings egged on by no doubt white producers. ,5430
Or the sassy Black secretary with no backstory or character development aside from their skin color. ,109000
GABE So it's a tit for tat? * EXT. GOODMAN MEDIA SCHOOL 2 - DAY * SAM * You're honestly saying that art * can't be reactionary? * GABE * You're reacting to a work made * almost a hundred years ago. * SAM * Yes because fear of Black men being * involved in the United States * Government is a completely * antiquated concept. ,No social * relevance whatsoever today. * GABE * Frankly I just think sometimes its * better to hold a mirror up to your * audience than to drop an * ideological piano over their head. * 30. ,10700
SAM * Frankly I just think works that * deal with the African Diaspora * through a post-modern lens are * outright rejected unless they're * handled by a white artist. * GABE * African Diaspora? ,2080
Really? * 26 INT. DAVIS HOUSE - DAY 26 The war rages as the two continue up a fleet of stairs. ,1510
SAM Blackface is alive and well in our culture. ,29900
Who primarily buys hip hop? ,21300000
Watches Housewives of Atlanta? ,771000
The same homogenized images of Black people over and over again? ,77700000
White people Gabe. ,693000
GABE Who goes to see Tyler Perry movies? ,790000
SAM We're an underfed community. ,78500000
None of this changes the fact that the vibrancy, the complexity of Black culture has been distilled into commodities and marketing schemes to be bought and sold-- GABE --to the detriment of the so called "real thing." Got it. ,617000
And into a room... ,53500000
INT. GABE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS Gabe slams the door. ,365000
SAM I am indistinguishable from the so called "urban" images used to amuse and market to white America. ,27200
GABE And the commodification of culture is uniquely oppressive to Black people? 31. ,12000
Sam nods fervently as Gabe grabs and unbuttons her jeans. ,5530
GABE (CONT'D) So when Kanye raps about Louis V and Rolexes and Classical Art, exactly what exploited pocket of Black America are those references being mined from? ,3
Sam can't get her shirt off fast enough. ,1390000
SAM On your knees. ,4370000
Gabe kneels below frame as Sam closes her eyes in ecstacy. ,8390
CUT TO BLACK. 27A INT. GABE'S ROOM - EVENING 27A Sam's eyes pop open - a startled scream escapes her lips. ,82
She's surprised at first to see Gabe beside her in bed, the outside spoon. ,12400
They're both naked. ,9780000
Her pompadour frayed. ,16700
GABE What? ,8500
You dream in "Cosby" again? ,2030000
SAM My hair was so straight. ,316000
My sweater so big. ,84600
I told you about that? ,928000
Sam's phone buzzes. ,11800000
Gabe grabs it and sees Reggie's photo pop up. ,246000
He swallows his envy and hands it to Sam. ,507000
She doesn't answer. ,2220000
Silence as it hits her voicemail. ,3850000
GABE Hey so...this whole "Head of House" thing. ,17200000
Congrats? ,8810000
SAM Yeah, it's...it's. ,13700000
GABE Weird, right? ,423000
Never took you as a student politician... ,4690000
Reggie's photo again - New Voicemail. ,799000
A regret in Sam's eyes. ,142000
SAM Yeah, well... ,86900
Sam rolls out of bed. ,2890000
Gabe thinks twice before he asks it. 32. ,498000
GABE Sam? ,4310
What are we doing? ,17300000
She badly wants to give him the answer he wants. ,9020000
Instead... ,16300000
SAM Fucking. 28 INT. STUDIO BOOTH - DAY 28 Reggie stares at Sam with stars in his eyes as she effortlessly addresses the campus in between bits of jazz. ,29700
SAM (V.O.) Dear White People. ,199000
Please stop touching my hair. 29 INT. GARMIN CLUB HOUSE - DAY 29 Lionel at an ancient oak dining room table listens to the broadcast over his laptop. ,26300
Makes studious notations... ,17500
SAM (V.O.) Does this look like a petting zoo to you? ,511000
Lionel gets an IM: "George: Hey handsome, how's the story?" To which Lionel writes: "Going great sexy." Lionel deletes "sexy" and replaces it with ":)" before hitting send. 29A BAR DIVIDE 29A Across from Lionel is Kurt flanked by his eager but self conscious right hand GORDON - and MITCH, swagged out varsity crew captain and connoisseur of all things Black culture. ,2
They wear "PASTICHE" gear, hunch over a glowing iPad and scroll through a series of student group photos in the Yearbook. ,15600
Kurt stares off into space, turns up the GANGSTA RAP playing from a nearby blue tooth speaker. ,11200
Kurt pours shots of Jack which Gordon eyes with caution. ,160000
GORDON Kurt it's three. ,12200000
MITCH Y.O.L.O. my nigga! Everyone takes the shot. 33. ,65100
GORDON We don't even have our new staff yet. ,27200000
Why are we planning this? ,16900000
KURT Everyone wants to be on our staff that's the easy part. ,3080000
MITCH We're going to make staff bids on Game Night, and the RSVP's are through the roof for that. ,70100
KURT Yeah but Halloween is our premiere party. ,2280000
The waitlist is already a hundred deep and it's going to take a lot to outdo this summer. ,8880
MITCH Cinco de Mayo was epic. ,383000
INSERT: A black and white photo of Kurt and crew dressed in Sombreros and Mexican stereotypes at a wild pool party. ,12600
The title reads... ,3530000
PASTICHE PRESENTS "WETBACK" GORDON How about the Young Republicans? ,47
KURT Too close to the Tea-Party. ,275000
INSERT: Photo of Kurt and crew dressed as famous female political conservatives - brandishing rally signs with misspellings and cups of tea. ,1740
The title reads... "PASTICHE'S TEA PARTY" MITCH Yo we need an East vs West hip hop party. ,29600
Get the honeys in here. ,1490000
GORDON "The honeys?" You're from Vermont. ,32100000
KURT Guys what's the Pastiche motto? ,109000
GORDON "Sharpen thy sword." 34. ,25600
MITCH Our motto is a euphemism for masturbation? ,42100
GORDON It's a reminder that satire is the weapon of reason. ,27500
So who on campus is being unreasonable? ,160000
MITCH Sounds like a reminder of how gay you are. ,1020000
GORDON Was that even a reasonable attempt at a quip Mitch? ,167000
MITCH Hey Gordon, say reasonable again. ,1540000
SAM (O.S.) Dear White People, knowing Lil' Wayne lyrics no longer earns you an Honorary Black Card. ,28
It just reminds me how often you say the word "nigga" when no one Black is around as is required in reciting said lyrics. ,370000
Kurt turns up his music and shoots Lionel a look, who plugs headphones into his computer and looks down. ,31800
KURT The hell does Sam think she is? ,7390000
MITCH Like Spike Lee and Oprah had a pissed off baby. ,157000
Kurt shares a glance with Mitch and Gordon - they're leaning towards the same idea. ,42600
KURT Could we? ,50
GORDON How? ,192000
Kurt turns his heat towards Lionel - has a bone to pick. ,10600
KURT Hey Lionel. ,660000
Talked to the Dean today. (MORE) 35. ,5130000
KURT (CONT'D) We had a very enlightening conversation. ,13000
I just want to say... ,21000000
I'm sorry about the voice message. 29B DINING ROOM 29B Kurt and his crew cross over to Lionel's table. ,70
Kurt unzips his pants silently. ,1770
KURT (CONT'D) Do you accept? ,163000
Lionel removes the headphones and turns to Kurt, just as he starts flopping his dick around off screen. ,373000
Lionel quickly looks in the other direction. ,124000
Kurt's friends crack up. ,192000
GORDON Please put that away. ,7110000
KURT You got to talk to these people in a language they'll understand. ,1620000
Lionel shoves his headphones back on over his fro. ,231000
LIONEL Pathetic. ,8
KURT (yelling) Wherever he ships you off to, be sure to pack a sense of humor with you, kay bro? ,38500
Lionel drowns them out. ,75300
He flips through Sam's "Ebony & Ivy" book to a section called... ,430000
SAM (V.O.) The Paper Bag Tests. ,410000
As Lionel reads we swish pan to... 30 DREAM DINER 30 ...an abstract Diner set. ,73200
Sam at the counter addresses us. ,104000
SUPERIMPOSE: THE TIP TEST SAM The Tip Test. ,3500000
You hit up Jelly's for a snack. ,3430000
Your waitress mistakes you for someone who looks like you (Black) who once ran up a thirty dollar bill and left a dollar tip. 36. ,43100
WAITRESS, over it, crosses frame and glares coldly at us. ,52500
Lionel takes a seat at a booth with Sam across from him. ,210000

Waitress huffs her way over to Lionel. ,93600
LIONEL Pastrami sandwich on rye. ,3880000
SAM ...then proceed to wait no less than forty minutes for your food. ,1740000

SAM (CONT'D) How do you tip? ,104000
A... ,124000000
LIONEL Forty minutes? ,359000
Man she's lucky I leave her forty cents. ,343000
You do a good job, maybe you'll see a tip. ,2390000
SAM B... ,281000
LIONEL Doris was tripping, but fifteen percent is the least I can do. ,12800
SAM Or C... ,38
LIONEL I reject the stereotype that African American's don't tip. ,92800
I'm leaving her twenty, no twenty five, just to prove I can! CUT TO: Lionel's back in reality. ,39500
He ponders the scenario. ,33000
LIONEL (CONT'D) C? ,168000
He turns the book upside down and reads the small print on the bottom of the page. "A) ONE HUNDRED" "B) OOFTA" and his answer "C) NOSE-JOB." 37. ,22600
LIONEL (CONT'D) Nose-job? 31 EXT. MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY - DAY 31 The campus has settled into the semester as students trudge back and forth to class. ,3510

Fairbanks eyeballs Fletcher - tension between the two. ,5820
SAM (O.S.) Turns out if you're too worried about Political Correctness to say "Black", odds are you secretly just want to call us niggers anyway and truth be told I'd rather you just be honest about it. ,2710
PRESIDENT FLETCHER Free speech my ass. ,45300000
DEAN FAIRBANKS Stalin quotes for two hundred? ,84400
PRESIDENT FLETCHER You're joking about this? ,16100

Especially after that episode with Kurt in the dining hall. ,447000
DEAN FAIRBANKS Every race issue is my issue. ,4390000
PRESIDENT FLETCHER It's a student issue. ,911000
You are the Dean of students aren't you? ,1210000
The two share an old and heated glare. 38. ,2580000
PRESIDENT FLETCHER (CONT'D) The Times has been watching us like a hawk. ,53400
Last thing we need is some "race war" on newspapers across the country. ,230000
How do you think our donor base will feel about that? ,5530000
Our fund- raiser is four weeks away. ,10900000
DEAN FAIRBANKS How bad is this deficit of yours? ,12300
PRESIDENT FLETCHER Worse. ,445000
But let me tell you something. ,27700000
If this blows up any further? ,3150000
It's on you Walter. ,1350000000

TROY (put in his place) Yes sir. ,26900000
DEAN FAIRBANKS Fletcher and I graduated a year apart. ,321000
He barely made it through. ,20500000
I graduated Summa cum Laude. ,92200
Now look who's President and who's Dean. ,76700000
TROY What's the difference? ,100000000

DEAN FAIRBANKS So you lost the House. ,67300
On to the school presidency then. ,2480000
The light in Troy's eyes dims a bit. 40. ,1120000

TROY Someone like me? 33 INT. TROY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT 33 Troy hovers over the toilet - smokes weed while the shower runs - exhales through his paper towel / dryer sheet apparatus. ,24

COCO (YOUTUBE) Muffins. ,2980000
I hate to do it, but Imma have to get real Black with you. ,4120000
Coco a bit embarrassed scans the view count. ,14400000

COCO Forty thousand views already? ,50100
GORDON Looks like someone submitted you to Buzzfeed. ,163000

SAM (V.O.) There's only a few ways a person of a color can survive at a place like this... ,730000
LIONEL Of course not. ,1400000
GEORGE Alright so then what? ,1110000

ANNIE What's the headline? ,6110000
LIONEL Outdated nationalist seeks purpose starts race war? ,3140
Lionel's joke hits, but he feels gross for saying it. ,688000
The image of Sam shaking her head in the dinner FLASHES before Lionel briefly. ,90400
GEORGE Beers in the corner. ,1420000
Bang out the news item tonight and we'll work on the profile piece for next week. ,207000
Lionel grabs a beer and takes a seat at one of the open computers. ,2730
George starts up a beat on his desk as he and Annie stare at Lionel expectantly. ,2840000
LIONEL What are you doing? ,95400
ANNIE All Bugle staffer must freestyle. ,12900
It's law. ,2270000
GEORGE You want to be a staffer right? ,334000

TROY What and Sof is the White queen? ,85300
KURT You're a pawn. ,2330000
And I think it's time you get off the board bro. ,22200000
Troy takes this in. ,4150000
KURT (CONT'D) Here's the deal. ,275000
Every year we throw a party. ,502000
The point is to mock the self important and moronic entities of the campus. ,921000
The way to get staffed is to write an invite for the party. (MORE) 52. ,1860000
KURT (CONT'D) Our invites are legendary, we make Gawker, the Post, tons of blogs every year. ,6840
If your invite is the one that goes out, you're guaranteed a spot on the staff. ,570000
The runners up are voted on by the rest of us. ,280000
Troy catches eyes with Coco who gives him a seductive glance. 45A LIVING ROOM 45A Coco turns back to her now enamored crowd. ,6780
She's in her element with these boys at her feet. ,1470000
COCO I just think having good hair and carrying on with a degree of sophistication doesn't make me a traitor to the race. ,1830
MITCH Want to know why they used to call me Black Mitch? ,5400000
GORDON COCO Absolutely not. ,232000
No one called you that. ,70200000

SUNGMI Hey, about the rally. ,4900000

Most people consider that political suicide though. ,120000
REGGIE We got to rally Sam. ,1060000
Time is now. ,20600000
SAM Use your head Reggie. ,59300000
You think a rally is going to change things? ,597000
REGGIE It'll do a hell of a lot more than a radio show or views on Youtube. ,266000
Everyone gets quiet. ,8020000
Sungmi takes this time to exit. ,18100000
REGGIE (CONT'D) Look, we got power Sam and it's time we used it. ,80300

It's almost like they recycle so much from their past - Music, food, fashion, and now turbulence. ,3520000
This leaves a bitter taste in Lionel's mouth. ,459000
GEORGE (CONT'D) Thank you so much. ,216000
Okay, take care. ,5800000
George can't fight his grin as he looks to Annie. ,12400000
ANNIE Well? ,15700
GEORGE That was our Times advisor. ,78900000
He said it's stories like these that get editors recommendation letters. ,236000
Lionel knocks on the door. ,945000
Annie and George are startled but reassured when they see who it is. 78. ,314000
LIONEL The Negro at the door didn't scare you this time. ,836000
Annie smiles and heads for the door. ,83800
ANNIE Lionel please. ,559000
You're only technically Black. ,22700000
G, going to French. ,7810000
You want me to hold your seat? ,101000000

LIONEL You need something? ,8490000
Saw your e- mail. ,86600000
GEORGE Yeah, I need someone to do the Donor's function on Saturday. ,61800
Small dinner for the school's big givers. ,49300000
Administration wants a little coverage. ,476000
LIONEL That's Halloween night. ,205000
GEORGE Right, which is why no one else will take it. ,72500000
LIONEL Ah. Thus the new guy. ,26200000
George gathers his backpack and walks over to Lionel. ,32500
Gets close. ,409000
GEORGE On my way to class, but you can stay and check out last year's piece. ,4240000
You'll do fine. ,44900000
LIONEL I don't know. ,9330000
Are there going to be any racially fueled outbursts at this thing? ,21000
GEORGE Never know right? 79. ,11400000
It's clear Lionel wants to say something else. ,3490000
George too. ,21100
LIONEL Am I a good writer? ,247000
GEORGE You'll get better. ,346000
And we need you right now. ,483000
LIONEL You're just a big recommendation away from landing the Times. ,1940000
GEORGE God I hope so. ,1100000
Lionel looks down. ,14700000
He is being used. ,43
Turns to go, just as -- GEORGE (CONT'D) Hey. -- George grabs Lionel unsure what he wants to say. ,2140
So instead he just kisses him. ,82300000
GEORGE (CONT'D) I'm glad we finally got that Bugle on your chest. ,4700
Lionel's all mixed up. ,192000
GEORGE (CONT'D) There's a big party the night of the Donor's event. ,266000
Call me after, maybe we can hang? ,50600000
LIONEL Yeah. ,1110
Sounds good. ,1110000
George heads out - leaving Lionel perplexed. 76 INT. TROY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 76 Troy stares at his reflection in a mirror as he lifts his du- rag to reveal his perfectly curled finger waves. ,650

As he reads... 80. ,5630000
KURT (V.O.) Dear White People. ,165000

Course you are. ,31400000
MONTAGE: As our subjects get ready for their evening. ,1280000
Troy goes back to combing over his finger waves, finding and correcting imperceptible imperfections. ,9

Sorry for the short notice, but let's keep it one hun-ed. ,129000
You've had us on your calendar for weeks. 76A Lionel stares into a mirror in an ill fitting suit 76A combing out his unwieldy fro. ,3410
He flinches in pain as he fluffs out each section. ,37200
KURT (V.O.) Dudes must rock FUBU, Ecko, Rocawear, or Sean John. ,2310
XXXL is the smallest size T-Shirt you can wear, preferably with a collage of Barack Obama and Tupac on it. ,86

She begins on her eyes. ,4270000
KURT (V.O.) Ladies, we need to see huge hoop earrings, long nails, and cheap tight clothes. (MORE) 81. ,56100
KURT (V.O.) (CONT'D) A proper hood rat starts fights, speaks loudly, and when she can't think of the word she's trying to say just makes one up, such as "edumicated." Feel free to fry up some chicken, bring Kool-Aid, Watermelon, 40s, Henny, and of course Dat Purple Drank. ,2
No bougie bitches allowed. 76C Sam removes the pins and the black power Afro pic holding 76C up her pompadour fro hair-do, and lets it fall flat around her ears. ,She takes in her image in the mirror. ,5550000
KURT (V.O.) Naturally there will be a freestyle rap competition so bring it, get yo shine on and join us for the party of the year! Oh and Nigga Nigga Nigga Nigga. ,53900

He smokes on Coco's one-hitter from before. ,32800
Lionel steps out in his ill fitted suit, a camera in hand. ,50100
The two are surprised to see each other. ,81900000
LIONEL Funny seeing you here. ,203000
TROY Father likes to show me off at all the Donor functions. ,204000
The dessert course is usually my cue to take a breather while they talk shop. (friendlier) The trick is to dazzle them into forking over their estates just before they kick the bucket. ,670
Lionel could just leave. ,874000
Instead he accepts the olive branch. ,61200
LIONEL So...Picard or Kirk? ,31200
TROY Kirk. ,4870
Wait... ,18500000
LIONEL I saw you watching Star -- 82. ,2190000
TROY -- Yo what happens in the crib stays in the crib. ,80800
Not trying to get my card revoked. ,110000000

TROY Yeah? ,5330
That work out for you? ,314000000
LIONEL No. No it did not. ,625000
At least not in High School. ,73800000

Prom King. ,223000
Lionel sees a sadness in Troy. ,17000
TROY (CONT'D) So what? ,292000
You're growing that out? ,526000
LIONEL I think it's gaining sentience. ,6710000
TROY It's...out there. ,22700000
LIONEL It's like a black hole for white people's fingers. ,1510000
They're obsessed. ,401000
TROY You know I cut hair. ,2300000
Why didn't you ask me? ,197000
LIONEL You're I dunno...you? 83. ,1700000

Lionel smiles and heads after his new friends. 78 EXT. KURT'S HOUSE - NIGHT 78 Lionel pauses before his old home - now filled with the chaos of a wild party. ,21400
Lionel clears his throat and heads in. 79 INT. KURT'S HOUSE - NIGHT 79 The party is dark and rambunctious. ,10300
Lots of white kids in costume. ,2390000
Some as fairies or ninjas or Spiderman - but most as pimps and thugs. ,242000
As Blaxploitation characters. ,As Barack Obama and Condi Rice. ,55700
As Shaft, Ice Cube, and 2 Chainz. ,225000
It's a lot for Lionel. ,3570000
Cups are handed to them filled with "Purple Drank." Everyone downs the stuff. ,51700
INT. GILLESPIE HALL - NIGHT Troy is being appreciated by an ancient COUPLE. TROY ...my own firm. ,9760

A buzz draws Troy's eyes to his phone - photos from "Dear White People" pop up in his news feed. 80 INT. KURT'S HOUSE - NIGHT 80 Lionel watches as Gordon and other Pastiche crew nervously put up flyers and posters. ,39
They seem caught off guard. ,829000
Lionel glances at the posters - it's Kurt with a large Afro wig mimicking Sam's "Missing Black Culture" flyers. ,513000
LIONEL This is kind of fucked up. ,68700
Right? ,25500000
GEORGE Pastiche. ,47
The world's most erudite boneheads. ,516000

Come on Lionel, help a brother out. ,261000
LIONEL Kitchen's this way. 80A ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS 80A Coco enters the party - blinged out like Nicki Minaj. ,8
She's feeling herself as she's handed a drink. ,4410000
She's got eyes on her - for the first time like this at a party. ,4180000
But she sees the same thing Lionel saw. ,285000
Her confidence starts to fight a shame that creeps up beneath her party face. ,40900
She switches her iPhone to video mode... ,978000
COCO Hey there muffins. ,258000
How do I look? ,12500000
Why are white folks so obsessed with being Black? ,147000
And why are Black folks so addicted to Blonde Barbie doll weaves? ,71100
Honeys it's a strange symbiosis we're here to explore... ,192000
Coco's voice cracks as she stares into her own image on her iPhone. ,42900
She pauses it and takes a breath. 80B HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 80B Lionel leads George through the dense crowd towards the kitchen - George pulls Lionel into a hallway and into... 80C BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 80C ...the bathroom and up against the door. ,3

LIONEL It's okay. ,3630000
Can't wait to cut all this off. ,65800000
GEORGE Don't you dare. ,6390000
George plunges his fingers into Lionel's fro once again. ,20400
Pulls a touch too hard. ,77200
GEORGE (CONT'D) I could eat you like a Hershey's. ,147000
This sets something off in Lionel. ,1320000
LIONEL I'll be right back. ,758000
Lionel breaks George's grasp and heads out the bathroom... ,257000
LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS ...and back out into the party. ,2590000
He's trapped in a nightmare of caricatures and reveling students. ,17000
Can't breathe. ,1790000
EXT. KURT'S HOUSE - NIGHT Lionel squeezes his way outside. ,37600
Something goes off in his head as he starts walking away from the party. ,168000
Just then Kurt arrives in front of the house with some friends. ,1560000
Looks at Lionel then at the house. ,5140000
KURT What the hell? 81 INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER - NIGHT 81 Lionel paces the halls. ,51700
His mind churns as he passes the dining hall. ,40100
Sam and Reggie are engaged in something intense. ,106000
DINING HALL SAM For a genius dude you're a fucking idiot. 86. ,68400
REGGIE I did it, we did it for you. ,1870000
SAM I didn't ask for it Reggie. ,37200
I look like I betrayed this house. ,407000
REGGIE Yeah? ,2360
Well you betrayed me. ,2200000
Sam gets up and storms out - brushes past Lionel. ,33400
LIONEL Sam? ,2910
Can we talk? ,1570000
Sam turns back around fiercely. 82 INT. KURT'S HOUSE - NIGHT 82 A turntable is uncovered and rolled out - as a DUDE DRESSED LIKE SERENA WILLIAMS starts up a MYSTIKAL record. ,15
The crowd starts to get live now. ,294000
Coco continues to make her way through the party - her face visibly perturbed by the time she reaches the kitchen. ,24
She continues out back... 83 EXT. KURT'S BACKYARD - NIGHT 83 ...and sits pulling out a cigarette. ,34200
She sees Annie put on a long straight Black wig and brag to friends... ,190000
ANNIE Hey who am I? "Bitch it's weave. ,1870000
Present tense ho!" Right in the gut. ,8440000
She's playing Coco. ,4110000
Coco grabs her phone... 84 INT. KURT'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 84 Kurt stumbles about the party in a daze. ,4720

LIONEL Have you heard you yelling? ,1660000
SAM This house is filled with folks willing to take up after a cause Lionel. ,43800
Believe me. ,4830000
Never would have guessed you'd be one of them but... ,13000000
LIONEL For the first time in my life, I can't just sit around and do nothing. ,4320000
How can you? ,10300000
SAM If I'm caught being a part of anything like this...it wouldn't be good for me right now okay? ,1710000
Lionel gets up and walks towards the door. ,6700000
SAM (CONT'D) I'm done being everybody's angry Black chick. ,23200
Sam looks down as Lionel gets up and heads out. ,2270000
Sam's focus shifts to her Super 8 resting by the door and then to a bullhorn directly across from it. ,9110
Her mind ticks. 86 INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER HALL - NIGHT 86 Lionel exits and paces down the hall. ,77
He walks by the dining room - taken over by Reggie, the BoFros, and a mix of other students mostly from ARMSTRONG / PARKER. 86A DINING HALL - CONTINUOUS 86A Lionel gingerly walks in the room. ,195
He's still an outsider here - but something's changed in him. 88. ,6070000
LIONEL Hey. ,1500
How's it going. ,33200000
Hi. No one answers him - just stay to their own conversations. ,2690000
Lionel spots a familiar face...Sungmi. ,11200
LIONEL (CONT'D) Hey...what is this? ,24900
SUNGMI Black Student Union. ,9060000
Lionel smiles shyly. ,261000
He should've known that. ,4130000
Reggie, Curls, Dreads and the Bofros hang out at the front. ,4360
DREADS Your call then man. ,75800000
REGGIE (to everyone) Alright ya'll - thanks for coming out tonight. ,131000
Looks like Sam's not making it so...let's just call it. ,4010000
The crowd starts to talk amongst themselves, get up and leave. ,951000
Just then Lionel stands and before he can think... ,31800000
LIONEL Uh. Excuse me. ,4600000
Hi. I'm Lionel. ,4070000
Some of you...none of you probably know me. ,46100000
I've never been to a meeting. ,208000
But I just came back from a party on campus and I think you should know about it. ,4790000
Lionel's nerves can be heard in his voice now. ,90200
He's got the judging eyes of the room fixed silently on him. ,39400
He sees an open laptop on a desk. ,562000
LIONEL (CONT'D) Anybody mind if I? ,3350
Reggie shifts a bit as Lionel goes to the laptop and pulls up the party on Facebook. ,19100
The crowd gathers around as Lionel browses through the photos. ,13000
LIONEL (CONT'D) I mean...I don't know. ,214000
This is fucked up right? ,113000
REGGIE Alright brother. ,1320000
What's the plan? 89. ,288000000
Lionel realizes the eyes aren't judging. ,382000
They're mobilizing. ,4980000
Readying for action. ,681000
Lionel steels himself. ,44200
LIONEL We go over there. ,170000
CURLS Think there's enough of us? ,987000
SUNGMI You know you don't have a monopoly on being a pissed off minority. ,46400
Latino's United is meeting across the hall. ,170000
Asian American League too. (off the stares) You guys got better snacks. 87 INT. GILLESPIE HALL - NIGHT 87 Troy scrolls through an endless amount of Facebook uploads from the party. ,5
Forties, bad Afro wigs, fake asses. ,2610
Shoved in between two RICH OLD WELL TO DOS at a long table covered in empty plates and glasses - Troy looks across to his father, in mid exaggerated guffaw with President Fletcher. ,22
TROY Dad... ,2090
DEAN FAIRBANKS Not now Troy. ,311000

There's something happening on campus. ,17000000

DEAN FAIRBANKS You're being rude son. ,1010000
Dean Fairbanks turns away. ,280000
Troy ponders a moment and then-- TROY Oh am I? ,431000
How about I tell your precious donors and anyone here who'll listen about the kind of a school it is they're giving to? ,1810000
The Dean can feel the eyes of the Donors and the President on him - an outrage comes over him as he pulls Troy aside. 90. ,61000
DEAN FAIRBANKS I don't know who you think you are young man but you don't get to talk to your father any kind of way. ,2540000
TROY All I say to you is yes sir and no sir! Look I should've brought this up before but -- (off Fairbanks dismissal) -- listen to me! Dean Fairbanks tries to cover this moment with a smile. 88 INT. KURT'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 88 Kurt, still dazed, huddles with his core Pastiche group. ,5700

Lionel sinks from this attack while his posse from BSU watches helplessly as the party goes back into full swing. ,1080
Lionel turns to go and spots... ...George who joins Annie, fresh beer in hand. ,63800
But right behind George is... ...Sam, having just arrived with her camera in hand pointed at the rap battle. ,2010
She winks at Lionel. ,451000
Lionel turns around - summons something from deep inside. ,39300
Lionel steps onto the DJ platform and snatches the mic out of one of the rapper's hands. ,48300
LIONEL Heyyyy! Hoooo! Heyyy! Hooo! 92. ,814
The crowd is with it - thinks it's part of the show as Lionel proceeds to freestyle terribly... ,39900
LIONEL (CONT'D) My name is Lionel, Some people call me Li. Lots of people think that I talk kinda white. ,97500
Well that's alright. ,91100000
Yeah that's cool. ,97200
I'd rather you think I'm white, than tap dance for you. ,456000
With that Lionel takes the mic and SMASHES it on the wall. ,22400
He then takes the turntable by his hands and flips it over. ,81100

Yo this is how we get down. ,55000000
If you can't take a joke in this day and age? ,94500000
The fact we can joke about it proves we've moved on you feel me? ,1040000
This is an attack on free speech! We're the victims here! CUT TO: 93A A series of Busts have been PAINTED IN BLACK FACE outside 93A of Armstrong / Parker where Lionel address the camera... ,88900
LIONEL It's hard enough for us to even get into a school like this. ,3690000
Let alone succeed. ,2230000
Find our way. ,88900000
This is only a debate because of who Kurt's dad is, which just proves the point. ,1700000
All you did was have a radio show and look what happened to you. ,107000000
CUT TO: 93B COCO as she talks directly to camera. 93B COCO I know this may come as a shock, but nobody gives a fuck about no Harriet muthafuckin Tubman...they wanna be us. ,4

TROY Of course I got my dad involved. ,14100000
It was the right thing to do. ,38500000
I didn't mean for all this to happen. ,1030000
All the posters and everything. ,8800000
SAM (O.S.) But you'd welcome it? ,40400000
A shot for school president. ,31900000

CUT TO: 93D RADIO BOOTH - where Sam puts her headphones on. ,65400
She 93D lingers. ,1380
SAM (V.O.) Even though I'd been expressly forbidden to do so, I wanted to do one last show. ,428000
Something to sum up the moment. ,4400000
To savor in the pop of the post racial bubble just burst. ,107000
SAM Dear White People... ,27300
SAM (V.O.) I wanted to react. ,484000
Sam takes in a thoughtful breath before... ,

She fades in a melancholy piece of Be-Bop before hanging her headpones up as the title on the projected movie fades in: "...BLACK FACES BY SAMANTHA WHITE" Sam stares nervously at the screen as the lights come on, when all at once the room BREAKS INTO APPLAUSE.

DEAN FAIRBANKS But you wanted to be? ,387000

I told you about the party, remember? ,835000
CUT TO: DEAN FAIRBANKS 94 The invite came from the Pastiche 94 Facebook account. ,31000
KURT I loathe Facebook. ,25900
An OFFICIAL whispers something in Fairbanks' ear. ,26200
KURT (CONT'D) You've got to believe me. ,13400000
DEAN FAIRBANKS You've used that line on me before this year Mr. Fletcher. ,55100

LIONEL To stop it. ,3140000
DEAN FAIRBANKS By any means necessary? ,4700000
LIONEL Someone once told me...Manchester is like jazz. ,1940000
I don't know much about jazz. ,11000000
But from what I can tell, when your solo's up, you better blow. ,113000000
Fairbanks fights a smile. ,5920000
CUT TO: 94C SAM 94C All I did that night was hit record brother. ,404

CUT TO: 94E The Dean tries a different password. ,75600
Still invalid. 94E CUT TO: 100. 94C SAM 94C Fascinating. ,3020
DEAN FAIRBANKS Well what's interesting is how easy it was to access the group before the note was sent. ,331000
The password was "Pa$tiche" spelled with a dollar sign according to Kurt. ,3050000
Seems recently it's been changed. ,12000000
CUT TO: 94E The Dean tries one more. ,5120000
It works. 94E CUT TO: 94C DEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT'D) 94C Couldn't figure it out at first. ,4
Then I thought to try something. ,
Five, seven, eight, three, five, twenty six, one, nine, four, six. ,2170000
Eleven numbers. ,7840
Just like our student ID numbers. ,54900000
Just like your student ID number. ,28800000
SAM As much as you hate him, you will stop at nothing to protect your master and his boy. ,1040000
DEAN FAIRBANKS Did you send out the invite Sam? ,320000
SAM That invite, whoever sent it should've been met with derision and outrage. ,42500
Instead, a hundred people showed up and they pulled out posters and decorations and costumes they'd made for just such an occasion. ,83600
Sam and Dean Fairbanks at a stalemate. ,346000
Silence falls in the room. ,58100
The Dean's mind ticks. 95 EXT. MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY - DAY 95 A pack of EMERALD BUGLE newspapers hit the stand with the headline: "INVESTIGATION INCONCLUSIVE! FLETCHER GOES FREE. NO EXPULSIONS MADE" 101. ,806
Next to it is another stack of papers from the INDEPENDENT OBSERVER. The headline reads: "EBONY & IVY: CAN THERE BE HARMONY? BY LIONEL HIGGINS." George picks up a copy of the Observer and starts to read... 96 INT. TROY AND LIONEL'S APARTMENT - DAY 96 Lionel flips through his own article as well. ,47600
A satisfied grin on his face as a razor makes its way through his hair. ,32900
LIONEL 2 Chainz? ,1880000
Shaft? ,14200000
While endless complex depictions of whites, white men in particular exist - there aren't that many versions of us in the culture. ,6820
His locks waft towards the ground as Troy styles a fresh and fearless fro-hawk atop Lionel's head. ,18800
LIONEL (CONT'D) Culture has a powerful way of telling people what they can and can't be. ,4590000
For people of color the options are rather limited. ,3470000
TROY Next James Baldwin up in here. ,608000
Wait hold on a sec. ,133000
Star Trek is back from commercial break. ,1940000
Troy and Lionel watch in silence. 97 EXT. MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY - DAY 97 Gabe is just about finished with Lionel's article too. ,22300
Looks up just in time to see... ,56900000
GABE Hello Sam. ,532000
Sam sneers at his formalities. ,350000
GABE (CONT'D) Read about Armstrong / Parker. ,148000
SAM Yeah. ,17900
Prez made an executive withdrawal. ,41500
Armstrong stays Black. ,5680000
GABE Congrats? 102. ,543000
SAM (with a shrug) Getting too dramatic man. ,137000
Thinking about getting an apartment off campus. ,42500000
GABE Sam going against the grain? ,146000
Shocked. ,10200000
How's papa White? ,5060000
SAM He's recovering. ,339000
Gabe fights the urge to hug her. ,197000
SAM We were actually on the phone last night for hours. ,1830000
First time we talked since the bypass. ,2250000
He was putting up a strong front. ,51700
Teasing me about being so worried. ,352000
Then came the stories about me as a little girl I'd heard a thousand times. ,1950000
About how independent I was. ,4910000
Gabe smiles politely. ,86800
Senses she needs a moment. ,828000
GABE Want to talk about it? ,215000
SAM My mother worked nights so he would take me to school. ,2550000
And it pissed me off because he would follow me all the way to homeroom. ,1860000
Every time he tried to hold my hand I'd scream and pull away. ,612000
He thought I was just being...difficult. ,4210000
A hint of recognition in Gabe. ,3370000
Is this about them? ,9
SAM (CONT'D) But it was the kids. ,403000
And the parents and the teachers. ,6500000
They'd see this Black girl and this white man and wonder what we were doing together. ,1720000
Even at nine I could feel their eyes on me. ,8550000
Especially at nine. ,31
It brought tears to my eyes. ,1620000
Gabe's stone face melts at this. 103. ,39200
SAM (CONT'D) I was just a bratty girl, didn't know any better but-- The thought of losing him-- You know? ,36800
I just feel so bad. ,689000
How awful am I to do that to him? ,131000000
To anyone I love? ,7480000
Gabe gets it. ,970000
This is an explanation. ,2310000
An apology, to him. ,5200000
His arm is on her shoulder now. ,5000000
GABE I'm sure he forgives you. ,23800
SAM Think so? ,1310
Gabe nods. ,1210
Sam's normal defenses come back up lest she cries. ,44900
SAM (CONT'D) So anyway. ,331000
I didn't mean to say all of that. ,68000000
I don't know why I did. ,119000000
GABE Sam. ,4360
Where are you going? ,31200000
SAM I don't know. ,9340000
Lunch? ,16700000
Gabe starts to walk with her. ,144000
GABE Isn't it Mac and Cheese day at Armstrong/Parker? ,462000
SAM Think they'll let you in? ,28700000
Gabe smiles. ,1530
They walk a bit. ,41200
Then he grabs her hand. ,1440000
Sam lets the moment happen. ,1840000
Squeezes his back. ,1720000
They look into each others' eyes. ,1410000
Don't even notice as Reggie and the Bofros pass them by. 98 INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 98 Coco sits across from Helmut. ,20500
He's got his eyes on a Youtube clip from Sam's movie featuring Coco. ,311000
COCO (YOUTUBE) I know this may come as a shock, but they don't give a fuck about no Harriet muthafuckin Tubman... 104. ,2030
HELMUT Two hundred thousand views. ,9920
Look they even auto-tuned it. ,3400000
With a click Helmut pulls it up. ,16000000
AUTOTUNED COCO (YOUTUBE) Muthafuckin Tubman! Muthatfuckin Tubman! Don't give a fuck about no muthafuckin Tubman! Coco's not sure what to think. ,
HELMUT Couple months, that's how long shooting for an episode takes. ,289000
We recommend you cut your course load in half to accommodate the schedule. ,166000
COCO Half? ,3560
HELMUT Trust me it it'll read "full-time" in the episode. ,14100000
If...once we go to series, we might have to figure out a summer schedule. ,4970000
COCO For shooting? ,9150000
HELMUT For uh...classes and stuff. ,561000
Won't be graduating early anymore sweetheart. ,2400000
Helmut shifts a contract over to Coco. ,6240
HELMUT (CONT'D) Five grand for the episode. ,2790
Twenty each if you get picked up for series. ,73000000
What do you say? ,5750000
Coco stares at the contract and back at Helmut. ,58800
HELMUT (CONT'D) Trust me sweetie it's the same out there as it is in here. ,215000
Good news is? ,3180000
Against all that damn white you and I? ,471000
We pop. ,134000
Think I wanted to be the go-to producer for all things Black? 105. ,50600000
Coco shrugs. ,823
HELMUT (CONT'D) Tell you what's worse though. ,216000
Being that broke Nigga stuck on the south side of Chicago. ,340000
Hundred and Fiftieth street. ,148000
Coco takes a deep breath. ,2340000
Stares right into his eyes -- 99 EXT. MANCHESTER - DAY 99 Coco exits a building and spots Troy up ahead. ,912
He's flanked by his former enemies turned supporters, Reggie and the other BoFros. ,7800
They all carry Troy's "New Hope" posters. ,613000
COCO Made some new friends? ,78300
Troy shrugs as Coco grabs for his hand. ,87900
He pulls away and shares a glance with Reggie, who doesn't approve. ,147000
COCO (CONT'D) Fine. ,79800
TROY Come on Coco. ,5590000
COCO Fuck you. ,52
Coco starts to walk ahead. ,1450000
TROY My dad saw your videos. ,14300000
He's a little worried about -- COCO -- how it'll look. ,2120000
With your campaign and all. ,17400000
What's your best friend Reggie think? ,51000000
Troy motions for Reggie to go on ahead. ,532000
TROY We had fun, alright? ,1950000
COCO I get everyone else wants you to win Troy. ,2000000
But do you? ,2750000
Troy doesn't know how to answer that. ,4550000
He stares at the triumphant, winning version of himself on his poster. 106. ,399000
Coco's eyes shift longingly as she walks ahead - unsure of who she is at the moment and who she will be in the next. ,10500
Watching her is Lionel and Sam - sitting with Gabe and Sungmi. ,45900
They both know that look well... ,822000
SAM Hey Lionel. ,644000
With me out and Troy moving on - A/P's going to need a new head of house. ,315000
LIONEL Think there's a story there? ,1520000
Who do you think it'll be? ,1100000
Sam and Sungmi share a glance and stare right at Lionel. ,17900
LIONEL (CONT'D) What? ,133000
No. SUNGMI Everyone loves you. ,166000000
Won't be hard to rally the vote. ,1380000
SAM Yeah. ,17100
We got you man. ,54700000
Lionel takes in this moment. ,4470000
One of complete acceptance. 100 INT. FLETCHERS OFFICE - DAY 100 Fairbanks turns from the window in Fletcher's office to join him at his desk. ,12800
They're all ears as they look across to... ,10900000
HELMUT Let me get this straight. ,378000
First you tried to break up the Black house. ,123000000
Then you took down the sister with the little radio show. ,8660000
And after all that, your kid throws a Blackface party? ,50900000
FLETCHER Now wait a minute! HELMUT You thought you were having money problems before? ,42300
Wait till cable gets their hands on this story. ,176000
Bill Maher is gon' fuck you up! FLETCHER I have heard enough -- 107. ,55100
HELMUT -- Wait I'm sorry. ,277000
Look from where I'm sitting this place is a goldmine. ,7980000
DEAN FAIRBANKS What? ,8390000
HELMUT For one we got to show the events that led up to the party -- DEAN FAIRBANKS -- That already happened. ,177000
HELMUT Well yeah, but we can reenact -- DEAN FAIRBANKS -- reenact? ,36600
HELMUT Documentary term...Look, I can start putting together an overall deal today. ,154000
I'm talking real money! Turns out the one thing America likes in it's reality more than ignant Black folks, is crazy racist White people! DEAN FAIRBANKS Now you look here. ,671
This is an honorable institution. ,10400000
The idea that we would so much as entertain this suggestion -- Fletcher holds his hand up. ,3720000
His turn to speak. ,1400000
FLETCHER How much we talking? ,3240000
Fairbanks' outrage turns to resignation as Helmut, the one winner here smiles. ,13400
Dollar signs in his eyes. ,7180000

Max Frye & Dan Futterman INT. UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN GYM - VERY EARLY MORNING MARK SCHULTZ (27, 180 lbs., cauliflower ears) lifts a human- sized, leather WRESTLING DUMMY from the mat to stand in front of him. ,619000
He performs a series of repetitive moves - hooking one arm under the dummy's arm, then the other; one side, then other. ,12400
Again and again. ,9980000
It looks almost as if he's dancing gently with it. ,583000
Then, very fast, Mark spins quickly around behind the dummy, grabs it in a bear hug, arches his back, lifts and SLAMS it to the mat, landing on top. ,5540
QUICK CUTS: Mark spinning, lifting and slamming the dummy - first one way, then the other - first one hold, then another - SLAM. SLAM. SLAM. SLAM. SLAM - over and over and over again. ,25100

He's freshly showered, wears a short-sleeve dress shirt, clip- on tie, slacks. ,85200
He reaches behind the front seat and pulls out a battered BROWN VINYL BRIEFCASE. CUT TO: INT. BARABOO SCHOOL/PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE WAITING ROOM - DAY Mark waits alone in a chair he's much too big for, his brown vinyl briefcase on his lap. ,5

An audience of 4th, 5th and 6th graders. ,3510000
MARK Why do I do it? ,97000000
Why do I push myself to my limits - of pain, of exhaustion - every day of my life? ,2540000
Why do I wake up every morning and make the commitment? ,2400000
Why do I do it? 2. ,576000000
The students are open-mouthed - they have no idea what to make of him. ,27100000
Mark's not being willfully over-the-top with these kids. ,1770000
This is just what's on his mind. ,8140000
All the time. ,9350000
MARK (CONT'D) In 13 months - if I train right, if I push myself - I'll be going to Seoul - that's a city in South Korea. ,696
Does anyone know why? ,840000
Because that's where the Olympic games are. ,1410000
Mark reaches into the briefcase at his feet and pulls out a RIBBON with a MEDAL dangling from it. ,47200
MARK (CONT'D) Does anyone know what this is? ,439000
As a couple of kids start to raise their hands -- MARK (CONT'D) Olympic gold medal. ,12000
I won it three years ago at the `84 Games in Los Angeles. ,425000
My brother, Dave Schultz - my best friend, my older brother, my best friend - won one too, just 23 hours and 16 minutes before I did. ,67700
That's unprecedented - two brothers winning at the same Olympics. (THEN) Would you like me to win another one? ,102000
Would you like me to win another gold medal - for us, for America? ,1080000
Would you like to see me and my big brother - Dave Schultz - both win gold medals? ,66400
Who here wants to see the two brothers win again? ,493000
A couple of the kids tentatively raise their hands. ,3050000
The rest are completely frozen. ,4750000
MARK (CONT'D) Well we're going to give it absolutely everything we've got. ,101000

FAST FOOD KID Extra meat costs extra. 4. ,569000
MARK Where's it say that? ,
FAST FOOD KID I don't know. ,688000

CUT TO: INT. UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN GYM - AFTERNOON DAVE SCHULTZ (31, bearded, intelligent, 163 lbs., strong, fierce, but calm), Head Coach of U of W wrestling, stands on the wrestling mat speaking VERY QUIETLY with 3 or 4 select WRESTLERS from the team. ,
We can't quite hear what Dave is saying to them, but we can sense immediately the reverence and deep respect they have for Dave - one of the country's top wrestlers and great coaches. ,726
The scene gives off the feeling one might have watching a horse whisperer with a small group of stallions. ,13700
Whatever he's saying, they are calmed by him, pay absolute attention, will do whatever he asks. ,551000
CUT TO: INT. MARK'S APARTMENT - EVENING A cheaply built 70s-era structure, where Mark inhabits two small rooms with a cheap kitchenette built into the wall of one of them. ,17
A particle-board BOOKCASE houses a little SHRINE of Mark's medals - and PHOTOS of him and Dave. ,94
Mark retrieves his briefcase from inside the garbage bag and extracts his GOLD MEDAL. 5. ,396
He replaces it in the PLASTIC DISPLAY CASE on the top shelf, next to the photo of him and Dave smiling with their gold medals around their necks. ,3310
CUT TO: INT. MARK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT Mark dumps a package of TOP RAMEN NOODLES into boiling water. ,23400

CUT TO: EXT. FIELD AND HILL NEXT TO CAR DEMOLITION YARD - MORNING Mark runs through knee-high weeds dragging a CAR TIRE attached to a rope behind him. ,32300
He reaches a hill and heads straight up, dragging the tire all the way - MARK (V.O.) Coach Teller? ,8430
This is Mark Schultz-- CUT TO: 6. ,471000
INT. MARK'S APARTMENT - DAY An ink-stained directory of Wisconsin Public Schools lies open on the kitchen table. ,72100
MARK (ON PHONE) I won a freestyle wrestling gold medal at the `84 Olympics. ,77100
Mark, the phone tucked against his shoulder, slips a BLANK TAPE into a cheap VCR. He slides a HAND-LABELED TAPE into a second VCR, wired to the first. ,6430
We can read the label: "THE MARK SCHULTZ WRESTLING CLINIC." He starts making a copy. ,354000
MARK (ON PHONE) (CONT'D) I'm arranging a clinic in your area next weekend, and I wanted to invite you and some of your wrestlers to join... ,27800
JUMP CUT TO: MARK (ON PHONE) (CONT'D) That's Dave, my brother. ,380000

Okay - well, good luck with your season, coach. ,11400000
JUMP TO: On the screen is a montage of highlights from Mark's career: take downs, pins. ,555000

JUMP TO: MARK (ON PHONE) (CONT'D) S-C-H-U-L-T-Z.... ,568000

Mark throws Karabajak to the mat. ,10
Pins him. ,44400
Walks away, arms raised. ,1510000

EXT. MARK'S APARTMENT/OUTSIDE WALKWAY - EVENING Mark's outside at the second floor railing of this two-story stucco building, looking out over the bleak landscape: a 7- 11, an Auto-Zone. ,1850
He eats a hard-boiled egg. ,1780000
He watches a CAR pull into the lot below. ,3960000
Dave gets out, looks up. ,30400
DAVE Where were you today? ,407000
CUT TO: INT. MARK'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER Dave fills two mismatched glasses with tap water from the faucet. ,3550
DAVE How far'd you run? ,50000
Mark's on the tattered couch. ,209000
He shrugs, though we should see that he loves the fact that Dave is concerned about him. ,97500
DAVE (CONT'D) More than ten? ,418000
Dragging weight the whole way? (Dave turns off the water) You're a sick fuck, you know that? ,17200
Dave turns to look at Mark, sitting in the bare living room. 8. ,237000
DAVE (CONT'D) Place is looking good, by the way. ,123000
I like what you've done with it. ,8
Dave notices the Public Schools Directory on the table. ,3690000
DAVE (CONT'D) You setting up clinics? ,181000
MARK Talked to some coaches. ,8250000
Dave comes toward Mark, handing off a water glass, dragging the folding chair over to sit across from him. ,37400
DAVE I hope you don't have anything booked for Saturday. ,465000
MARK Why? ,104000
DAVE I need a favor. ,160000
This school called me months ago to do a gig but now I can't. ,2250000
Nancy's got a thing all day so I gotta watch the kids. ,522000
You free? ,12900000
MARK I'll check. ,847000
He goes into the bedroom, looks at the calendar. ,354000
There's NOTHING WRITTEN DOWN for any of the days. ,79300000
MARK (CONT'D) You said Saturday or Sunday? ,419000
DAVE Saturday. ,13900
MARK Saturday could work. ,360000
He comes back in. ,21400000
DAVE Good. ,40500
Dave looks at the BACK OF HIS HAND, where he's written down a name and phone number in MARKER. He grabs one of Mark's VHS labels and a pen and writes the information. 9. ,47300
DAVE (CONT'D) Coach Vinson, Radnor High. ,192000
I'll let him know you'll call tomorrow. ,23900000
He peels off the label and slaps it on Mark's leg. ,669000
DAVE (CONT'D) And Mark. ,508000
Please come back to the gym. ,32900000
You don't have to do anything with the team. ,1650000
Just train with me. ,54500000
Mark's just looking at his older brother. ,290000
DAVE (CONT'D) I need you there. ,70300000
Stay focused on what's important. ,88900000
For both of us. ,2010000
Seoul's the goal. ,967000
Then, Mark nods at his brother. ,55900
MARK Seoul's the goal. ,210000
CUT TO: INT. RADNOR HIGH SCHOOL GYM - DAY Seven HIGH SCHOOL BOYS plus a couple of PRE-TEENS, all in wrestling gear, sit on the mat in front of Mark. ,49
He seems manic, evangelical, not tuned into his audience. ,3170000
MARK The minute you step on the mat, you are exactly who you are. ,4330000
You can't hide. ,8250000
You can't pretend you trained harder than you did, you want it more than you do. ,1160000
My brother Dave and me care about this more than we care about anything. ,29800000
The difference between the number one guy in the world and the number four guy is paper thin. ,2640000
The one who wins is the one who wants it more, who's willing to sacrifice, who can take the pain. ,481000
I can take the pain. ,40
My brother Dave can take the pain. ,2330000
Can you take the pain? ,29
Blank looks from the teenage wrestlers. ,99300
Mark gestures to a table set up near the door, on which is his OPEN BRIEFCASE, with a stack of TAPES. 10. ,14900
MARK (CONT'D) I talk about all this in my instructional videotape - which you can purchase at the end of the day for a nominal fee. ,2110
CUT TO: INT. UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN GYM - DAY Mark exits the locker room in his wrestling gear, heading for the MATS. Dave's in his wrestling gear, on the far side of the gym, talking with TWO MIDDLE-AGED MEN in blazers with USA WRESTLING INSIGNIA. Mark walks onto the mat, waits for him. ,29
Dave and the two men see Mark, WAVE to him - but Mark pretends not to notice, busies himself loosening his wrists, hands, neck. ,9270
Dave walks over to him. ,13
DAVE You remember Fred Cole from USA Wrestling. ,354000
The men walk up behind Dave. ,196000
FRED COLE Hey there, Mark, how you been? ,57100
Mark sort of nods, but doesn't really respond. ,7430
FRED COLE (CONT'D) (beat, then turns to Dave) All right, Dave. ,95000
Let us know if we can count on you. ,2880000
We'll talk soon. ,353000
Dave nods. ,2320
They walk away. ,10200000
Then Dave turns back to Mark. ,40800
MARK You been calling me and hanging up? ,34300000
DAVE (adjusting his knee brace) No. What do you mean? ,749000
Mark doesn't answer, just stands looking at him. ,5030000
For several seconds, they look at each other. ,48000000
Then, slowly at first: They start to circle each other. ,3210000
We sense immediately their differences: Dave's hunched and not very muscular physique belies his quickness and enormous strength. 11. ,2570
Mark's defining characteristic is brute force. ,95000
A weight class heavier than Dave, he can NEVER SEEM TO BEAT HIS OLDER BROTHER. The wrestling becomes intense and violent - Mark's head slams into Dave's nose, drawing BLOOD. This only energizes Dave, who slams Mark to the mat - dripping blood onto him. ,13900
VARIOUS SHOTS of the increasingly brutal match, ending with: Dave rides Mark, who's on his stomach, flattened and splayed - grappling for a hold. ,2900
Mark glances up to SEE: The USA Wrestling men WATCHING from near the door. ,461000
Mark looks away, gritting his teeth, but Dave's gotten his hold. ,156000
As Dave TURNS and slams the bigger Mark - CUT TO: INT. DAVE'S CAR/OUTSIDE MARK'S APARTMENT - EVENING Mark looks out the window. ,104000
They sit there, both bruised and bloodied. ,30100
MARK Sorry about your nose. ,959000
DAVE No, you're not. (BEAT) Come by the house, have dinner with me and Nance and the kids. ,452000
Mark's still looking out the window. ,1910000
He speaks quietly - MARK You win a gold medal for them. ,55000
And still. ,13600000
No respect. ,786000
He reaches for the door handle. ,1290000
DAVE Hey. ,17300
Gimme a hug. ,6940000
Dave reaches for his arm, and Mark folds automatically into his older brother, puts his head on his chest. ,26300
Dave embraces him for several long moments - it's like a father and his young child. ,2770000
Then Dave smacks him on the back of the neck. ,13000000
DAVE (CONT'D) Same time tomorrow. 12. ,314000
Mark nods, gets out of the car and walks away. ,1560000
CUT TO: INT. MARK'S APARTMENT - EVENING Mark presses PLAY on his answering machine. ,28500
Hang-ups and DIAL TONES. CUT TO: INT. MARK'S APARTMENT/BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER Mark examines his bruised face in the mirror, wiping away blood - some of it his, some his brother's. ,609
CUT TO: INT. MARK'S APARTMENT - LATER Mark's at the refrigerator, cracking ice cube trays into a plastic 7-11 shopping bag. ,83
The PHONE RINGS. He picks up -- MARK (ON PHONE) Yah. ,34200000
A man's voice is heard. ,90200
It sounds like long distance. ,1340000
MAN (OVER PHONE) May I please speak with Mr. Mark Schultz? ,123000
MARK (ON PHONE) It's Mark. ,56700000
MAN (OVER PHONE) I'm sorry to call you at night, but Mr. du Pont was anxious that I get in touch with you. ,53700
MARK (ON PHONE) Okay... ,60200000
MAN (ON PHONE) He asked that you please consider taking a day off from your training to come out to Foxcatcher Farms so you men can meet face to face. ,32900
MARK (ON PHONE) Who do you work for again? 13. ,15900000
MAN (ON PHONE) John E. du Pont of the du Pont family of Newtown Square, Pennsylvania. (BEAT) You may also know of him in connection with his support of the Villanova wrestling program. ,17400
MARK (ON PHONE) (HE DOESN'T) What does he want to talk about? ,4850000
MAN (ON PHONE) Mr. du Pont requested that I contact you to set up a meeting. ,500000
He'd like to bring you out to Pennsylvania. ,657000
MARK (ON PHONE) Uh-huh. ,259000
MAN (ON PHONE) If I may I'd like to make travel arrangements for you, Mr. Schultz. ,625000
Mark's holding the ice cube tray, alone in his dingy kitchen. ,12600
MAN (ON PHONE) (CONT'D) Mr. Schultz? ,231000
CUT TO: INT. PHL AIRPORT/ARRIVAL GATE - DAY BRANDON (20s, post-prep school, jacket/tie) waits for Mark. ,12400
BRANDON Mr. Schultz, I'm Brandon. ,313000
Welcome to Philadelphia. ,8880000
CUT TO: INT. HELICOPTER (AIRBORNE) - DAY Mark watches out the clear Plexi as the Pennsylvania countryside spreads out below him. ,10500
He and Brandon and the pilot (LARRY - 50s, aviator glasses, Air Cavalry patch on his jacket) all wear RADIO MIC HEADSETS. 14. ,6460
BRANDON (ON RADIO MIC) Mr. du Pont would have flown you himself, but he was asked at the last minute for tactical assistance by the Newtown Square Police Department. ,8770
Mark has no idea what that means, but nods his head. ,20200000
BRANDON (ON RADIO MIC) (CONT'D) He should be back at the estate by the time we get there. ,56800
Larry BANKS the plane steeply on Mark's side so Mark has an unobstructed view of the ground. ,166000
LARRY (ON RADIO MIC) Valley Forge below you. ,314000
They speed over the historic site - wide fields, the memorial arch, wood fences, the old stone house. ,221000
BRANDON (ON RADIO MIC) The du Pont family's supplied American armed forces with gunpowder since the beginning. (as Larry heads south) Foxcatcher in three minutes. ,33
CUT TO: I/E. ,28400000
HELICOPTER (AIRBORNE)/FOXCATCHER ESTATE - MINUTES LATER A MARE and FOAL run away as the helicopter descends toward the Big House - a huge Georgian brick home in the middle of 800 acres of fields and woods and outbuildings. ,21
CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY/BIG HOUSE - DAY Brandon leads Mark down a carpeted hallway. ,5750
CUT TO: INT. LIBRARY/BIG HOUSE - DAY They enter. ,165000
It's at once grandly elegant and musty. 15. ,13400
BRANDON Feel free to look around the library. ,38300000
Mr. du Pont will be up shortly. ,293000
Shuts the door behind him. ,1260000
Mark's never been in a room like this - oil paintings of du Pont ancestors; foxhounds, horses, hunts. ,41000
Leather-bound books share space with framed OLD STAMPS and antique (and not so antique) PISTOLS. Framed PHOTOS of the same man (JOHN DU PONT - 50, thin, beak-nosed, blond-grey hair) with Presidents Ford, Nixon, Reagan... ,5
Henry Kissinger. ,571000
Mark's standing, gazing at the photos, when the door opens, revealing JOHN DU PONT, a police-issue HOLSTER dangling from one hand. ,3470
He stops and breathlessly regards Mark. ,12600
DU PONT You're actually here. ,96400000
MARK Oh. Yes, sir. ,171000
DU PONT In my study. ,84000000
MARK (no idea what to say) They said it was the library. ,5330000
DU PONT It is. ,416000
Du Pont puts the holster onto a chair. ,1950
Holds out his hand. ,6860000
DU PONT (CONT'D) John du Pont. ,420000
MARK Mark Sch -- DU PONT - I know who you are - I've watched your Olympic victory enough times to know exactly who you are, every inch of you. ,19300
Please, put your bag down, make yourself comfortable, sit, make yourself at home - (You quickly realize that du Pont can be voluble and charming, but the more time you spend with him, the more you see what an effort this is for him - how essentially uncomfortable he is in his own skin.... ,58
Also, he just might have snorted a tiny bit of coke before he came in.) 16. ,23700
Mark sits. ,13100
Du Pont settles in, sits facing him - focused entirely on Mark. ,12000
He speaks intimately, sincerely DU PONT (CONT'D) I watched the video of your Olympic run again last night. ,2910
After you broke the arm of the Turk - after they disqualified you, handed you a loss - after they put an extra official on you to watch your holds - all of which were legal - after all that you rack up seven straight wins to take the medal. ,23500
For your country. ,99400000
Thrilling. ,
Thrilling. ,
Inspiring. ,
Take the gold medal. ,
Mark can't recall when he's received this kind of attention. ,
MARK Thank you, sir. ,
I'm proud of that day. ,
DU PONT You should be. ,
I'm proud of that day. ,
I'm proud of you on that day. ,
Your parents must be enormously proud. ,
MARK (after a moment) To be perfectly honest, we don't often talk. ,
Du Pont nods, hoping Mark might say more. ,
When he doesn't - DU PONT I want to tell you how much I appreciate your coming here. ,
I know it cuts into your training. ,
I imagine that's every day for you? ,
MARK Yes sir, it is. ,
DU PONT Strength training in the morning? ,
Upper body regimen - muscle tone - building up the muscle tone - across the upper body. ,
In the morning? 17. ,
MARK Oh. Well. ,
I take the mornings on my own - as you said, strength training, endurance - then I meet up with my brother - you know Dave Schultz - ? ,
DU PONT Of course, of course, yes, I know him. ,
I mean, not personally, but yes, of course, I do know him. ,
MARK - I meet up with him at the U-W gym, we work out whatever free time we can grab between team practice. ,
DU PONT University of Wisconsin. ,
MARK Yes sir. ,
DU PONT Where you both coach. ,
Mark NODS vaguely. ,
DU PONT (CONT'D) And they provide you with everything you need? ,
MARK Pretty much. ,
A moment as du Pont watches Mark. ,
DU PONT I'd like to see you win this upcoming tournament - MARK - Thank you - DU PONT - I'd like to help you win this upcoming tournament. ,
It's a big one, yes? ,
MARK It's the world championship. 18. ,
Du Pont nods. ,
DU PONT Why do you do it, Mark? ,
Mark just looks at him, unsure what he's being asked. ,
DU PONT (CONT'D) Why? ,
MARK (simply no other reason) I want to be the best in the world. ,
DU PONT I want you to be the best in the world. ,
I want this country to be the best in the world. (THEN) May I speak frankly? ,
Mark nods... of course. ,
DU PONT (CONT'D) I'm concerned. ,
I'm concerned by what I see in these Unites States. ,
Athletes labor to bring honor to America, and America fails to honor that labor. ,
Fails to honor it and fails to support it. ,
Mark's staring at du Pont intently. ,
DU PONT (CONT'D) When did you win your first match? ,
MARK I started kind of late - high school sophomore. ,
Du Pont waits, listening... ,
MARK (CONT'D) I was... well, truthfully, I was... kind of lost. ,
And I got into it `cause my brother was wrestling. ,
He convinced me to give it a try. ,
I never told him this, but I was scared of losing in front of him. ,
So of course my first match I get put up against a kid two years older. ,
Dave was helping coach from my corner... and at the end, when the ref raised my hand... (MORE) 19. ,
MARK (CONT'D) there was my brother, he was running towards me - screaming - laughing - he lifted me up -- Mark stops - face flushed - tries to stop himself from getting CHOKED UP. After a few moments, he speaks quietly: MARK (CONT'D) It's always been his sport. ,
He let me inside. ,
I'm just lucky to be very very good at it. ,
DU PONT You won that match. ,
Not him. ,
CUT TO: EXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE - DAY Du Pont and Mark walk the last few steps of a huge lawn up to an OLD FIELD HOUSE in the final stages of renovation. ,
Du Pont opens the door. ,
They walk into a gleaming new GYM. CUT TO: INT. FOXCATCHER GYM - CONTINUOUS Four pristine WRESTLING MATS are spread out on the floor. ,
Through a doorway on the far end we can glimpse a WEIGHT ROOM with new nautilus and stationary bikes and free weights. ,
DU PONT The U.S. ,
Olympic Committee refuses to recognize that training for international competition is a full time job. ,
Why is that? ,
Why is that? (looks at Mark) I want you all to have a home. ,
CUT TO: EXT. VALLEY FORGE - LATE AFTERNOON VARIOUS SHOTS of the vast historic site - monuments and fences and stone house headquarters. ,
DU PONT (V.O.) I wish every American could come here and see for themselves. ,
See the price of freedom. ,
It's not free at all. 20. ,
Mark stands next to John on a ridge over the CEMETERY field. ,
Du Pont's front leg is poised on a large rock, as if he's a General surveying all that has been conquered. ,
His black Ford Mercury is parked nearby. ,
DU PONT The sacrifices of the troops that first long winter remind me of what you athletes go through. ,
Silence as they look out over the national park. ,
DU PONT (CONT'D) I'm gratified my family could play a small part in the history here. ,
Then du Pont speaks, as much to Mark as to himself - DU PONT (CONT'D) We can't choose the family we're born to. ,
But we can make our own. (BEAT) I can't think of anyone I'd rather build a team with. (turns to Mark) You name your price. ,
CUT TO: EXT. PHL AIRPORT - ESTABLISHING/DAY A plane takes off on the runway. ,
CUT TO: INT. PHL AIRPORT/BATHROOM - DAY CLOSE UP on Mark's face, looking at himself in the mirror. ,
Studying his own face. ,
Then he erupts in a PRIMAL SCREAM. CUT TO: EXT. PINE TREE - DAY CLOSE UP on the face of a SIX-YEAR OLD BOY, CRYING - terrified. ,
ALEXANDER, Dave's son. ,
He's mid-way up a tall pine tree and scared to go any higher. ,
Dave is a couple of branches above him. ,
He looks down at Alexander, patiently waiting for the boy to stop crying. ,
Finally, ALEX stops. 21. ,
DAVE You ready? ,
The boy nods. ,
They climb higher. ,
CUT TO: I/E. ,
TAXI/MADISON/DAVE'S STREET - DAY Mark rides in the back of a cab. ,
As he nears Dave's house, we SEE Nancy tapping a beer keg in the side yard. ,
Dave and Alex sit in the TOP OF THE TREE, watching Mark arrive. ,
CUT TO: EXT. DAVE'S HOUSE - LATER/DAY Lots of U of W wrestlers, coaches, wives, girlfriends, kids. ,
Dave's at the BBQ, carving a huge roast on a spit with a long CARVING KNIFE. Mark's talking to him - MARK 25 thousand a year. ,
He said name your price and I said the highest price that came into my head. ,
We'd get to hand-pick our own team, wrestlers we want to work with - DAVE Who you gonna train with? ,
MARK No - I mean... when I say we, I mean - you and me... could choose a team. ,
Together. ,
DAVE What does du Pont get out of it? ,
MARK As soon as you meet him you'll understand. ,
He sees what we're after. ,
He cares about America - old family, basically paid for the Revolutionary War - he gets it. ,
He wants to help us win, help restore our pride. ,
DAVE My pride is fine. 22. ,
MARK No, not.... ,
This country's pride. ,
Dave just looks at him, silent. ,
MARK (CONT'D) Dave - this is it. ,
This is what we've wanted our whole lives - just to train - you and me - not to have to deal with USA Wrestling, or Harper and his corrupt university program - not to have to think about anybody else... ,
Nancy has wandered over, Danielle on her hip. ,
NANCY - What're you guys talking about? ,
MARK I'm speaking to my brother, that okay with you? ,
Nancy and Dave share a glance. ,
Then Nancy turns to walk away. ,
NANCY Always good to see you, Mark. (as she walks away) Please, eat our food, shit on our lawn. ,
Enjoy yourself... ,
The brothers are silent for a long moment until she's gone. ,
MARK Why does she... ,
He trails off. ,
Then, a bit desperate - MARK (CONT'D) The deer hunting on his farm's supposed to be amazing... ,
Dave speaks gently. ,
DAVE I got a good thing going here. ,
I got a contract. ,
Nancy's happy, Alex likes his school... ,
The reality starts to hit Mark that he may be doing this alone, without his older brother. ,
He's shell-shocked. ,
MARK The Worlds are sixty days away. 23. ,
DAVE Tell me your plan. ,
Who you gonna train with? ,
MARK (LOST) Du Pont's taking his money out of the Villanova program. ,
They'll pull the plug on that. ,
So. Dan Bane could come. ,
I - I guess Dan Bane. (beat, then, very quietly) I don't know how to do this without you. ,
DAVE Do what? ,
The answer is "everything" -- but Mark just shakes his head. ,
DAVE (CONT'D) It sounds like an opportunity. ,
MARK Does it? ,
DAVE I think you could make something of it. ,
MARK Do you? (DAVE NODS) A spot's always open for you if you decide to come. ,
DAVE Thank you. ,
Dave steps forward and holds out his arms - DAVE (CONT'D) Congrats, little brother. ,
Mark steps into his brother's arms, folding into him, head on his chest, holding on for dear life. ,
Nancy looks over. ,
CUT TO: 24. ,
I/E. ,
MARK'S APARTMENT - MORNING Mark packs his apartment - trashing just about everything, tossing it in the dumpster - stuffing the few essentials in his AMC GREMLIN. CUT TO: EXT. DRIVING - DAY Mark drives across Ohio. ,

The attendant - clearly a HIGH SCHOOL WRESTLER - shakes his hand. ,
CUT TO: EXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE - DAY Mark pulls onto the estate grounds. ,
CUT TO: EXT. FRONT DOOR/BIG HOUSE - DAY Mark rings the doorbell. ,
He goes to ring it again and the door is opened by a UNIFORMED MAID. MARK Hi. I'm Mark Schultz. ,
That means nothing to her. ,
MARK (CONT'D) I'm here to see John du Pont? ,
UNIFORMED MAID Is Mr. du Pont expecting you? ,
MARK Yeah. ,
Well - not today exactly, but, yes. ,
This week. ,
Sometime. ,
UNIFORMED MAID Just a moment, please. 25. ,
MARK In the meantime can I use the - She SHUTS the door, leaving him outside. ,
He turns and looks out over the VAST LAWN of the estate. ,
Far off, it's being mowed by a gardener. ,
UNIFORMED MAID (opening the door) Please. ,
CUT TO: INT. BIG HOUSE/FOXCATCHER - CONTINUOUS They walk just a few feet and she gestures toward a door. ,
MARK (CONFUSED) Is he? ,
He's in there? ,
UNIFORMED MAID The washroom. ,
CUT TO: INT. ROCOCO WASHROOM/BIG HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER Floral wallpaper, gold fixtures and faucet. ,
Mark pisses - mouth open, eyes half shut. ,
He flushes. ,
He looks at a dish holding little pastel horseshoes. ,
Soap? ,
He picks one up, smells it. ,
Washes his hands - monstrous with the tiny soap. ,
He wipes his hands on his pants, avoiding the neatly hung towelettes. ,
He opens the door. ,
UNIFORMED MAID Mr. Beck will see you now. ,
Mark doesn't know who Mr. Beck is. ,
CUT TO: INT. STAN BECK'S OFFICE/BIG HOUSE - MINUTES LATER Mark is let into a large third floor office with a big desk, wood filing cabinets, LAW BOOKS lining the bookshelves. ,
STAN BECK (mid-forties, no-nonsense, suit and tie) rises from behind the desk as Mark enters. 26. ,
STAN BECK Come in, sit down. ,
MARK Thanks. ,
STAN BECK Thank you, Rosie. ,
UNIFORMED MAID You're welcome, Mr. Beck. ,
She exits, closing the door behind her. ,
STAN BECK Okay. ,
So. Mark Schultz, correct? ,
MARK Yes. ,
STAN BECK (opens a folder, writing) S-C-H-U-L-T-Z? ,
MARK That's right. ,
STAN BECK ... ,
M-A-R-K? ,
Mark just looks at him. ,
Then he nods. ,
STAN BECK (CONT'D) All right. ,
Mark. ,
I manage affairs for Mr. du Pont. ,
Look after his interests. ,
If you have a problem, you come to me. ,
If Mr. Du Pont has a problem, I'll come to you. ,
Okay? ,
MARK Sounds okay. ,
STAN BECK Let's talk about what you're doing here. ,
I'd like to make sure we all understand each other. ,
Does that sound like a good policy to you? ,
MARK That could be a good policy. 27. ,
STAN BECK Good. ,
I think so, too. ,
First thing I can tell you is that Mr. du Pont is very happy he can help you with your goals. ,
But I want to make sure you're aware of what's expected. ,
It's not a free ride. ,
In exchange for the guest house, the more than substantial salary, the privilege of training at Foxcatcher Farms, Mr. du Pont expects results. ,
MARK Yes. ,
STAN BECK I'm sure you can appreciate that. ,
MARK Of course. ,
STAN BECK That goes for every wrestler. ,
MARK I've actually got suggestions for about half the roster. ,
He pulls a creased, folded piece of paper from his pocket. ,
STAN BECK What about the other half? ,
MARK (BEAT) I've been making phone calls. ,
STAN BECK I'll take a look at that when you've finished. ,
Stan takes out a form, writes on it as Mark puts away list. ,
STAN BECK (CONT'D) Your age? ,
MARK Twenty-seven. ,
STAN BECK Education? 28. ,
MARK Oklahoma University. ,
STAN BECK Undergraduate? ,
MARK Yes. ,
STAN BECK You graduated? ,
MARK Yes. ,
STAN BECK Do you own any property? ,
MARK No. STAN BECK Are your parents still married? ,
MARK (BEAT) No. STAN BECK How old were you when they separated? ,
MARK Two. ,
STAN BECK Have you ever been accused of a crime? ,
MARK No. The DOOR OPENS and John du Pont pokes his head in. ,
Mark STANDS, relieved to see him finally -- MARK (CONT'D) Mr. du Pont. ,
Du Pont seems surprised to see Mark. ,
He stays in the doorway, waves slightly. ,
DU PONT Ah. Hello. ,
You've arrived. 29. ,
MARK Yes sir, I drove straight down. ,
It's a little odd that du Pont doesn't enter - he seems nervous. ,
He looks at Stan. ,
Stan hands him a sheet of paper. ,
STAN Tonight's speech. ,
All set. ,
John takes the paper and glances at it. ,
Then - DU PONT They're setting him up in the chalet? ,
STAN BECK Yes, sir. ,
DU PONT Excellent bed. ,
Firm mattress. (SILENCE) Good for the lower back. ,
MARK Great. ,
DU PONT All right. ,
MARK All right. ,
Thank you, sir. ,
And du Pont's gone, closing the door behind him. ,
STAN BECK Shall we finish this? ,
Mark sits. ,
STAN BECK (CONT'D) Have you ever been sued? ,108000
MARK No. STAN BECK Have you ever initiated a lawsuit? ,97
CUT TO: 30. ,9480000
EXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE - AFTERNOON Brandon walks with Mark. ,43600
They've come far, across the huge side yard - the Big House looks small behind them. ,533000
Mark can see HORSE STABLES that let out onto a huge fenced track with a grass infield. ,32500
Stable hands are putting several thoroughbred horses through their paces. ,9450
BRANDON (re the horses) They're Mrs. du Pont's. ,150000
We all just keep our distance. ,18000000
They enter the WOODS. Just inside the trees is THE CHALET - a European style wooden guest house that is now Mark's home. ,25
MARK I didn't realize he was married. ,20500000
BRANDON Mr. du Pont? ,290000
He's not. ,15700000
Mrs. du Pont's his mother. ,148000
CUT TO: INT. THE CHALET - AFTERNOON Brandon lets Mark in the door, turns on the lights in the living room, in the kitchen, goes to the bedroom. ,83300
It's decorated like a ski chalet. ,658000
Brandon walks back from the bedroom, holding KEYS out to Mark- BRANDON Utilities are paid for - gas, electric. ,108000
Refrigerator's stocked for now, but in the future you're responsible for feeding yourself. ,17200
Unless of course you get invited to the Big House for dinner. ,1600000
Mark, still standing in the entry-way, accepts the keys. ,142000
BRANDON (CONT'D) Someone will bring your car around. ,295000
Anything else you need? ,2500000
MARK Has he always lived with his mother? ,16500000
BRANDON Mr. du Pont? ,249000
I think so. 31. ,20600000
Brandon leaves. ,4900
Mark stands still for a long time, gazing at his new home - including some of the oddities, like the POLAR BEAR SKIN RUG (with HEAD ON) which is draped over the sofa. ,3910
CUT TO: INT. THE CHALET - LATE THAT NIGHT Mark (in tank-top undershirt) tapes up PHOTOS of himself and Dave. ,404000
The POLAR BEAR HEAD on the rug gazes blankly at him. ,11200
A KNOCK on the living room window. ,2000000
It's John du Pont, who points toward the front door. ,99300
EXT. PORCH/THE CHALET - CONTINUOUS/LATE NIGHT Mark opens the door. ,40100
John's standing on the little porch, wearing a tux, holding a BOOK and a SMALL BOX. MARK Mr. du Pont, I want to thank you FOR - Du Pont holds up a finger. ,13600
Mark STOPS. Du Pont whispers - DU PONT You hear that? ,35100
Mark listens, shakes his head. ,600000
Du Pont holds up his finger again - and then we HEAR it: a faint HOOTING from the woods. ,2260
DU PONT (CONT'D) Barred owl - He hands Mark the small box he's holding. ,74600
Inside is a very small set of BINOCULARS. DU PONT (CONT'D) When you spot one, you'll see with each hoot there's a white flash in his collar. ,1900
His throat swells, and he reveals to you the lighter feathers he keeps hidden underneath. ,50000
He hands Mark the BOOK: "South Pacific Birds" by John Eleuthere du Pont. ,257000
DU PONT (CONT'D) It's from ten years ago, but I thought you might find it interesting. 32. ,6340
MARK You wrote this? ,6
DU PONT I did. ,17200000
Mark seems genuinely touched and impressed. ,10
MARK Thank you. ,28800000
Do you want to come in? ,54000000
DU PONT No no - MARK - The fridge is full - you probably know better than me what's in there- DU PONT - No. You need your rest. ,1530
You need to get started bright and early. ,79700000
Du Pont hold up his own set of binoculars. ,74800
DU PONT (CONT'D) - I had a wonderful night a few years back when I spotted all eight Northeast species. ,1030
Right here on the farm. (THEN) What do we have - two months to the Worlds? ,278000
MARK Not even. 54 days. ,90600
DU PONT 54 days. (BEAT) We'll get it done. ,39500
On the two men standing in the porch light. ,864000
PRELAP the sound of POUNDING FEET, getting louder and louder - CUT TO: INT. FOXCATCHER GYM - SEVERAL WEEKS LATER/DAY CLOSE ON: Wrestling shoes running FAST in place on the gym mat. ,23000
There are SIX SETS of feet in a wide circle. ,2910000
Team Foxcatcher is beginning to come together. 33. ,4840000
MARK Drop! All six wrestlers, Mark included, drop to the mats for 10 fast push-ups and sit-ups. ,516000
The wrestlers are: ROBERTO GARCIA, aka "GECKO" (21 years old, 105 pounds, Latino, as fast a talker as he is a wrestler); JIM ZEREGA - "JIMMY Z" (24, 114 lbs., blond Midwesterner); MATT POPPER (24, 149 lbs., East coast working class); BRUCE SPRINGER (27, also 149 lbs., half Asian); MARK SCHULTZ (180 lbs.); and DAN BANE (30, 198 lbs., strong and low-key, intelligent, from the West, like Mark.) The wrestlers jump up - run in place incredibly fast. ,73
MARK (CONT'D) DROP - JUMP CUT TO: Garcia and Zerega sprint to the end of the mats and back. ,1260
Relay shuttles, each pair races, then the next pair. ,31900
Popper and Springer have just run (probably for the twentieth time) - they're BENT OVER, sucking wind by the wall. ,15400
Du Pont WALKS IN. He wears a sweatsuit, has a whistle around his neck. ,169000
He hovers a slight distance away, observing, seeming to want to be noticed. ,55300
Mark and Dan take off, racing, as Garcia beats Zerega - Du Pont stares at Garcia. ,16300
As Dan and Mark race back, Dan notices du Pont - DAN Hey, Coach. ,52200
Du Pont becomes at once an odd combination of a kid invited to join in and the actual boss and benefactor of this team. ,3490
DU PONT Dan Bane. ,47300
How's that hamstring? ,4080000
DAN Coming back. ,39200
It's coming back. ,2890000
DU PONT Good. ,13400000
Good to hear. ,12700000
Hamstring coming back. 34. ,108000
MARK (walking up to him) Sir, you need me for something? ,4550000
DU PONT No no. ,17500000
Later. ,25800000
Continue. ,45500000
MARK (nods, turns back) Pair up. ,83400
On the mat. ,11100000
Up and down. ,19600000
Popper, Springer, let's go. ,1350000
Springer's dragging a bit, clearly wiped out. ,42100
GARCIA Spling Loll - must lay off the pohk flied lice. ,3
SPRINGER (EXHAUSTED) Suck me, Gecko. (as he comes onto the mat) And I'm fucking Filipino, dickhead. ,1760
The six wrestlers are paired and spread out on the mats - each pair in the up-down position. ,68700
MARK Go! They all go to it - the top wrestler trying to get a hold secure enough to turn the other - and the down wrestler splayed on the mat, fending him off. ,5760
Du Pont hovers nearby, watching intently. ,1600000
We can sense his fascination - his admiration for these athletes. ,88500
Also, his jealousy - how desperately he'd love to be part of this brotherhood.... ,133000
He CLAPS, like a coach would.... ,64500
DU PONT (awkward, not loud enough) Good. (CLAPS AGAIN) Good. ,104000
CUT TO: EXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE - LATE AFTERNOON Mark, freshly showered, walks across the yard from the field house gym to the Big House. ,37000
CUT TO: 35. ,2300000
INT. DU PONT'S OFFICE/BIG HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON Du Pont's pouring himself a scotch and soda at the built-in wall bar. ,1430
Mark's in the SITTING AREA of this large office, which gives the unmistakable impression of having been inspired by the Oval Office. (We should sense that this is not the first of these meetings.) DU PONT I can't get you anything at all? ,7040
MARK No, thank you. ,231000
DU PONT In training. ,11400000
Excellent. ,17500000
He comes over and sits. ,259
He's immediately hushed and serious. ,3810000
DU PONT (CONT'D) Talk to me about Roberto Garcia. ,26500
MARK Gecko? ,271000
Great wrestler. ,36900
What do you want to know? ,137000000
Du Pont sits there nodding. ,17800
He's mulling something. ,296000
DU PONT Just a sense. ,69600000
Keep your eye on him. ,389000
Let me know of anything suspicious. ,682000
Subversive. ,1100000
Anti. ,19200000
MARK Anti-what? ,1640000
DU PONT Anything at all. ,170000
Phone calls. ,12700000
MARK (no idea what that means) I will. ,30000000
Du Pont stands and goes over to a carved WOODEN EAGLE on top of one of the desk. ,143000
DU PONT You see the artistry, the care, the craftsmanship that went into making this great American symbol? ,15100
You see the face hidden among the feathers? (MARK LOOKS) Right here. 36. ,674000
Mark looks. ,52500
He doesn't see it. ,9170000
But he NODS anyway. ,1210000
DU PONT (CONT'D) We need to exert the same care in crafting a world-class wrestling experience here at Foxcatcher. (MARK NODS) How're we doing with Dave Schultz? ,99
MARK How do you mean? ,120000000
DU PONT You were going to speak to him again. ,179000
When's he coming? ,195000
MARK Right. ,104000
Look. ,23500000
Dave's... he's got a good situation going up in Madison. ,1070000
He's... he doesn't want to uproot. ,126000
The family. ,15200000
Just at the moment. (BEAT) At the present time. ,1900000
DU PONT He is a world class competitor - a world class coach. ,52000
We are building a world class team. ,74100000
He belongs here. ,13100
Tell me what I have to offer him. ,373000
MARK Mr. du Pont, I don't... you can't buy Dave. ,19200000
Du Pont's clearly not happy with this answer. ,2460000
MARK (CONT'D) I wasn't... ,4220000
I didn't realize you wanted him to coach. ,7850000
DU PONT Wrestle and coach. ,3210000
We all coach each other. ,26900
Support each other. ,14000000
His tone suddenly turns bright and positive - DU PONT (CONT'D) Let me ask your opinion - He goes to the desk, where there are several large DRAWINGS of a proposed Foxcatcher logo: a RED FOX running. ,89
In some, the fox runs one way, in some the other. ,32700000
Mark approaches. 37. ,2910000
DU PONT (CONT'D) What do you think? ,255000
Right to left, or left to right? ,53300000
Silence as Mark examines the designs intently. ,1080000
Then, finally - MARK Right to left. ,2740000
Du Pont looks at him, then back at the drawings. ,64700
On the two of them - studying, contemplating... ,6870000
CUT TO: EXT. WOODS/FOXCATCHER - EARLY MORNING Mark RUNS hard through the woods - pushing himself - jumping fallen branches, sprinting up hills. ,4900
He reaches the edge of the woods and stops, bent over, breathing heavily. ,42
Across the field, PRIZE HORSES are led out of the stables onto the grounds of the estate. ,32500
Mark WATCHES. A few wrestlers (Zerega, Popper and Dan Bane) emerge from the woods behind Mark, running. ,55800
Dan Bane leaves the other two. ,39700
DAN I'll catch up with you all later. ,273000
Zerega and Popper jog off. ,33800
Dan comes to stand next to Mark, who has taken his little pair of BINOCULARS from the pocket of his sweats and is looking through them. ,88000
After a moment, he hands Dan the binoculars. ,60800
Dan looks through them. ,44000
MARK I'm pretty sure that's John's mother. ,1180000
BINOCULARS POV: A VERY OLD WOMAN stands in front of her wheelchair, with the help of an attendant. ,9290
When the horses reach her, she TOUCHES THEM LOVINGLY, tenderly stroking their faces, feeding them treats from her hands. ,7090
She's completely at home with these animals, as they are with her. ,2640000
CUT TO: INT. WRESTLING ARENA/CLERMONT-FERRAND, FRANCE - DAY Dave Schultz SLAMS his opponent to the mat. ,1480
He's in TEAM USA uniform, and he's dominating. 38. ,1920000
Du Pont watches from the stands, transfixed. ,7420
Then he glances over at: Mark. ,163000
Off to the side, watching his brother wrestle. ,3400000
Whether he's fascinated, jealous, rooting - we can't tell. ,106000
CUT TO: INT. WRESTLING ARENA/CLERMONT-FERRAND - LATER/DAY Mark wrestles like an animal - aggressive, forceful and fast. ,2050
Dave's in Mark's corner, coaching - focused, intense, and very tough on Mark - shouting instruction. ,16200
On du Pont, watching from the stands... ,20700
CUT TO: INT. DAVE'S HOTEL ROOM - EVENING Loud. ,221000
The TV is on. ,29300000
A few Team USA WRESTLERS watch the French Sports TV wrap-up of the day's matches. ,135000
Danielle JUMPS on the bed near the window, with Nancy watching her. ,
DANIELLE One... twois... quatro! Nancy laughs. ,41400
Dave wrestles with Alexander on the other bed. ,529000
CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE DAVE'S ROOM - SAME TIME Du Pont and Mark are outside the door. ,54900
Mark holds a VIDEOTAPE. He KNOCKS. No answer. ,160000
CUT TO: INT. DAVE'S HOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME Dave wrestling with Alex on the bed. ,281000
DAVE ...Fireman's carry... to a half- nelson... to a chicken wing... ,42200
Wait! A chicken wing? ,1720000
He starts to gobble up Alex's arm, who SHRIEKS in delight. ,671000
CUT TO: 39. ,96
INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE DAVE'S ROOM - SAME TIME Mark knocks again. ,116000
We HEAR Nancy's voice yell from inside: "It's open!" Mark opens the door. ,4160000
INT. DAVE'S HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS Noisy, chaotic. ,15400
The wrestlers glance over "Hey, Mark" "What's up".... ,505000
Mark's focused on Dave, who wrestles with Alex - MARK Dave. ,1060000
DAVE - a scrambled-egg!... a feather- pluck!... ,1400
Dave's plucking Alex and Alex is cracking up. ,58500
MARK Dave. ,46900
DAVE Hey, Mark -- MARK Come meet Mr. du Pont. ,267000
Dave sweeps up Alex and throws him over his shoulder, carrying him to the door. ,143000
He SHAKES du Pont's HAND. DAVE Hi. Dave Schultz. ,36700
DU PONT John du Pont. ,361000
It's a pleasure to meet you in person finally. ,7730000
MARK (TO DAVE) I told him how excited you were to meet him. ,2370000
DAVE This is Alex, that's my wife, Nancy, our daughter Danielle. (TO NANCY) Hey, Nance. ,230000
John du Pont. ,17600000
Nancy waves from over near the window - NANCY Hey. 40. ,43300
DU PONT Hello. ,16800000
DAVE Come on in. ,148000
Can I get you a drink - DU PONT No no. ,350000
DAVE You sure - ? ,29000000
DU PONT Thank you. ,87900000
No. I need to be getting back. ,53700000
But, don't worry - we'll make a Foxcatcher out of you yet. (he laughs awkwardly) Until tomorrow. ,5040
And he's GONE. Beat. ,30100
Dave shrugs. ,1910
DAVE Well, I know what I need. ,31200000
MARK What? ,345000
DAVE Turkey drumstick! He throws Alex on the bed and jumps on him. ,95100
Alex SQUEALS. Mark heads for the TV across the room. ,346000
Pops in his video. ,6000000
MARK Dave, check out the tape I have on NANEV - DAVE (STILL WRESTLING) YEAH - MARK I want to show you this downblock - DAVE Cue it up. ,39800
As the tape cues up, Mark glances at Nancy. ,650000
MARK Too difficult to come say hello to Mr. du Pont? 41. ,22600
NANCY I said hello. (lights a CIGARETTE) I'm watching my kid. ,413000
MARK It's John du Pont. ,1190000
One of the most generous men in America. ,2180000
He's gonna save USA Wrestling. (re. cigarette) Can you not do that in here? ,656000
NANCY Do what? ,39700000
MARK Smoking. ,3000
NANCY Smoke? ,1520
MARK I wrestle tomorrow. ,928000
NANCY It's my room, Mark. ,17300000
You don't have to be here. ,689000
MARK I'm trying to get advice from my brother, get ready for the finals - NANCY Go get ready - MARK You start smoking - ? ,122000
NANCY You can leave. ,54000000
Go to your own room - MARK - Your kids are in here - She BLOWS SMOKE at him. ,4480000
MARK (CONT'D) What the hell is that? ,138000
DAVE Mark. ,42300
Calm down. ,2910000
MARK I'm not the one frigging smoking. 42. ,50900000
DAVE The window's open. ,5210000
Relax. ,15700000
Show me what you want me to look at. ,59700000
Mark looks around the room. ,56400000
At Alexander giggling on the bed, at Danielle bouncing, Nancy BLOWING SMOKE RINGS. It's all too much. ,35100
He pulls out the videotape and WALKS OUT the door. ,464000
CUT TO: INT. ARENA/CLERMONT-FERRAND - DAY VARIOUS SHOTS: Final matches in progress, intense and brutal. ,692
CUT TO: INT. LOCKER ROOM - SAME TIME Mark sits, alone, head in his hands. ,165000
CUT TO: INT. ARENA/CLERMONT-FERRAND - SAME TIME Faces in the crowd watching; strained faces of the wrestlers. ,22500
Mark Schultz and Alexander Nanev's names are put up on the board. ,320000
FINALS à 82 KILOS... ,474000
CUT TO: INT. LOCKER ROOM - SAME TIME Du Pont enters. ,52700
Mark's alone on a corner bench, frozen, head in his hands. ,114000
Du Pont is stiff, but gentle. ,46000
DU PONT I think you're up. ,80000000
Du Pont goes over to him, unsure what to do. ,133000
Uncomfortable, he puts his hand on Mark's shoulder. ,71000
DU PONT (CONT'D) Mark. ,31100
Dave just won. ,1890
It's your turn. ,72400000
Mark's body starts to shake. ,168000
Then, very quietly: MARK I don't want to let you down. 43. ,4110000
This is the first time anyone has said anything like this to du Pont. ,2130000
He has no idea how to respond. ,1740000
He woodenly pats Mark's shoulder, then takes his hand back. ,68400
DU PONT I can't.... ,96100000
I've watched you these past months... (long beat, then quietly) I can't imagine being let down by you. ,1510000
Mark stops shaking. ,5400000
Du Pont stands patiently beside him. ,51000
CUT TO: INT. ARENA/CLERMONT-FERRAND - MOMENTS LATER CAMERA'S TIGHT ON Mark as he enters the arena. ,1630
Mark walks directly onto the mat, straight to the center, faces off with the Bulgarian, NANEV. CAMERA stays tight on Mark looking directly at Nanev, as the ref checks each of them. ,8600
WHISTLE. The match begins. ,1430000
Intense and rough. ,7980000
Neither able to gain an edge. ,3210000
Dave coaches from Mark's corner. ,52500000
CUT TO: In between periods. ,2610000
Mark sits as Dave FANS him with a towel, shouting instruction. ,12800
Mark glances behind him: du Pont watches from the stands. ,18800
CUT TO: Mark and Nanev wrestle the final seconds - Mark ahead by a point. ,35300
Nanev tries desperately to turn Mark, to gain any advantage. ,24300
The whistle blows. ,238000
The ref takes each of their hands. ,23500000
He RAISES Mark's. ,
He turns them around, raises Mark's hand again. ,15800000
Mark does a BACK FLIP. He trots over to the opposing coach, shakes his hand. ,21600
He trots to his corner where Dave - beaming, his arms open wide - embraces him. ,11300
Mark hugs his brother quickly, then turns to LOOK OUT into the stands. ,148000
He SPOTS du Pont, who's coming down the steps toward the platform. ,87300
Mark walks toward him. ,3850000
The enormity of what he's just accomplished STARTS TO HIT Mark. ,191000
His face is red. ,140000
He reaches du Pont, and from a step below him, THROWS HIS ARMS around him, clings to him. ,9080
Mark starts to SOB. Du Pont holds him as he looks out toward the wrestling mat, where Dave watches. 44. ,10100
PRELAP SOUND: The beginning "AAAAAH's" of David Bowie's "LET'S DANCE". CUT TO: INT. TROPHY ROOM/BIG HOUSE - NIGHT "LET'S DANCE" blasts from the stereo. ,8770
Team Foxcatcher wrestlers are huddled in a circle in the Trophy Room - shouting the "AAAAAAAH's" along with the thin white duke. ,12
Each holds a BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE, shaking it up as they sing. ,290000
When the chords kick in, they POP THEIR CORKS - SPRAYING champagne on each other, shouting wildly. ,12300
Then they all CHUG the rest of their bottles. ,119000
Du Pont is dancing around outside the circle, doing his best Euro-electronica moves, and drinking from his bottle (and it's not his first). ,1310
The wrestlers DANCE. When du Pont finishes his bottle - DU PONT Let's clear it out! He gestures toward the center section of the enormous TROPHY CASE - the entirety of which is filled with horse-jumping and fox-hunting medals, ribbons and plaques. ,41
Some of the wrestlers open the glass doors and start taking down what's in there. ,4530000
A few of the others open more liquor... ,18300000
DU PONT (CONT'D) Oh, yes! SPRINGER You sure about this? ,261000
DU PONT Mother's idea of sport is riding a horse that's chasing a dog that's chasing a fox. ,65900
I don't share her affection for horseflesh - The center case is cleared out. ,117000
DU PONT (CONT'D) Put `em up, boys! They hang their wrestling medals, place in trophies and other awards - leaving the TOP FEW HOOKS EMPTY. WRESTLERS (CHANTING TOGETHER) Mark! Mark! Mark! Mark!... 45. ,9
Mark hangs his OLYMPIC and WORLD CUP GOLDS on the top hooks. ,26100
WRESTLERS (CONT'D) U.S.A! U.S.A! U.S.A!... ,48100
Du Pont raises his bottle to Mark - DU PONT You've brought honor to Team Foxcatcher. ,964
He starts to walk toward him. ,377000
DU PONT (CONT'D) You've brought honor to - He SLIPS on the wet floor and his feet fly up in front of him, landing him FLAT ON HIS BACK. SILENCE. Du Pont's lying there, shaking - is he crying? ,1120
No one knows what exactly to do. ,401000
Dan Bane approaches him. ,6370
DAN You all right, Coach? ,428000
Du Pont starts LAUGHING out loud. ,200000
Hugely relieved, Dan holds his hand out to him to help him up. ,27600
Du Pont takes Dan's hand and promptly pulls him to the ground... and... ,312000
JUMPS on his back - WRESTLING with him. ,2630000
The wrestlers, including Mark, go crazy, CHEERING him on. ,78300000
Dan lets du Pont get the best of him... lets du Pont PIN him. ,45100
The wrestlers are cheering madly as du Pont stands with his arms raised. ,24300
He makes as if he's about to do a back flip (like Mark), then sits and does a clumsy backwards somersault. ,10500
Wild cheers. ,20800
DU PONT More drinks! He's on his knees, fists in the air, head thrown back - TOTALLY EXULTANT... ,1750
PRELAP sound of a GUNSHOT - CUT TO: EXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE - NEXT MORNING VARIOUS SHOTS: The AMERICAN FLAG being raised; a hawk soars above the trees; Jean du Pont BRUSHES the horses in the barn. 46. ,6410
CAMERA picks up wrestlers running off their hangovers - Zerega, Popper, Springer, Mark. ,93
They pick up speed as the camera stays with them. ,3290000
WE HEAR more gunshots as they run through the grounds - the SHOTS get louder and louder. ,13900
The wrestlers run somewhat near the FIRING RANGE, where several members of the NEWTOWN POLICE DEPARTMENT, in uniform, are SHOOTING target practice with DU PONT. Du Pont wears a "Team Foxcatcher" zip SWEATJACKET - with his honorary POLICE BADGE pinned to one breast. ,11
On the other breast are sewn the words: "Head Coach", and JOHN "EAGLE" DU PONT. He's about to SHOOT when the wrestlers pass by - WRESTLERS (EXCEPT MARK) Johnny D! Bossman!... ,88
Du Pont, still holding his pistol, turns to watch them run past. ,81100
His expression seems oddly, entirely blank. ,587000
CUT TO: INT. FOXCATCHER GYM/WEIGHT ROOM - DAY A few wrestlers lift weights - the others are hanging out, resting, talking. ,2030
Du Pont wanders in, his target practice PISTOL dangling from the crook of his arm. ,1240
A few guys notice him, greet him CASUALLY, go back to what they were doing. ,135000
Du Pont FIRES a bullet through the roof. ,89600
SILENCE. DU PONT 321 days to Seoul, gentlemen. 321 days. ,86600
Let's get to work. ,10500000
He gestures for Mark to join him. ,255000

CUT TO: INT. DU PONT'S OFFICE - DAY CLOSE ON: a CHECK for $10,000.00 made out to Mark Schultz. ,18700
MARK (O.S.) You don't have to do this. ,89700000
John sits at his desk, pistol stuck in his waistband. ,109000
Mark, sweaty, stands across the desk from him, holding the check. 47. ,590000
DU PONT America doesn't respect you. ,10700000
Doesn't place any value on you at all. ,18300000
I reward accomplishment. ,8950000
MARK Thank you, Coach. ,167000
DU PONT Please. ,13100000
Call me John. ,16800000
Or Coach. ,16200000
Whichever you prefer. ,536000
Maybe Eagle. ,2760
Or Coach. ,16800000
Eagle is good. (THEN) How're we doing with Dave? ,6000000
Mark carefully folds the check, avoiding du Pont's gaze. ,22100
DU PONT (CONT'D) You spoke to him again at the Worlds. ,3770
MARK Yes. ,155000
Yes, I did. ,19200000
I... (BEAT) It's not gonna happen. ,2480000
He got offered a contract extension at Wisconsin, Team USA wants him to train Olympic wrestlers next summer, he - it's not gonna happen. ,91200
John is clearly unhappy with this answer. ,531000
He removes the gun from his waistband, places it on the desk. ,1220000
DU PONT Do you believe in this team? ,38100000
MARK Of course I - DU PONT - Do you believe we deserve this country's best talent? ,1510
MARK I do - DU PONT - I pay for results not only on the mat, but in recruiting the best of the best to Foxcatcher Farms. ,1340
That's part of your job. ,99100000
Mark looks shamed by this. 48. ,
DU PONT (CONT'D) It's probably best. ,112000
Dave intimidates you. ,281000
You don't believe you can ever do better than your brother. ,4330000
Glass ceiling. ,1110000
Impossible for you to break through. ,68400000
It looks like perhaps Mark believes this as well. ,222000
MARK (TENTATIVE) Do you think that's true? ,437000
Because... all these years - Du Pont stands suddenly - DU PONT - Well. ,9010
You're the public face of Foxcatcher. ,9500000
MARK If that's what - DU PONT - What do you know about Masters League wrestling tournaments? ,278000
MARK Uh - well - not all that much - DU PONT - Because I'm thinking of entering one. ,14700
Mark nods - MARK Okay... ,522000

More oil. ,684000
It defines the musculature. ,1710000
Mark walks to his spot in front of the scrim. ,3960000
The two assistants slather baby oil on his arms and chest and legs as the photographer SHOWS him the pose on the monitor. ,5180
PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D) You're winning the gold medal. ,181000
You're raising your arms in triumph. ,1730000
You're also feeling humility. ,1440000

Mark looks over to him. ,7700000
MARK You good with this? ,50600000
DU PONT It's wonderful. ,80700000
It's exactly what I needed from you. ,76900000

PHOTOGRAPHER It's true. ,498
DU PONT Maybe if you kneeled. ,53000
MARK Kneeled now? ,55100
On the floor. (UNSURE) Really? ,6430000
It won't look... ,62200000
DU PONT No. No. You should kneel. ,70900000
Mark kneels in front of du Pont. ,4800

DU PONT (CONT'D) Don't be nervous. ,111000
You'll do great. ,41800000
Mark's not so sure. ,2370000
Then he HEARS a SNIFF. He looks over at du Pont: he's got a COCAINE BULLET in one nostril. ,10300
Du Pont inhales, then OFFERS the bullet to Mark. ,116000
Mark's frozen - DU PONT (CONT'D) What? ,315000
You've never done this? (Mark shakes his head) It helps put everything in perspective. ,779000
Trust me.... ,5540000
Mark. ,23500000
It's just cocaine. ,3000000

STEVE In that case, the Grand Old Party wants to help find you one. ,4150000
Graham calls over to the 3-star GENERAL in full dress uniform who's chewing on a cigar and drinking gin with a Senator. ,4980

Don't send me one without that MK- 19 mounted on top. ,2440000
GENERAL Uh... ,4940
I don't know there, son. ,442000
Civilians don't usually get 40mm blowback grenade launchers. ,11500

Thank you, son. (waves to Jean in AUDIENCE) Hello, Mother. (to them all) The gold medal Mark won in 1984 was tarnished. ,122000
Tarnished by Jimmy Carter. ,2120000
Tarnished by the unpatriotic acts of that democrat administration. ,7530

DU PONT I appreciate this... ,33500

You're ready to rumble, boss. 57. ,2860000
DU PONT No. Mark. ,84200000
I appreciate this. ,8230000
MARK (after a moment) It's nothing. ,15100000
DU PONT When I was fourteen - my father had left us long before that - my best friend was Clifford Holt, our gardener's son. ,13000
Then I found out Mother had been paying Cliff to be friends with me. ,3220000
Mark is moved, but doesn't know what to say. ,2040000
MARK We all have demons. ,81700000
DU PONT (TOTALLY SINCERE) It's good to know you and I have come to this... friendship without any of that nonsense. ,34800
Financial nonsense. ,3300
Neither mentions that du Pont is actually paying Mark. ,3040
Mark struggles whether to admit something. ,130000
Then - MARK When Dave's son, Alex, was born he had some problems with his lungs. ,64200
It looked like he wasn't gonna live. ,1260000
I was sitting in the hospital waiting room, and all I could think was: Maybe it's better if he dies. ,551000
Dave won't be distracted. ,165000
We can get back to training together. (BEAT) Alex is fine now and, you know, he's my nephew. ,811000
I'm not proud I wanted him to die, but it's the truth. ,11000000
That's just the truth. (THEN) You gotta conquer your demons. ,252000
Du Pont stands up. ,4110000
Expressionless, he disappears through the sliding glass doors into the house. ,10000
Mark LOOKS OUT over the dark grounds of Foxcatcher. ,4070000
Quiet. ,15200000
Then Mark jumps out of his skin as a MACHINE GUN FIRES several rounds behind him. 58. ,216000
When he turns around, there's du Pont, a determined look on his face, pointing a semi-automatic MACHINE GUN out into the rolling landscape. ,6240
DU PONT Conquer demons. ,70900
He FIRES again, a short burst of bullets into the dark. ,412000
Du Pont fires again, a sustained volley into the dark... ,17000
MARK (over the gunfire) Yeahhhhh!!!! Du Pont ceases fire and looks out. ,505

DU PONT They're dead. ,78000000
CUT TO: INT. LEAR JET - DAY SILENCE, save for the steady HUM of flight inside the cabin. ,56500

CUT TO: INT. PHOENIX ARENA - DAY Between periods at the "Du Pont Masters Open and Collegiate Invitational". ,27100

Through large OPEN DOORS, in the adjoining gym, a larger crowd cheers on a number of NCAA wrestlers. ,7430
FRED COLE and another USA WRESTLING OFFICIAL look in from the other gym. ,125000
They SEE the posters of Mark on the walls, and they SEE: An exhausted du Pont, in his Foxcatcher singlet, is slumped in his chair, encouraging Mark to massage his shoulders. ,36
Mark OBLIGES. Mark glances at the OPEN DOORS, notices Fred Cole. ,12200
Self-conscious, he ignores Cole and focuses on John. 59. ,16500
MARK When he gives you the slightest opening, you gotta shoot in on him. ,1870000
Be aggressive. ,657000
Show him who's boss. ,22400000
Du Pont nods wearily. ,2230000
He can barely move. ,3580000
CUT TO: The final minute of the match. ,3580000
It's clearly RIGGED. The OTHER WRESTLER is trying to let the exhausted du Pont get the best of him. ,8220
Mark watches. ,14600
The REF blows the end of match whistle. ,5580000
The wrestlers stand, du Pont struggling to his feet. ,12100
The ref takes each of their hands, and raises... du Pont's. ,71700
He's "won". ,7130000
Du Pont limps off the mat. ,19800

Jean just looks at her son, not reacting. ,271000
DU PONT (CONT'D) Including this, Mother. ,377000
Ha. Which I've actually just won. ,27600000
He takes his WINNER'S PLAQUE out of a duffel bag, trying to be casual, but seeming all the more like an eager 9 year-old. ,6270
He holds it out for her. ,449000
She doesn't take it, but leans forward slightly to read what's inscribed on it: "FIRST PLACE, OVER-50, DU PONT MASTER'S INVITATIONAL: JOHN `EAGLE' DU PONT." She sits back. ,1250
JEAN Which ribbons? ,9680000

The gym is EMPTY. CUT TO: INT. GARCIA AND ZEREGA'S BUNGALOW/FOXCATCHER - LATE MORNING Mark and the team are watching a VIDEOTAPE Garcia has gotten of an early ULTIMATE FIGHTING MATCH. It's an American street fighter versus a huge Brazilian Jujutsu expert. ,11
The match is brutal and bloody and the wrestlers watching are CLEARLY INTO IT. Mark is lying on the couch - attentive, but quiet. ,48900
There's KNOCKING at the door, but the guys don't notice it. ,923000
Much LOUDER KNOCKING. Garcia opens the door. ,39000
It's du Pont. ,25400000
Mark RISES to greet him as Dan MUTES the video. ,23100
MARK (COMPLETELY GENUINE) Hi, Boss. ,157000
Any soreness from the match? ,334000
DU PONT I went by the gym - it's almost noon - and there's no one in there. ,118000
There is no one in there. ,143000000
In the gym. ,6140000
MARK Yeah, no, exactly - we've got an intense workout scheduled this afternoon. ,54800
Real intense one. ,1060
So we're taking the morning to rest up. ,385000
DU PONT Who precisely is in charge around here? ,12100

Your brother. ,3340000
When is he coming to Foxcatcher? 62. ,302000
Mark glances at the other guys. ,179000
DU PONT (CONT'D) We need someone to take charge around here, someone to lead. ,47400
MARK John, seriously, I don't know how else to say it. ,30900000
It's not gonna happen. ,314000
You can't buy Dave. ,5020000
It's just not gonna happen. ,858000
Du Pont SLAPS Mark. ,2860000
HARD. Across the face. ,649000
SILENCE. Mark could destroy du Pont. ,146000
He doesn't seem to even consider it. ,31400000
He just stands there, like a chastened schoolboy, his face reddening. ,8790000
Du Pont WALKS OUT past the muted UFC on TV - Once he's gone, no one speaks. ,2640
Then: GARCIA You got bitch-slapped. ,271000
Mark turns to Garcia. ,1430000
GARCIA (CONT'D) Oh shit. ,346000
Garcia runs into the other room. ,6420000
CUT TO: INT. BATHROOM/THE CHALET - DAY Mark stands at the sink STARING at his reflection as the mirror fogs over from the RUNNING SHOWER: bleached hair, one side of his face is red where du Pont slapped him. ,59

Stan Beck comes out of his office, meets him at the top. ,93400
STAN BECK Mark. ,90900
How are things? ,9990000

STAN BECK He's got a very full schedule this afternoon. ,92600000
But I'll let him know you stopped by. ,4210000
MARK (more and more upset) Listen - I - something happened. ,90500
There was a - misunderstanding. ,317000
I think I did something wrong and I really need to talk to him about it- STAN BECK - Mark, I hear you. ,318000
But Mr. du Pont's away for the afternoon on business. ,261000
He's simply not here. ,32900000
Mark doesn't move. ,443000
STAN BECK (CONT'D) You're going to have to do this later. 64. ,301000

He looks at the clock. ,4870000
It's 3 a.m. ,32500000
CUT TO: I/E. ,28200000
FRONT DOOR/THE CHALET - NIGHT Mark opens the door to find du Pont standing there, in his SWEATS. He clearly hasn't been to bed. ,6910
And it's clearly an artificial stimulant that's been keeping him awake. ,112000
DU PONT New moves. ,3790000
Wrestling moves. ,397000
Need to try them out. ,5590000
MARK Oh, uh - DU PONT In the gym. ,88900
Mark forces the cobwebs from his head. ,19900
MARK Yeah, of course. ,38400
Just... just give me a minute. ,34
CUT TO: INT. FOXCATCHER GYM - NIGHT Mark and du Pont are down on the wrestling mat. ,5730
Du Pont on top. ,15100000
He's both weirdly aggressive with Mark - trying to get him in various holds - and also, in the bizarre way he's pressing against Mark, quasi-sexual. ,16200
Mark is BLANK-FACED. Just waiting for it to end. ,6150000
FADE OUT. 65. ,46500

MARK IS ABSENT. Du Pont emerges from the Big House, trailed by Brandon. ,11800
WE SEE du Pont notice what a warm reception Dave gets from the team. ,28300
He comes down the steps, greets Dave and the family. ,78600000
CLOSE ON: Mark, who's at the very far end of the lawn, just inside the ring of trees, WATCHING. His HEAD is COMPLETELY SHAVED. MARK'S POV: Brandon and the team escort Nancy and the kids toward their new home. ,329
Du Pont and Dave ascend the Big House steps together. ,157000
Du Pont puts his arm around Dave's shoulder. ,12500

MARK Hey, Dave. ,13800000
DAVE How you doing? ,5240000
MARK Good. ,223000
DAVE I hadn't seen you yet. ,12300000
I just want to make sure everything's okay. 66. ,44200000
MARK Yeah. ,19200
I'm just concentrating. ,1300000
Trials are in 50 days. ,3690000
DAVE You know, Nancy and the kids are here. ,24900000
MARK How they doing? ,12800000
DAVE Good. ,39700
You should stop in, say hi. ,51900000
MARK I will. (BEAT) I will. ,73700
As the brothers stand in the doorway looking at each other, PRELAP: the sound of a GUNSHOT. CUT TO: EXT. FOXCATCHER WOODS - DAY A deer STAGGERS. It's been hit by a rifle shot. ,12
It stumbles, starts to move away. ,151000
REVERSE onto Dave, holding his RIFLE. He's hunting with Dan Bane and TWO WRESTLERS we don't recognize (recruited by him in the few weeks he's been there.) Dave FIRES again. ,12
HEAR: opening of THE DOOBIE BROTHERS' "Listen to the Music" CUT TO: EXT. BACKYARD/DAVE AND NANCY'S HOUSE/FOXCATCHER - DAY A BOOMBOX plays The Doobie Brothers. ,38
The deer CARCASS hangs from a large tree. ,13400
Dave SKINS it with a long knife. ,106000
Dave's son, Alex, sits on the picnic table, watching. ,22800
Danielle runs around the yard with some of the other wrestlers' kids. ,58500
CUT TO: 67. ,58
EXT. BACKYARD/DAVE AND NANCY'S HOUSE - EVENING MUSIC in the background. ,191000
The (now dozen or so) wrestlers and their families are gathered around the picnic table, the keg, the roasting deer on the SPIT over the fire. ,8350
Du Pont is at the table. ,11000000
Mark stays very much ON THE PERIPHERY of the group. ,428000
Dave's holding court at the table - in front of a huge platter of venison steaks - DAVE There's this big match between an American and a Russian. ,2130
The Russian is a monster, never lost, kills everybody with this hold called The Pretzel. ,23100
So the American coach tells his wrestler, "Listen, whatever you do don't let this guy get you in The Pretzel or you're dead." Sure enough, match starts, the Russian gets him in The Pretzel. ,9180
There are smiles around the table. ,150000
DAVE (CONT'D) The coach buries his head in his hands because he know's it's all over. ,2230000
Suddenly, he hears the crowd roar. ,552000
When he looks up the Russian is flying through the air - he lands on his back, the American jumps him. ,33000
Pins him. ,49700
Boom. ,16100000
The match is over. ,14600000
Du Pont is studying Dave intently, fascinated by the hold he has on people - the attention he gets. ,5310
DAVE (CONT'D) "Nobody's ever gotten out of The Pretzel," the coach says afterward, "How'd you do it?" "Well, Coach, I was just about to give up when I opened my eyes and there was this big hairy pair of balls right in front of my face. ,73
I had nothing to lose, so with my last ounce of strength I craned my neck and bit those babies as hard as I could." (SOME LAUGHS) The coach says, "And that did the trick?" (LOW) (MORE) 68. ,5390
DAVE (CONT'D) "Coach, you'd be surprised how motivated you get when you bite your own balls." Everyone CRACKS UP. Du Pont WATCHES, trying to discern what makes this man so effortlessly magnetic. ,13
Then du Pont laughs loudest of all. ,12500
CUT TO: INT. FOXCATCHER GYM - DAY The dozen wrestlers are spread out on the mats, in pairs, wrestling. ,37500
Dave walks among them. ,183000
He moves close to Springer, giving instruction. ,160000
Du Pont, in sweats and a whistle, lurks nearby. ,12500
Mark's off against the wall, putting on weightlifting gloves. ,211000
DAVE He gives you opportunity, jump on it. ,184000
Hard. ,22500000
Drive him down. ,490000
DU PONT No mercy! Dave looks at du Pont, surprised by the comment - that John's actually behaving as if he's coaching. ,1770
Dave looks at some of the wrestlers, realizes this is the norm. ,11700
He laughs, pats du Pont on the back. ,14400
DAVE (to the wrestlers) Okay. ,3820000
You heard the Head Coach. ,11200000
No mercy. ,2940000
Mark walks out of the wrestling room to the weight room. ,26400000
Du Pont is thrilled to be validated for a moment. ,1790
Then - DAVE (CONT'D) (to du Pont) Would you give us a little room? ,110000
Just stand over there for a sec... (turns to Springer) SPRINGER - Du Pont obeys, SHUFFLES off to the side. ,41
Fluidly, expertly, Dave talks and wrestles through a series of moves with Springer. (MORE) 69. ,6230
DAVE (CONT'D) - when he grabs for your elbow, goes for head position - your hand on his wrist needs to come up immediately, suck his arm to your chest, right hook over the top for the headlock, take him down, drive him down - Du Pont watches the master work for several moments. ,6
DAVE (CONT'D) - you see him commit you make him PAY - Du Pont clearly has nothing to contribute. ,30300
He claps. ,37100
DU PONT Keep it up, gentlemen. ,99400000
Largely ignored, he drifts off into the weight room. ,77300
CUT TO: INT. WEIGHT ROOM/FOXCATCHER GYM - CONTINUOUS Mark sits on the LEG-PRESS, pressing an enormous amount of weight - repeatedly - straining, pushing himself. ,65
Du Pont enters. ,10400000
Mark tries to ignore him, continues to press the huge stack of weights. ,13700
DU PONT Your brother's taking the reins. ,727000
Leading. ,19200000
Mark finishes his set, stares straight ahead, catching his breath. ,14300
DU PONT (CONT'D) You've got more in you than that. ,52400
Mark turns his gaze to du Pont. ,38400
SILENCE. Du Pont walks over behind him, starts massaging Mark's shoulders. ,11500
DU PONT (CONT'D) You've got to dig deep. ,2220
Find out what's inside. ,99600000
Discover what you're made of. ,57000000
MARK (QUIET) Please don't do that. 70. ,4350000
Du Pont keeps massaging. ,22500
Mark glances towards the wrestling room. ,13300
DU PONT Conquer your demons, Mark. ,99700
CONQUER - MARK (QUIET) - Please. ,303000
I'm asking you to not... ,3710000
Dave is coming in the direction of the weight room. ,1130000
Mark STANDS and walks out of the gym. ,585000
Du Pont turns and sees Dave come through the doorway. ,66000
CUT TO: INT. THE CHALET - LATER CU on TV screen: Mark being taken down by a wrestler. ,249000
The image pauses, plays again. ,1210000
And again. ,11400000
Mark sits in front of the screen, watching this sequence, over and over. ,775000
Dave walks in through the open door. ,83500
Mark doesn't acknowledge him. ,9200000
DAVE Why'd you take off so suddenly? ,2640000
MARK (STILL WATCHING) Need to study up. ,215000
Fix some weakness. ,14600000
DAVE You been doing this since you left? ,3780000
MARK Pretty much. ,3920
Dave stands there as Mark keeps watching. ,2700000
DAVE What's going on with you and John? ,26900000
MARK (STILL WATCHING) Nothing's going on. (BEAT) What does that mean? 71. ,191000
DAVE You seemed kind of upset in the gym. ,110000
MARK (STILL WATCHING) The fuck you talking about? ,6860000
DU PONT He was talking to you about something and you seemed pretty upset. (THEN) What was he saying to you? ,2940
MARK I don't know what you're talking about. ,16800000
DAVE Okay. ,5220
You want me to leave you alone, I'll leave you alone. ,558000
You decide you want to talk, you know where to find me. ,6880000
Dave walks out. ,1910000
Mark keeps watching his videotape. ,978000
CUT TO: I/E. ,35400000
DU PONT'S CAR/FOXCATCHER - NEXT MORNING Du Pont drives his black Mercury. ,1880
He's wearing what looks like an antique Revolutionary War General's battle COAT over a Foxcatcher t-shirt. ,26500
There are a couple of MUSKETS in the back seat, another COAT. CUT TO: EXT. DAVE'S HOUSE/FOXCATCHER - SAME TIME Dave's got the hood of his car up. ,1610

DU PONT David Schultz. ,36600
Dave. ,17400000
Dave looks around the open hood. 72. ,7220000
DAVE Hey, Coach. ,12300000
DU PONT I'd like to show you something. ,62900000
Why don't you hop in? ,8190000
It's more than a little odd that du Pont hasn't acknowledged anyone else. ,3600
DAVE WELL - DU PONT - Need to show you something. ,260000
At the battlefield. ,1950000
Sit. ,16600000
DAVE You know what, Coach? ,14800000
It's Sunday. ,1340000
Family time. ,2080000
Du Pont stands there as if he hasn't quite registered what Dave said. ,3800
Nancy calls out from the steps. ,2600000

Du Pont looks over at her as if he's just noticed her presence. ,24000
DU PONT Family time. ,87000000

Du Pont patrols the perimeter, REPEATEDLY LOOKING TOWARD the doorway. ,5650
Du Pont SEES someone entering and immediately begins acting coach-like, SHOUTING instruction, CLAPPING encouragement. ,5500
WE NOW SEE who has entered: Mrs. ,52000000
Jean du Pont. ,10300000
She's WHEELED in by an attendant; another wheels the oxygen tank she's attached to. ,1210000
They park themselves by the wall. ,52400
INTERCUT: Mark SPRINTS through the woods, breathing hard. ,126000
BACK IN THE GYM: The wrestlers notice Jean, begin to stop what they're doing. ,89800
Du Pont BLOWS HIS WHISTLE too loudly- DU PONT And.... break! Gentlemen, well done! Listen up. ,10400
Team. ,29000000
Listen up. ,1260000
Several wrestlers GLANCE toward Dave to check his reaction to this. ,13600
Dave NODS his head in du Pont's direction. ,551000
DU PONT (CONT'D) A number of you will be travelling with me to the Olympic Trials in Pensacola next week. ,21500
From the moment you leave these hallowed training grounds, you will be in competition. ,19900
There's no lying in a fight. ,1240000
Who you think you are in the moments leading up to a fight, and who you are when the fight begins - the truth will become abundantly clear. ,230000
Jean du Pont watches her son. ,74700
DU PONT (CONT'D) Raul Garcia, come up here for a moment. ,14000
No one moves. ,9050000
He gestures at Garcia. ,151000

Gecko. ,11300000
GARCIA (mutters under his breath) My fucking name's Roberto, dickweed. 74. ,544
Springer smiles. ,83
Garcia stands. ,4280
He's clearly the SMALLEST WRESTLER in the room. ,1460000
He approaches du Pont. ,51800
INTERCUT: Mark sprinting through the woods. ,12000
BACK IN THE GYM: DU PONT Muchas gracias, compadre. (gestures to the mat) Por favor. ,17
Garcia gets in the down position. ,617000
Du Pont kneels next to him, his arms hovering over him, not yet grabbing on. ,10700
DU PONT (CONT'D) The period begins before the whistle blows, when the other wrestler feels you above him, feels your purpose. ,1680
Jean watches her son, not betraying any emotion. ,154000
DU PONT (CONT'D) Then... the whistle blows! Du Pont grabs onto Garcia. ,1410
Tries to flip him. ,43
He can't move him at all. ,61700000
TOTAL SILENCE, except for Du Pont grunting. ,40600
Du Pont, stoic - watches her son. ,34400
Then she signals to her attendant to take her away. ,40900
She's wheeled out. ,327000
Du Pont sees her go. ,146000

CUT TO: Du Pont FANS Dave with a towel in between periods, "coaching him", giving "advice". ,1470000
He's BEING FILMED BY A CAMERA CREW. CUT TO: End of Dave's match. ,1370000

Mark's struggling. ,2090000
We see a vulnerability we haven't seen before - something lost or disoriented. ,7330000
Dave shouts from the corner. ,400000
DAVE Get after him, Mark! Shoot low!... ,112000
Du Pont, BEING FILMED, claps, calls out instruction - DU PONT Need to get after him, there. ,8290
Low low low. ,155000000
CUT TO: In between periods, Mark sits in the chair in his corner while Dave gets in his face, coaching. ,32500
But all Mark can pay attention to is du Pont clumsily FANNING him with a towel. ,5750
DAVE He's open to the left. ,35800000
He leaves his entire left side open. ,437000
You gotta get after that fucker! Make him pay. ,894000
Now or never... ,2460000

Mark walks off the mat. ,3820000
Dave tries to console him. ,360000
DAVE (CONT'D) Double elimination, buddy. ,234000
You'll get it back. ,66700000
DU PONT Next time, Mark. ,79500000
A good effort. 76. ,309000

DAVE (CONT'D) Mark! Mark doesn't move. ,245000
Dave starts to KICK IN the door - once, twice - it might break. ,136000
Mark goes to the door and opens it. ,483000

You got a match in four hours. (BEAT) What happened to your face? ,1850000
Mark walks away, sits on the bed. ,1460000

Look at me. ,4500000
You have a chance to do what no wrestler's done since 1904. ,6350000
Not one. ,14600000

Du Pont walks in the far side, clapping, calling out - DU PONT Here you are. ,
I've been looking all over for you -- Dave immediately trots over to du Pont, heading him off. ,
We SEE their conversation from Mark's POV (we'll hear only pieces of it): Dave explains how Mark needs to be left alone. ,
Du Pont resists at first; Dave is gentle but firm. ,
He tells du Pont he shouldn't be in Mark's corner right now. ,

DAVE - I wanted to check in with him. ,
I had a kind of uncomfortable thing with John before the match this afternoon - Mark was in a really delicate place, and I had to ask John to not be in his corner. ,
I just wanted to make sure he's okay with everything. ,
And that he's happy with the result. ,
With how things turned out. ,
STAN BECK Dave. ,

Almost mumbling: DU PONT Yes. ,
Very sad. ,
Very sad days here. ,
Here at the farm. ,
He keeps his focus on the disassembled gun, wiping clean each piece. ,
Silence, then - FRED COLE Well, whatever we can do. ,
STAN BECK What we wanted to discuss... ,
Mr. Du Pont spends a significant amount of money for wrestlers' training here at Foxcatcher. ,

CUT TO: INT. BIG HOUSE/DU PONT'S OFFICE - SAME TIME STAN BECK We believe that Eagle has earned the right to be named to the official roster of Olympic coaches at Seoul. ,
Which means he would be in Mark Schultz's corner throughout the games. ,

Stop it! Long beat as Dave looks at Mark. ,
As gently as he can: DAVE (CONT'D) I will make sure you're taken care of after Seoul. ,
I'll talk to John - whatever you decide: you want to stay, you want to go - I'll make sure you're taken care of. ,
Mark's looking at his brother, something dawning on him for the first time. ,
MARK You're not thinking of staying here...? ,
DAVE I don't know, Mark. ,
The schools are great, the kids are happy. ,
They have eight hundred acres to run around in... ,
Mark's at a complete loss. ,
Just when he'd reconnected with his brother, it seems they'll be separated again. ,

DAVE Sorry. 97. ,94300
STAN BECK - To train in whatever way is most effective for him. ,101000

And I'm a virgin, I don't know what to do, but I'd heard if you pour Coke up there you won't get pregnant-- (guys start laughing) So we went to 7-11, got a liter of Coke and drove back into the woods. ,16000
She took her panties off and did a handstand against a tree but when I start pouring, she starts screaming, "it stings, it stings" but when I'd stop, she'd scream "no don't stop" and it's fizzing out and-- INSTRUCTORS in stitches. ,799

You look like military. (03.18.14) 17. ,27100000

She's taken aback by his observation. ,231000

TAYA You're a bunch of arrogant, self-centered pricks who think you can lie and do whatever the fuck you want. (pushes him a shot) I'd never date a SEAL. (03.18.14) 18. ,832
CHRIS (confused) How can you say we're self-centered? ,304000
I'd lay down my life for my country. ,2890000
TAYA Why? ,282
CHRIS Cause it's the greatest country on earth and I believe it's worth protecting. (climbs off stool) I'm sorry this guy hurt your sister but that's not me. ,21100

TAYA Where are you going? ,29400
CHRIS You said you'd never date a SEAL, so I'm going home. ,345000

Suddenly-- clouds halt, pupils flare, chest inflates. 49 EXT. ELIZABETH STREET - SAME 49 Sun flares as MARC LEE advances alongside 1ST PLATOON MARINES (40 men) when-- A SHOT SOUNDS. A BODY TUMBLES out of the sky and lands in their midst with a meaty thud. 1ST MARINE #1 -Fuck, man! What the hell-- The Marines duck for cover then look to the sky-- 1ST MARINE #2 -Where'd it come from? ,14
MARC LEE That's your overwatch, Einstein. ,144000
You can thank him later. ,65400
Keep moving. ,1200000
Marines slowly return to standing, glancing up at surrounding structures trying to spot their protector. 50 INT. WINDOW - LATE AFTERNOON 50 Chris lays atop a baby crib. ,1360
A scrim hangs in front of him. ,23100
Sunlight burns through it, casting a thousand pinpricks of light across his face. ,32900
SUN MARCHES ACROSS the sky and pixels twist over his cataleptic shape. (03.18.14) 32. ,26
Suddenly-- sun halts, chest inflates, eyes flare. 51 INT. STREET - SAME 51 A CAR SPEEDS toward 1ST PLATOON. MARINES open fire with the feeble POP-POP of M4s. ,13
The car still coming-- A SNIPER SHOT BOOMS across the sky like thunder. ,150000
The windshield spiders, blood splattered, and the car stops. ,97100
As Marines search rooftops for him-- THE CAR EXPLODES. 52 INT. LOOTED ROOM, ELIZABETH STREET - EVENING 52 CHRIS plants a loop-hole charge at the base of the wall and steps around the corner to trigger the charge. ,5100
CUT BETWEEN: INT. HALLWAY, DOWN ELIZABETH STREET - SAME Black robes draw across mosaic tiles as "PHANTOM SNIPER" slips down a hallway. ,30
A Dragunov Sniper Rifle over shoulder, he hears the loop-hole charge detonate nearby and turns, entering a tiled washroom to his left. ,1010
This is "MUSTAFA". LOOTED ROOM / CHRIS CHRIS lays his kit in front of the blast-hole: gun, flag, Bible. ,867000
Packs a dip, elbows meet cement, eye meets glass-- WASHROOM / MUSTAFA MUSTAFA lays in front of a mortar-hole. ,14400
In a leather satchel: ammo, oil, cell phones. ,542000
His eye meets glass-- LOOTED ROOM CHRIS finds his stillness. ,68000
The instant he does-- SHADOWS CREEP over him and night swallows the room. 53 EXT. ELIZABETH STREET - NIGHT 53 A palm tree burns like a candle over Fallujah. ,25900
Below it, head-lamps dance chaotic as VIPER TEAM MARINES exit a house spray-painting "X" on the gate. (03.18.14) 33. ,113000
MARINE VIPER #1 --hot as Bigfoot's ballsack over here. (knocks on next gate) Derka, derka, derka.... ,992000
MARINE VIPERS laugh, bowling into a courtyard. ,88900
CHRIS SCOPE POV (N/V) Glowing green hue. ,68000
CROSS-HAIRS track the Marines entry, sweep the street and push toward the rooftop, when-- A SHOT SOUNDS. A MARINE FALLS in a 2nd story window. ,1580
MARINE VIPER #4 (OS) (over radio) --Fuck! Man down! It came through the window-- CROSS-HAIRS whip across rooftops, on a swivel. ,1000000
CHRIS (OC) That was sniper fire. ,275000
Shooter is on our side of Elizabeth street. ,329000
MARINE VIPER CO (OS) Negative. ,394000
East side of Elizabeth is locked-down. ,1640000
Viper Marines drag the soldier out. ,4500000
In the phosphorous green glow, we watch his body tremor as he dies. ,604000
SFX: CHRIS' ELEVATED HEARTBEAT pounds over scene as-- WASHROOM MUSTAFA flees down the hall. ,34800
A fluttering shadow in darkness, except for the reflective swoosh on his Nikes. ,5600
LOOTED ROOM Chris lays on the gun, brow pinched with onus, silence like a scream. ,10500
This happened on my watch. ,1830000
CHRIS SCOPE POV (N/V) CROSS-HAIRS TRACK across the city-scape. ,19400
TIME LAPSES and the world (in scope) SPEEDS UP. Humvees and tanks streak past, lights blur, trees blow in choppy havoc, then-- TIME SLOWS to a crawl as CROSS-HAIRS FIND A MALE hurrying into a alley, pulling shit from a pack. ,668
We zero-in and-- a flame flickers. ,1700000
The male is smoking opium. (03.18.14) 34. ,1660000
CROSS-HAIRS drift off him and TIME SPEEDS UP, dogs eat a rotting body by the roadside, vicious in fast motion. ,538
TWO WOMEN wobble down the road with buckets, wind whips roadside grass into a tizzy and WE HALT ON-- CROSS-HAIRS ON A PERFECT CIRCLE in the grass, a rifle- barrel? ,76
Stay on it. ,2840000
In stillness it finds context; a RUSTY PIPE. TIME SPEEDS FORWARD, TWO BOYS zip by on a Vespa, OLD MEN frantically bow to mecca on rooftops. ,2330000
Clouds boil across dawn sky. ,27500
His eye never leaves glass. ,3190000
MARC LEE Smells like piss in here. (no response) You covered our ass out there, man. ,443
Appreciate it. ,1860000
Those were ballsy shots. ,28200
CHRIS KYLE And they were clean. ,442000
MARC LEE Hell yeah, they were. ,60500
CHRIS (finally looks up) That sniper walked right up our ass. ,807000
MARC LEE I chewed out our security detail. ,1290000
It won't happen again. ,651000
CHRIS My shooter statements are on the dresser. ,337000
Marc Lee picks up a stack of YELLOW PAPERS on the desk. ,21200000
MARC LEE Six? ,8520000
CHRIS Should be eight. ,
Two got dragged off. (off Marc) Something wrong? ,1720000
MARC LEE No... but you got more kills than the rest of the snipers combined. ,10600
Chris rubs red "shooter's strawberries" from his elbows. ,28800
CHRIS They still got one of our guys. (03.18.14) 35. ,346000
MARC LEE You can't shoot what you can't see. ,72900000
Marc's eyes land on piss-stained cement where Chris lay; this fucker didn't take his eye off the glass all night. 54 EXT. CAMP FALLUJAH -FORWARD OPERATING BASE(FOB)- EVENING 54 Behind miles of wire, a twenty-acre BASE CAMP. Aluminum trailers, shithouses and tent farms. ,50500
A Humvee pulls past-- 55 INT. CHARLIE COMPANY BARRACKS, CAMP FALLUJAH - NIGHT 55 Chris steps in, letting the air-conditioning blow down on him. ,1130
Cots, lockers and cruise-boxes line the room. ,1370000
Biggles reads a PUNISHER graphic novel, doesn't look up. ,18900
BIGGLES Heard you got your dick wet. ,
CHRIS Where is everybody? ,7310000
BIGGLES We're just picking our dicks here, training those fucking haji soldiers. ,39500
CHRIS Why ain't you out there? ,1180000
BIGGLES I got the shits. ,716000
Marc Lee said you were on fuckin fire out there. ,234000
CHRIS (shedding gear) You still read comic books? ,289000
BIGGLES It's a fuckin graphic novel. ,68100
Talk to me, man. ,4010000
Did you pop your cherry? ,5520000
A heaviness falls over Chris, then slowly-- CHRIS This kid didn't even have hair on his balls and his mom hands him a grenade-- sends him running off to kill Marines. ,18200
BIGGLES (sees his hurt) You saw his balls? (03.18.14) 36. ,570000
CHRIS It was evil, man. ,4930000
That was hate like I've never seen it before. ,117000
BIGGLES That kid could've taken out ten Marines-- CHRIS (wrestling with it) I know. ,11600
BIGGLES You did your job. ,43200000
End of fuckin story. ,1540
CHRIS It's just not how you imagine the first one going down. ,115000000
BIGGLES How about the other ones? ,25200
What about the other kills? ,18600000
CHRIS The other ones-- were righteous. ,87300
Like God was blowing on my bullets. ,145000
He's joking but not. ,987000
Biggles smiles, jealous. ,12400000
SNIPER SEQUENCE OVERWATCH CROSS-HAIRS land on INSURGENT WITH RIFLE; INSURGENT PEEPING three times; INSURGENT BURYING IEDs. BAM-BAM-BAM. ANOTHER SNIPER (OS) --that you again Kyle? ,10900
CROSS-HAIRS are moving, no answer follows. ,133000
MARINE INTEL TRAILER Chris is covered in dust, sitting in a small chair facing two clean, well rested JAG OFFICERS. JAG OFFICER Our task here is to make sure every kill is a righteous kill and conforms to ROEs. CHRIS By every kill, do you mean just our kills or you're monitoring the bad guys too? (03.18.14) 37. ,
JAG OFFICER #2 Your scores at sniper school were average at best, then you get here and you're just lighting the world on fire? ,3780000
Chris opens a PLASTIC WATER BOTTLE, sips it, waits-- CHRIS Sorry, was that a question? ,22900
OVERWATCH Chris takes over for a MARINE SNIPER in a window. ,115000
MARINE SNIPER Haven't seen shit all day. ,126000
Maybe the war is over and they forgot to tell us. ,159000
Chris settles in, still going through his ritual when AN INSURGENT crosses the street with CAR BATTERY and AK-47. ,4510
CHRIS (keys mike) I got a armed military-aged male moving tactically with a car battery. ,37
Maybe he needs a jump? ,1680000

MARINE INTEL TRAILER CHRIS scrunches that EMPTY WATER BOTTLE, gratingly, as JAG OFFICERS continue the interrogation: JAG OFFICER His wife said he was carrying a Koran. ,17500
CHRIS Well, I don't know what a Koran looks like but I can describe what he was carrying-- it was pressed metal, fired 7.62s and looked just like an AK-47. ,1200
MESS HALL (03.18.14) 38. ,266000
CHRIS, BIGGLES, D and DAUBER enter. ,1480
Eyes find them, heads nodding to Chris, that the guy? ,1200000

Biggles sees it, hops up on a chair-- BIGGLES Listen up ladies and genitals. ,8380
The Legend here would like you to know that when it comes to sniping it's better to be lucky than good! Our boy here has a Texas horseshoe crammed so far up his ass that-- Chris flings a cafeteria tray at his head. 56 EXT. ROOFTOP - DAWN 56 In murky predawn light, CHRIS sits on a SATELLITE PHONE-- TAYA (OS) Have you killed anyone yet? ,13
CHRIS That's not how the call-home goes, babe. ,52400000
TAYA (OS) Don't be weird with me. ,2640000

Chris covers the phone as distant gunfire chatters. ,115000
INTER-CUT WITH: 57 INT. CHRIS & TAYA'S HOUSE, SAN DIEGO - SAME 57 TAYA sits in front of a partially assembled baby-crib with a six month baby bump. ,3750000
She turns down the TV. CHRIS There are things we can't say over the phone. ,161000
TAYA (playful) You knocked me up and now I'm stuck here by myself assembling baby-cribs and you can't talk to me? ,11600
That's the big plan? ,288000000
HIS CROSS-HAIRS track across a distant rooftop. ,4100
Socks sway from a clothesline in a 5 knot breeze. ,58100
TAYA You guys almost done over there yet? (03.18.14) 39. ,286000
CHRIS I can't stop thinking about that pink silky thing you wore on our honeymoon... ,904000
TAYA It's called a nightgown. ,188000
CHRIS Yeah-- TAYA And three days is not a honeymoon. ,1630000
CHRIS It was a good three days. ,428000
I miss you bad. ,54600000
TAYA (curls up in chair) You want me to talk dirty to you? ,69500
CHRIS Yeah. ,19200
But I got my gun in one hand and the phone in the other-- TAYA Well, you'll just have to decide what's more important. ,587000
CHRIS You're horny preggers. ,540000
TAYA Fat and horny. ,
It's kinda disgusting. ,25800000
CHRIS You could be 300 pounds I'd still do you. ,2680000
She's touched, hormonal, starts crying. ,302000
TAYA -So romantic. ,700000
CHRIS How's my boy? ,32600
TAYA Nobody said it's a boy-- CROSS-HAIRS TRACK INSURGENTS on the street; then linger on a parked car, measuring distance by height-- CHRIS I can't wait to see the way you are with him. ,146000
You're gonna be incredible. (03.18.14) 40. ,773000
TAYA (harbors doubt) How do you know? ,53500000
CHRIS I just know. ,10400000
I can see it. ,205000000
TAYA I hope you're right. ,695000
Her face falls as-- TV NEWS shows the graphic of "American Death Toll in Iraq." The number is 835. ,28100
TAYA (suddenly) Did your dad get hold of you? ,64700000
CHRIS I haven't checked any email. ,798000
CROSS-HAIRS follow insurgents as they slip out of view. ,19000
TAYA Shit. ,78
You need to call him. ,163000
Hang up and-- CHRIS What happened? ,3630000
TAYA I'm so selfish. ,2110000
I wasn't even thinking-- CHRIS Taya. ,2870000
TAYA Your little brother deployed. ,140000
CHRIS What happened to jump school? ,49500
I thought-- TAYA He didn't get in. ,10200000
Just call your dad-- CHRIS Deployed where? ,2910000
Where's he going? ,54000000
TAYA Over there. ,3
He's headed to Iraq. ,357000

COL. GRONSKI His name is "Zarqawi" and he is the prince of al-Qaeda in Iraq. ,10400
AQI, his mercenary army, are 5000 strong. ,28600
They're trained well, paid well and waging the heaviest urban combat since Vietnam. ,71900
FIND CHRIS in back, scanning heads for his brother Jeff. ,430000
COL. GRONSKI Zarqawi and his Lieutenants are our highest priority. ,11900
Only way to root them out is to go house-to-house until we find them, or someone who will reveal their whereabouts. ,611000
We need to clear ten structures an hour. ,40200000
It's aggressive so we'll loosen things up with air support-- Chris looks to Marc Lee, ten structures an hour? 59 EXT. CAMP FALLUJAH - MORNING 59 The sun hangs like a blood-clot in the sky. ,637
Chris and Marc Lee are walking, TALKING LOW-- CHRIS These Marines rush in like they been doing, they'll get their asses shot off. ,7070
MARC LEE They're Marines. ,8520000
They don't get the training we do. ,60800000
Half of them were civilians six months ago. ,433000
Chris reacts, hearing him describing Jeff. (03.18.14) 42. ,526000
CHRIS So let's coach them up. ,20000000
I'll show them how Team Guys do it and lead a unit in the street. ,4770000
MARC LEE Can't do. ,91100000
We need you on overwatch. ,101000000
CHRIS But if I was down in the street-- MARC LEE House-to-house is the deadliest job here. ,731000
You got some kind of savior complex? ,2880000
Maybe. ,16400000
CHRIS I just wanna get the bad guys. ,512000
And I can't shoot them if I can't see `em. ,63100000
MARC LEE You got a hot hand. ,65300000
These Marines all know your name now and they think they're invincible with you up there. ,3070000
CHRIS They're not-- MARC LEE They are if they believe they are. ,12100000
Just keep banging on the long-gun and let these ground-pounders sniff out Zarqawi. ,31500
Marc walks off leaving Chris biting at a shamal wind. ,86
CUT TO: AN F-18 RIPS OVERHEAD firing 500lb JDAMs into the next block. ,1150
Smoke and dust billow outward-- 60 INT. ROOFTOP 60 Under a fluttering canopy, CHRIS lays on the gun, cursing zero visibility. ,75
GOAT camps nearby, on a GameBoy. ,163000
CHRIS You said that AQI sniper was in the Olympics-- but Iraq hasn't qualified a shooter in the last three games. ,10600
GOAT Mustafa's not Iraqi. ,3870000
He's from Syria. (03.18.14) 43. ,3130000
Chris steals a glance at him, processing this as-- CHRIS SCOPE POV KILO COMPANY MARINES JOG to a pink house with windows boarded up. ,83
One of the Marines looks like Jeff Kyle. ,492000
CHRIS (keys mike) Once you make entry I can't see shit, so keep it slow and push through the target. "Jeff Marine" sets a charge, turns-- not Jeff. ,14
The door blows off. ,10300000
Marines rush in. ,563000
GUNFIRE POPS. Marines rush back out, dragging a WOUNDED MARINE. CHRIS Fuck this-- I'm going down to clear houses with the Marines. ,19600
You coming? ,1740000
GOAT No man. ,11700000
No. I like my life. ,2590000
I wanna make it home. ,27300000
I go fishing and do all kind of cool shit. ,581000
It's not my job to knock down doors. ,1320000
Those guys picked the wrong fucking job. ,208000
I ain't doing that shit. ,936000
CHRIS (smiles) If I don't see you down there, you make sure I don't see you again. 61 INT. STREET, SOLDIER'S DISTRICT - MINUTES LATER 61 KILO COMPANY firing on the structure. "CPT. GILLESPIE" (smart, sunburned) is shouting "hold your fire" as-- CHRIS (bowls up) You wanna be a sniper? ,28

CPT. GILLESPIE Hey, any Navy Seal is cool by me. "THOMPSON" (big, wobbly voice) nods, lugging an M240G. (03.18.14) 44. ,6
THOMPSON You're that guy. ,4450000
They're calling you The Legend. ,4570000
You got like 24 confirmed kills. ,53800000
He recognizes his way to gain entry, so he plays it up. ,959000
CHRIS It's 32. ,2
But who's counting. ,6510000
THOMPSON That's badass. "SANCHEZ" (neck tattoos, Catholic) chimes in. ,70000
SANCHEZ There's some boy in Bravo catching up. ,548000
CHRIS KYLE (packs a dip) Y'all are meateaters for sure but I got a little training I could show you, some simple shit, that might just keep us above ground. ,189000
His need to protect cloaked beneath cool cowboy calm. 62 OMITTED 62 63 EXT. MICHIGAN STREET - OUTSIDE THE WIRE - DAY 63 KILO COMPANY are doing house-to-house. ,7430

They clear the room, CHRIS teaching them how to move together, giving hand signals. ,178000
SANCHEZ (low) -Whas that mean again? ,449000
GILLESPIE Cover and follow. ,318000
He follows Chris into a room with sofas, exotic rugs and-- (03.18.14) 45. ,65400
A KID(12) stands across the room with dark eyes and pronounced forehead, staring at Chris. ,8840
CHRIS Down. ,23200
Down! On the floor, now! THE KID is rocking on his heels like he's going to run. ,2070000
CHRIS I will fucking shoot you! Down! Get down-- FATHER OF KID (OS) No, please-- THE FATHER runs in, tall and bearded. ,47200
Gillespie clocks him and he drops. ,37700
The Kid screams like he's deaf. ,2120000
FATHER OF KID (from the floor) Please! He can't understand. ,5250000
Look at him-- GILLESPIE He does look a little retarded. ,7730000
CHRIS You were ordered to evacuate. ,2310000
Why are you still here? ,84800000
FATHER OF KID This is our home. ,1230000
I won't give it to them. ,5030000
Or to you. ,5250000
SANCHEZ pushes THREE WOMEN (in berkas) into the room. ,21500
SANCHEZ I found these bitches in the back closet. ,1730000
FATHER OF KID I'm Sheikh al-Obeidi. ,73100
You are my guest but please tell the others to come inside. ,8390000
If they are in the street he will know we have spoken. ,37100000
SANCHEZ This sand nig' want us in here so he can blow us up. ,847000
A KETTLE whistles in the kitchen. ,59700
Guns still trained. ,13600000
CHRIS Who will know we've spoken? (03.18.14) 46. ,2480000
SHEIK AL-OBEIDI/FATHER Your enemy is mine enemy. ,87300
We share this. ,370000
Chris studies the women, and lowers his gun. ,14600000
CHRIS Bring the other guys in. ,26800
TIME CUT - LATER Chris and Gillespie sit with "SHEIK AL-OBEIDI" while the kid ("OMAR") plays with his father's hair. ,8230
SHEIKH AL-OBEIDI If we talk to US soldiers he will come to our home and make examples of us-- CHRIS Who is he? ,2380
I need a name. ,103000000
The Marine Interpreter aka "TERP" (20s, in mismatched camo, face bandanna) repeats the question. ,1250
SHEIKH AL-OBEIDI The man who comes we call The Butcher. ,66400
He is the despaired one, son of Shaytan-- Sheik mumbles in Arabic, fearing the words on his tongue. ,3610
TERP He calls him - the pure flame of fire- . ,172000
Basically, this man comes to their house and prey on the weak with hurt. ,1740000
CHRIS So he's some kind of enforcer? ,167000
SHEIKH AL-OBEIDI Enforcer. ,12300
Top soldier of Zarqawi. ,25600
CHRIS (jumps) We want Zarqawi. ,14700
Where do we find Zarqawi? ,341000
OMAR CACKLES like a crow, playing peeking games. ,52500
SHEIKH AL-OBEIDI If you find The Butcher you will see he reports direct to Zarqawi each day. ,3470
An F-18 rips overhead. ,960000
RADIO CHATTER. THOMPSON steps out-- (03.18.14) 47. ,176000
CHRIS How do we find him? ,205000
SHEIKH AL-OBEIDI You must understand the risk to us. ,81900000
TERP He will ask for money. ,39200
SHEIKH AL-OBEIDI We need one hundred thousand US dollars. ,233000
THE BOOM of distant ordinance shakes the structure. ,16500
CHRIS We don't even have proof this guy exists. ,8800000
The Sheik grabs his wife, pulls her arm from her robe-- her hand has been hacked off, the stump healing. ,8080
SHEIKH AL-OBEIDI Is this not proof? ,11700
CHRIS I'm sorry. ,2660000
I want to help you. ,76700000
But I need names, places, phone numbers-- THOMPSON (rushes in) Hey, we got a Marine unit pinned down in a house just uprange-- CHRIS Give me a name, Sheik. ,35500
Give me something. ,2890000
THOMPSON They're out of ammo. ,716000
If we don't go now-- Sheik stonewalling, Chris stands to go, fuck-- SHEIKH AL-OBEIDI "Amir Khalaf Fanus". ,578
This is given name of The Butcher. ,3750000
But to help you find him-- Sheikh Obeidi SWEEPS A HAND across his open palm, pay me. ,528000

A game of solitaire open on his computer. ,2090000
CORNHUSKER football posters on his wall. ,273000
AGENT SHEAD I guess that translates to "pay me" in just about any language, doesn't it? ,23900
CHRIS Yes sir, it does. ,404000
MARC LEE And you're the secret squirrel with the cash, right? ,188000
AGENT SHEAD (not amused) When you were having tea with Sheik al- Obedie did he tell you he ran a network of highway bandits before AQI moved in? ,3
CHRIS KYLE He left that part out. ,11100000
AGENT SHEAD That's AQI's racket now. ,4400
Your Sheik got edged out. ,13800
This could be blowback. ,13
CHRIS Or he could be upset The Butcher cut off his wife's hand. ,162000
Either way, seems like you'd wanna explore it. ,917000
Shead would rather not enter into this with them but-- he slides a white-board to reveal an AQI HIERARCHY. AGENT SHEAD This is your guy here. (points to photo directly under Zarqawi) We believe The Butcher is Zarqawi's number two man. ,3
THE BUTCHER is a squat, rawboned man with eyebrows forming a grizzled line over dark bloodshot eyes. ,12100
CHRIS But you don't know his real name or you'd have it written up there. (03.18.14) 49. ,1130000

TAYA McKenna's about to lose that tooth and I'm worried she's going to swallow it. ,873
She said she'd let you pull it. ,1570000

TAYA (OC) No! He's a puppy. ,301000
He doesn't know! Chris looks up, bent with animus, and he's looking at the face of his children, their friends, and their parents-- They look at him, terrified. ,20500

The light spills in and we see. ,1640000
EXT. UPPER MIDDLE CLASS RESIDENTIAL HOUSE, QUEENS NYC - SUNRISE Open on ABEL MORALES. It is early morning and still almost dark out. ,21700
He has a rugged yet prosperously-handsome face and is in his mid-thirties. ,38100
He is struggling to get started with his morning jog. ,657000
EXT. SHIP GRAVEYARD, STATEN ISLAND NYC - DAY It is early morning. ,120000
A large bulk fuel oil transport truck sits idling next to a decrepit old dock. ,17000
The dock sticks into a backwater section of New York harbor that is filled with the decaying remains of half-sunken abandoned barges and tug boats. ,542
JULIAN, the young driver of the truck sits and nervously scans the horizon. ,24800
Eventually a large fuel barge appears in the distance being pushed by a tug boat. ,4440
The barge is steered past the skeletons of the other sunken ships and makes its way to the dock in front of the tanker truck. ,4530
JULIAN gets out of his truck and readies a large connecting hose. ,60500
He looks around nervously. ,270000
JULIAN steps across the broken boards of the dock and struggles to get the hose to the barge. ,45900
He hands it to the BARGE OPERATOR with a nod of the head and no words. ,42200
They connect the hose and start a large generator as it begins to pump fuel into the truck. ,120000
They both scan the horizon again as the sun begins to come up. ,3820000
EXT. MORE INDUSTRIAL QUEENS NEIGHBORHOOD- SAME TIME ABEL is still jogging as the light begins to increase. ,76
It is freezing out. ,13700000
He is a very serious guy. ,303000
He is not happy that he is out of shape. ,52400000
Finally he stops and bends over to catch his breath. ,2070000
We have run with him from the nicer part of the neighborhood to a rougher section. ,57900
As he catches his breath he stands up and looks around. ,63900000
He is unsure of his feelings. 3 INT. ANNA'S DRESSING AREA The camera slowly moves in as ANNA sits in a slip at her make up table putting on her face for the day ahead. ,1050
She looks into the mirror as if she is putting on a coat of armor. ,93000
INT. DRIVER'S CAB OF A BULK OIL TRANSPORT TRUCK - DAY STANDARD HEATING OIL, "We set the Standard" is written in logo form on the side of the tank. ,133000
The truck idles in traffic waiting to pay the toll to cross the Verrazano bridge that spans the mouth of New York harbor. ,54700
JULIAN, the young driver from the dock, cautiously looks around as the traffic inches along. ,62900
He finally approaches the toll booth and pays. ,69700
JULIAN Good morning. ,3790000
JULIAN speaks English with a well-sanded accent. ,281000
Is it Central American or Mexican? ,1020000
The female collector gives him a smile. ,312000
He heads through the booth, but there is still traffic on the other side as the lanes merge together. ,22500
Just as the traffic is about to pick up he looks in his rearview mirror and we see TWO GUYS come walking through the traffic and towards the cab. ,36700
Before we know it they are climbing up the cab steps. ,270000
The GUY on the driver's side, LOUIS SERVIDIO, is small and very slight but he moves with great speed and strength. ,9220
He shatters the glass side window with his elbow. ,2890000
Unlocks the door just as his partner, THUG #2, does the same thing on the passenger side, but he is holding a gun. ,4070000
They are not wearing masks. ,31600000
It's very brazen. ,906000
Before THUG #2 even asks JULIAN to get out of the cab LOUIS SERVIDIO crushes him in the jaw with three swift punches then pulls him out of the cab and down onto the roadway. ,2080000
LOUIS SERVIDIO pulls the door shut and they drive away with the truck leaving JULIAN sitting in the middle of the road staring, as blood starts to flow from his jaw. ,1580
INT. PARKING YARD OF STANDARD HEATING OIL- SAME TIME Two almost-matching late model Mercedes pull up to a chain- link gate with a small sign that says "STANDARD HEATING OIL: WE SET THE STANDARD". The DISPATCHER opens the gate. 4 They both pull into reserved parking spaces next to each other. ,8790
ABEL is dressed in a very tasteful custom made suit. ,72200
ABEL's wife ANNA was driving the car behind him. ,4210000
She is a beautiful, tall, blonde woman dressed to the nines but with a streak in her eye that this is all business. ,208000
You would not want to cross this woman. ,63800000
ABEL Ready? ,2120
ANNA Yes. ,20600
ABEL You look very nice. ,275000
ANNA Thank you. ,24200000
ABEL You sure? ,4320000
ANNA Yes. ,20600
ABEL walks around and opens his trunk. ,86500
He takes out two large empty briefcases. ,4580000
He carries the briefcases as they both walk over to a large, unmarked, armored van that is idling in the middle of the parking lot. ,2700
Two ARMED GUARDS get out of the van. ,4160000
One is holding a clipboard. ,458000
He walks up to ANNA and ABEL. He hands them the clipboard. ,349000
They look at each other one last time and then both sign the document. ,1290000
The other GUARD opens up the back of the truck. ,9210000
ABEL hands him the briefcases and the guard begins to fill them with cash. ,34600
Lots of cash. ,15800000
ABEL and ANNA stand at the open back of the van and just watch. ,1230000
Finally he finishes and hands the now- heavy cases to ABEL. ABEL picks up the two cases and walks a bit away from the truck. ,44100
He turns to ANNA. ANNA (CONT'D) Don't do anything stupid. ,78500000
ABEL We don't have any more money so what else could I do. ,54900000
She gives a small smile. ,2720000
He looks at his watch. ,62700
They kiss. 5 ABEL turns and begins walking with the cases. ,755000
He gives a nod to the DISPATCHER, who we now see, is in a small gatehouse, and he begins to open the front gate. ,10500
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE THE FRONT GATE- SAME TIME ABEL walks out through the gate and down the abandoned industrial street about 25 yards, then looks to his right. ,33800
He looks down at the cases in his hands, turns, and stands looking into the neighboring site. ,35800
EXT. MASSIVE OIL TANK FARM: BROOKLYN NY WATERFRONT - DAY ABEL comes walking across the parking lot and sees ANDREW WALSH standing in the middle of the dusty parking lot. ,23600
ANDREW is their longtime LAWYER/RIGHT-HAND MAN and is in his mid fifties. ,276000
He is smart but tired. ,2990000
The oversized briefcase in his left hand seems to have permanently tilted his posture that direction. ,14300
The large oil-holding tanks loom above them. ,90600
The place is rusting and could use some work. ,21400000
As they wait, the setting has the look and choreography of an illegal transaction about to go down. ,73800
ANDREW WALSH So how are we this morning? ,79000
ABEL (gives a smile and nod) ANDREW WALSH Well I woke up feeling very good about this. ,68
ABEL Really? ,2620
They both take a look at their watches. ,5680000
ABEL (CONT'D) You've been telling me not to do this for a year. ,184000
ANDREW WALSH Well we are going all in... so now I love it. ,817000
Gives him another slight smile. ,838000
They stand around in awkward silence. ,66100
Finally a late-model Ford Ltd. station wagon pulls into the lot. 6 ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D) Here we go. ,233000
And a group of FIVE HASIDIC JEWS gets out. ,64100
There are two guys in their twenties, two in their fifties, and one in his mid- to-late seventies. ,101000
They all shake each other's hands then stand around for a beat. ,592000
ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D) Should we head inside? ,161000
INT. SMALL TEMPORARY OFFICE TRAILER - DAY The group is now jammed around a folding table inside the trailer. ,107000
ABEL and his lawyer sit at one end facing the rest of them. ,266000
Finally, the senior member of the group, JOSEPH MENDELSOHN, eyes up ABEL and leans forward. ,1280
His accent is strong yet you can understand every word. ,3900000
JOSEPH So why is it you want this land? ,101000000
ABEL I'm sorry? ,2370000
JOSEPH It has been difficult for you to get me here, no? ,50100000
Over a year? ,7140000
ABEL Almost two. ,38200
JOSEPH There are many like it around? ,784000
And thanks to all these tests you paid for, we now know it is as much of a mess below the ground as it is above. ,257000
My people have looked at your books, I know this is a lot of money for you, so why have you kept on us so... just for this ugly and polluted little piece of the earth. ,17500
ABEL I have been looking over my fence at this property for a very long time. ,13500000
JOSEPH So it is just proximity? 7 ABEL No... ,73700
I imagine I want it for the same reason you did. ,1740000
ABEL To grow. ,10400000
JOSEPH Well, I am in the garment business so I appreciate that sentiment. ,306000
But I inherited this land from my uncle. ,1460000
Sadly he had no children of his own. ,13400000
He was the one that let them build these tanks here. ,21100000
So this place can do little for me... in fact thanks to all those tests you've done it may be a liability. ,2440000
As you know I offered to lease the site to you at a fair price, but you were not interested? ,1340000
ABEL No. JOSEPH Why not? ,7940000
ABEL I like to own the things I use. ,26100000
JOSEPH I can see that. ,5
Long pause. ,291000
ABEL So. JOSEPH Yes. ,716000
This contract here, your lawyers have fully reviewed it? ,1560000
ANDREW WALSH Of course. ,71300
JOSEPH And you have brought the money? (ABEL nodes yes) So you realize you have only thirty days to close this transaction? (MORE) 8 JOSEPH (CONT'D) No extensions, no... contingencies whatsoever. ,2210
ABEL I understand. ,31
JOSEPH I want you to know this up front. ,41900000
I am a very fair man but I believe in honoring contracts. ,2680000
You will fulfill your end of this contract and the property is yours. ,958000
If you can't we will keep your money and will sell it to your competitor who has been chasing us almost as badly as you have. ,699000
I like you, but know that the only reason I am choosing you is because of the favorable terms of this contract. ,181000
So this is business... and when you sign this.... ,2160000
ABEL I understand. ,31
JOSEPH Well then, let's see this money, and then I will sign these papers. ,526000
ABEL turns to ANDREW and gives a slight nod. ,54600
ANDREW pulls the black briefcase onto the table and opens it. ,68500
It has seven hundred thousand dollars in cash in it. ,1470000
He slides it over to their side. ,3400000
The old man signs the contract and they shake hands. ,349000
EXT. MASSIVE OIL TANK FARM PARKING LOT - DAY ABEL stands next to ANDREW's car. ,45700
ANDREW WALSH Congratulations. ,151000
ABEL It's not ours yet. ,108000
ANDREW WALSH Well, it was a hell of a job just getting them to this point. ,44000
It's a good day for us. ,203000000
Take a walk around. ,38100000
Enjoy it for a second. ,16800000
ANDREW gets in his car and drives away. ,4310000
ABEL looks around and decides to go for a little walk. 9 He heads out towards the tanks and walks among them. ,27800
They tower seven stories above him. ,2130000
As he walks, he is cut off like a maze from any other visual input. (Similar to being inside a Richard Serra sculpture) Finally he emerges into some light and as ABEL looks up the camera reveals his view. ,6190
It's midtown Manhattan in all its glory, just across the East River from the site. ,553000
He stares at the city and we see the true depths of his ambition lock on his face. ,1730000
INT. 1981 MERCEDES 500 SEC ABEL drives away from New York City. ,116000
We see it behind his head. ,7910000
INT. CAR ON MERRITT PARKWAY The terrain turns to upscale country. ,6150000
EXT. COUNTRY HOUSE - DAY ABEL's car drives into a long driveway through the woods. ,63700
Then an architect-designed, 80's modern house, still under construction, appears. ,139000
He pulls up in front. ,3410000
He gets out of the car and stands there looking at the large house. ,16600000
He walks into the house and we see more clearly that it is nearing completion. ,65800
It is empty. ,12000000
INT. 80'S MODERN HOUSE - DAY ABEL walks over to the massive floor-to-ceiling windows and stands looking over the large pond that sits down the hill from the house. ,38600
As he stares out his CONTRACTOR comes quietly walking in behind him. ,328000
CONTRACTOR Hello? ,4070
ABEL There he is. ,14300000
He walks up behind him and they both look out in silence for a beat. ,474000
ABEL (CONT'D) You have done a beautiful job here. ,124000
CONTRACTOR Thank you. 10 ABEL I mean it. ,835000
You and your men should be very proud. ,77600000
CONTRACTOR We are. ,22700000
ABEL Most people don't have anything beautiful like this to show for their day's work. ,30300000
You are a lucky man. ,21400000
CONTRACTOR I am. ,25800000
ABEL Well I thank you... my family will be very happy here. ,3180000
CONTRACTOR I hope so. ,128000
ABEL Now I think I owe you some money. ,51900000
CONTRACTOR That may be true. ,33200000
ABEL It is. ,11200
ABEL reaches into his jacket pocket and takes out a thick envelope of cash. ,182000
As he does we see a transformation of his personality from pleasant philosopher to a direct voice of unquestioned authority. ,4010
ABEL (CONT'D) This is the seventeen outstanding. ,1550
But we are arriving here in four days. ,187000
It must be done. ,1540000
CONTRACTOR Yes. ,34700
ABEL Well, I'll let you go. ,1620000
He says this as he leads him to the door. ,5830000
ABEL (CONT'D) And the tile in the master bath... 11 CONTRACTOR It's being replaced, as I mentioned to your wife, that was an error on our part. ,699
Congratulations on your home. ,571000000
ABEL Thank you. ,26700000
EXT. TOP OF HILL ON OTHER SIDE OF POND LOOKING BACK AT HIS HOUSE. - DAY ABEL stands, surrounded by massive trees in the thick forest, looking across the ridge back at his house. ,21600
He is a little out of breath after climbing the hill but he looks strangely comfortable even though he is standing in the woods in a suit, tie, and dress shoes. ,9530
He takes a nice cigar out of his pocket, lights it and has a real moment of joy. ,117000
He looks up to the tops of the trees, then back at the new house. ,20700000
He exhales a long deep breath. ,572000
Then we hear a large truck come rumbling in the driveway. ,1110000
He hears it. ,2790000
His face shows that he knows the sound immediately. ,1150000
EXT. HOUSE DRIVEWAY - DAY ABEL comes out of the woods and sees a smaller heating oil delivery truck (with the same Standard Heating Oil logo) parked in the driveway. ,7100
His face shows it probably isn't great news. ,56900000
INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY ABEL comes down a hallway and then turns through a curtain into a treatment area. ,1980
Sitting on the table is the young driver of the truck, JULIAN. He has a contraption on his head that is holding his jaw shut in place. ,32100
His eye is black. ,5690000
ABEL goes over and gives him a tight hug. ,617000
But then he ever so slightly checks himself and places him back down on the table. ,84100
ABEL looks up and sees ANNA, standing in the corner. ,528000
She is all business. ,149000000
ANNA They broke his jaw. ,1460000
ABEL Have they found the truck? 12 ANNA Yes. ,1060000
ABEL Are you alright? ,4370000
JULIAN (NODS YES) ABEL Have the police been here yet? ,8100
ANNA He was left in the middle of the highway without a truck, they brought him in. ,695000
ABEL Can you speak? ,15000000
ANNA'S temper is rising. ,163000
ANNA Not for a couple days... ,49600
Can I speak with you outside? ,27500000
ANNA heads out into the hallway. ,54400
ABEL looks around a beat then follows. ,4290000
EXT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY -SAME TIME ANNA is waiting in the hallway. ,19100
ANNA Did they sign the contract? ,11000000
ABEL Yes. ,5040
ANNA And took the deposit? ,5020000
ABEL Yes. ,5040
ABEL (he gives a nice nod yes) ANNA Congratulations. 13 ABEL To you as well. ,176000
ANNA We have thirty days? ,1500000
He nods ever so slightly yes, and she gives him a knowing smile back of equal measure. ,14900
We are beginning to see that they actually work quite well together. ,1710000
ABEL These fucking guys. ,7
This poor kid has been working his ass off. ,7290000
ANNA Do you want me to speak to my Brother about this? ,5870000
ABEL No...don't talk to him or your father. ,590000
ANNA This can't continue. ,10900000
ABEL It won't. ,927000
ANNA It will if we don't do something. ,29900000
ABEL I'm meeting with the D.A. in the morning. ,614000
He's more interested in coming after us than helping us. ,2490000
ABEL looks around in disapproval. ,18600
She thinks this through and then looks in at JULIAN. ANNA (CONT'D) It's not fair to them. ,57600
You're at war here. ,3070000
ABEL No we are not. ,2560000
ANNA Really... because they are. 14 ABEL Well I'm not. ,618000
They look each other over. ,14500000
She then finally leans in and gives him a caring kiss, she walks off. ,332000
ANNA And you're going out to check on the new house? ,54400000
ABEL Yes. ,5040
He watches her walk away then looks back into the hospital room. ,3740000
He enters. ,513000
INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY ABEL walks into the room and looks at JULIAN. He looks up and ABEL has trouble putting it to words. ,15200
ABEL I have to get going. ,2470000
JULIAN gives a nod. ,30800
ABEL (CONT'D) Can we get you anything? ,111000
Nods no. ,30800
ABEL (CONT'D) We'll pick you up when they let you out of here. ,163000
ABEL (CONT'D) These men are cowards. ,80900
Too weak to make a living... or even fight with their own hands, and too stupid to think up anything else to do. ,97100
Finally he turns and leaves. ,64600
EXT. ABANDONED RACETRACK PARKING LOT - QUEENS NY - DAY ABEL drives up to the drop off scene. ,115000
There is the large bulk transport truck and one lone police car just sitting in the middle of the parking lot. 15 ABEL gets out, walks up, and stops to stare at the truck. ,26500
A young beat cop is sitting on the hood of his car waiting. ,442000
ABEL May I take it? ,136000
BEAT COP Excuse me? ,4610000
ABEL May I take it now? ,3830000
BEAT COP Is it yours? ,3700000
ABEL Yes. ,5040
BEAT COP Well, I'm sorry about that. ,13500000
Once the owner or an owner's representative files the claim form in Corona she's yours... again. ,57600
ABEL So you guys have done what you needed to? ,1540000
BEAT COP Yes. ,3790000
BEAT COP I'm sorry? ,2700000
ABEL You just said you've done what you needed to... so what was it that you've done? ,24900000
BEAT COP (looks back dumbfounded) ABEL Did you fingerprint or anything? ,14100
BEAT COP No need, these guys always wear gloves. ,93600
ABEL So you've done nothing. 16 BEAT COP I'm not exactly sure, I just got here at four. ,36300
My shift is actually up. ,12400000
ABEL So who's coming? ,95000000
They stare at each other, then the truck. ,10300000
ABEL then climbs up and we see he knows his way around the truck. ,46400
He goes up top and opens and looks into a valve, the tank is empty. ,86600
BEAT COP Sorry. ,3690000
The cop gets in his car and prepares to drive away. ,6350000
BEAT COP (CONT'D) Why did they want it? ,94600
ABEL They stole the $6,000 of fuel that was in it. ,28800
The cop leaves. ,12000000
ABEL is left standing on top of the truck in the parking lot alone with his battered truck. ,44400
He looks down at the open loading valve and begins to come up with an idea. ,658000
The sun is setting. ,1290000
EXT. STANDARD HEATING TRUCK YARD - DAY A sign on the inside of the gate reads. "It's not safety first... ,1180000
It's safety always". ,97900000
The motor on the gate starts in and it opens. ,282000
In drives ABEL'S car. ,276000
INT. ANNA'S OFFICE STANDARD HEATING OIL - DAY ANNA is working away on an adding machine in her office. ,114000
She is listening to the radio that sits behind her on the desk. ,200000
We can see that she is in her comfort zone. ,16700000
INT. BROOKLYN ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - DAY The ASSISTANT D.A. is sitting behind his desk as DEPUTY LANGE stands off to the side. ,946
He is only in his early thirties but with confidence and ego to spare. ,132000
They know each other. ,9310000
A.D.A. ,8600000
LAWRENCE Andrew. 17 ANDREW WALSH Lawrence. ,3750000
Thank you for seeing us on such short notice. ,3050000
A.D.A. ,8610000
LAWRENCE Of course. ,11600000
And Mr. Morales. ,3270
Please sit. ,215000
I didn't realize you were coming as well. ,328000
ANDREW WALSH Yes... ,72100
A.D.A. ,8610000
LAWRENCE So what can I do for you? ,93000000
ANDREW WALSH We need your help. ,90400000
A.D.A. ,8600000
LAWRENCE In what way? ,16
ANDREW WALSH Our trucks. ,313000
They are being robbed. ,2120000
A.D.A. ,8610000
ANDREW looks around. ,13900000
He's getting paranoid. ,747000
ANDREW WALSH Do you want to go for a walk? ,76100
ABEL Are you really serious with this, this is what it's come to, walking around outside like fucking gangsters? ,22100
ANDREW WALSH I am and it is. 55 EXT. STANDARD HEATING OIL TRUCK - DAY Throughout this conversation ABEL is walking over to a section of the yard where WORKERS are loading some sort of additive chemical to the fuel trucks. ,7
ANDREW WALSH It is looking like we must do this. ,80600000
ABEL I must? ,10600000
This gets a little personal. ,65000
ANDREW WALSH They will shut you down. ,313000
ABEL These men, they work for me. ,21300000
These trucks they drive, the customers they serve. ,5280000
They are here because we built this. ,76700000
ANDREW WALSH That's true, until its not. ,7310000
And the last person in the world right now that we need working against us is the president of the fucking teamsters. ,127000
This company is out of business in a month if he gets these guys to walk. ,33100
We are running out of cash. ,752000
ABEL What are you even talking about here? ,3560000
ANDREW WALSH The union provides a handgun and a permit to every one of the drivers. ,21400
And they think this whole thing is over in a week. ,981000
ABEL These men are fucking truck drivers. ,123000
This is insane. ,10700000
You know who is gonna get it in the end here, me. ,27000000
This comes back to me. ,19700000
ANDREW WALSH It does either way. ,48800
ABEL I'm not doing it. 56 ANDREW WALSH Would you put everything at risk to stand by that. ,2370
ABEL thinks this through. ,15000000
ABEL It will be the end of everything I have worked for. ,148000
If one of these guys shoots somebody it's me they will bring down for it...I'll talk to him... ,838000
And we need to close this deal. ,31700000
We can't stay like this any longer. ,133000000
We must close on that property... ,78900000
We are so weak right now. ,1910000
They are now standing on top of one of the trucks tanks as a worker pours the additive into the tank. ,16700
The container says "GREEN DYE #7" on it. ,4990000
ABEL looks down as it flows in. ,1320000
He stands up and looks out across the fence at the container property. ,77300
ANDREW WALSH Why do you want this so badly? ,88600
ABEL Because I have my entire savings at risk with this deposit. ,1880000
It is everything. ,2760000
ANDREW WALSH That's not what I mean. ,70900
Why did you want it so badly in the first place? ,69500000
It was a risk... always. ,1410000
ABEL thinks this through. ,15100000
ABEL I don't know. ,9240000
ANDREW WALSH You don't know? ,88600000
Have you ever thought about it? ,7750000
ABEL I've thought about it every day for the last five years. ,3010000
This place was sitting over that fence mocking.... ,972000
ANDREW WALSH I didn't mean have you ever thought about that place... (MORE) 57 ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D) I mean have you ever thought why you want it so badly? ,1380
ABEL I don't know what you mean. ,123000000
ABEL looks to him in a sincere way wanting him to answer but ANDREW just waits. ,110000
Finally. ,16000000
ABEL (CONT'D) I know what you are asking and no... ,59700
I never ask myself why I do this. ,77700000
It just feels right... wanting to be bigger feels better. ,53100
It feels right. ,11900000
ANDREW WALSH That's very simple. ,69200
ABEL Yes... ,5040
With this he gives him a deadly serious look. ,143000
ABEL (CONT'D) ...It is. ,14900000
ANDREW WALSH You take these risks... ,325000
ABEL Only when necessary. ,492000
ANDREW WALSH We have to get going, we need them to show up. ,1390000
INT. WHITE TABLECLOTH RESTAURANT - NIGHT ANNA leads the boys to the table, and we see a whole new side to her. ,47900
She is going to get this done. ,15000000
As they approach the table we see two BANKERS stand to greet them. ,591000
The Bank President, ARTHUR LEWIS, and Bank VP IAN THOMPSON. ANNA Arthur. ,201000
ARTHUR LEWIS Anna, you look amazing as always. ,197000
ANNA Thank you. 58 ARTHUR LEWIS Gentlemen. ,428000
Do you know Ian Thompson? ,4230000
One of our new VP's. ,26200000
ANNA Ian. ,4510
They all shake hands and sit. ,855000
The WAITER comes over. ,49200
WAITER So what can I get you to drink? ,133000000
ABEL A lot. ,10200000
Awkward laughter. ,7130
ABEL (CONT'D) A wine list please. ,297000
WAITER I'll be right back. ,756000
ARTHUR LEWIS So how are you? ,28100000
ABEL We've been better... but we are good. ,3820000
ARTHUR LEWIS Yes I heard about that... if you stay in business long enough it's bound to happen eventually. ,32300
ANNA Well that's exactly right. ,1530000
And we wanted to sit down with you tonight to make sure we were being totally up-front with everything that is going on and make sure that you understand the nature of the complaints and are comfortable that it is not going to affect our business in an adverse way. ,2700
ANDREW WALSH Did you have a chance to look over the outline that I sent over? ,140000
ARTHUR LEWIS Yes, we did. 59 ANNA Hopefully it made clear that even in a worst case situation we will pay off any and all fines and be able to move forward with very comfortable capital on hand. ,45700
ABEL jumps in taking some offense. ,158000
ABEL But you should know Arthur that this man has been digging through our industry for over two years looking for anything he can find. ,1670000
And as you know probably better than anyone, having worked with some of our competitors the thought that he would have singled us out is ridiculous. ,3930
It reeks of everything that is wrong with this city right now. ,28800
We run a fair and clean business and follow every standard industry practice and I will fight `til my last day to prove that... ,44600
This silences the table for a long beat. ,754000
ABEL (CONT'D) But... but... ,138000
ABEL holds up his finger and points at ARTHUR across the table to make his point. ,260000
ABEL (CONT'D) ...Don't think for a moment that I am going to allow this mess to interfere with our plan to grow. ,27500
We need to know you are standing by us. ,104000000
BANK VP IAN THOMPSON Yes, what is it with this piece of property that you find so integral or that can't be put off `til after this legal matter is dealt with? ,66
ABEL is a little taken aback by this comment. ,259000
It goes against everything that comes naturally to him as a person. ,151000
ANNA and ANDREW know this and are concerned he might go off. ,130000
ABEL thinks it through. 60 ABEL That's a very good question. ,231000
This property gives us many things... firstly direct access to the river. ,318000
So I can bring in fuel directly from any provider in the world straight to my tanks, then it has over 10 million gallons of storage capacity, so I can buy in the summers when my price is low and sell to my customers and most importantly some of my competitors when the price is high. ,3130
I won't just drive trucks anymore... ,1650000
I will control my fate... but the real answer to your question... ,102000
Now ABEL stares right at IAN THOMPSON. ABEL (CONT'D) ... is that when it feels scary to jump Ian... that is exactly when you must jump... or you risk ending up staying in the same place your whole life... and that I can't do. ,54
IAN THOMPSON awkwardly laughs a bit as ABEL just stays deadly serious staring right at him. ,46
Finally. ,16000000
ARTHUR LEWIS We've always been there with you and know that we will continue to be. ,454000
INT. ABEL'S CAR - NIGHT ABEL is driving, and ANNA sits in silence looking out the passenger window. ,49300
They are heading along the main backwoods road to their house. ,140000
ANNA Well, that went about as well as could be expected. ,48800000
ABEL Yes. ,5040
Arthur is a good man. ,173000
ANNA Do you think they will close? ,66500000
ABEL Of course. 61 Just as he says this a deer comes running out in front of them. ,35000
ABEL tries to slam on the brakes but isn't able to stop in time. ,122000
The car hits the deer and it careens over the windshield and on to the road behind the car. ,317000
He continues to slam on the brakes and comes to a complete stop. ,6740000
They both catch their breath and look around to make sure they are both okay. ,300000
Then they look back at the deer. ,11300000
It is laying on the road but is still breathing. ,262000
ABEL (CONT'D) Are you okay? ,104000
ANNA Yes... you need to go put it out of its misery. ,3700000
ABEL Jesus. ,12200
ANNA I mean it. ,10400000
We can't just leave it here. ,10
EXT. BACKWOODS ROAD - NIGHT ABEL gets out of the car and looks at his smashed hood. ,20
He then walks back and approaches the animal. ,3620000
It is laying on the side of the road. ,42800
He comes right up to it and stares into its eyes. ,487000
It stares back at him. ,5350000
ABEL walks back to the car. ,164000
ANNA Is it dead? ,14300000
ABEL No. ANNA Well you need... ,172000
ABEL I know. ,14500000
He reaches down to open the trunk. ,55700
ANNA What are you doing? 62 ABEL Getting the tire iron! This whole situation has stressed them out and they are on edge. ,23900
ABEL goes to the trunk and gets out the large wrench. ,108000
He walks back over to the deer. ,832000
He bends down next to it and stares into its eye again. ,71000
ABEL is thinking back on something, or many things. ,11400000
He makes a small starting movement like he is going to hit it over the head but he stops himself. ,593000
He can't quite do it. ,284000
Then he sits with the animal a beat longer. ,679000
We come in very close to ABEL and see his hand is struggling to deliver the blow. ,2750000
Just as he grips the tire iron waiting... ,5040000
BANG! BANG! Two very loud GUNSHOTS go off from right over his shoulder. ,111000
He ducks for cover then slowly turns behind him. ,1250000
ANNA stands there holding a small-yet-powerful Saturday Night Special- style handgun. ,163000
Smoke is still rising from the end of the pistol. ,138000
The deer is dead. ,4150000
He looks at her dumbfounded... where did she get this gun? ,503000
She gives him a look. ,542000
Then turns and walks back to the car. ,1060000
He stays and struggles to get the deer out of the road. ,37300000
INT. ABEL'S DAMAGED CAR - NIGHT ANNA is sitting in the car waiting. ,83100
We hear ABEL'S footsteps as he approaches the open driver's side door. ,32700
He gets in without saying a word. ,4020000
We stay with them as they drive on in silence. ,34200000
INT. MORALES HOUSE, FRONT HALLWAY - NIGHT The door opens and ABEL walks in. ,76200
ANNA is already in the house talking with NANNY MARIA who's been baby-sitting. ,10900000
ANNA Hello Maria, sorry we are a bit late. ,2110000
They were fine? ,190000
NANNY MARIA Oh yes. ,55900
All is good. ,28400000
ANNA Great, thank you. ,37000
We'll see you in the morning then. 63 NANNY MARIA Okay. ,166000
NANNY MARIA comes around the corner and passes ABEL who is just standing in the living room. ,26800
He only gives her a nod. ,340000
ANNA is standing on the other side of the room just waiting in silence as well. ,1940000
NANNY MARIA goes over to the closet and gets her coat out and puts it on. ,989000
The tension is building like a kettle. ,84000
Finally NANNY MARIA gets herself together and walks out and as the door shuts they come immediately at each other. ,16000
ANNA What? ,67000
ABEL What? ,10200
ANNA Yes... what? ,83100
ABEL Are you kidding? ,2810000
ANNA No. ABEL Okay then... what is this gun? ,1880000
ANNA I told you I wasn't going to just continue to stand around and let these people come and get me and my children. ,1790000
So unlike you who seems to be totally comfortable just standing around like some... fucking pussy... ,4740
I did something about it. ,4820000
ABEL is slightly stammering at this point, not quite sure what to do. ,154000
They are still standing on opposite sides of the room from each other. ,2510000
He just waits... finally. ,1810000
ABEL Where did you get it? ,143000000
ANNA You know where I got it. ,56100
ABEL Do you have a permit? 64 ANNA Not yet. ,462000
This sets him off. ,14100000
He comes walking across the room at her as if he might hit her. ,912000
He gets closer and closer. ,4240000
ABEL You must be a bigger fucking idiot than I even thought. ,767000
You are trying to protect your children? ,1180000
Protect them? ,1340000
Do you have any idea what happens if you get caught using that thing? ,41200000
He is now standing right over her. ,212000
ABEL (CONT'D) You dress yourself up in these fancy clothes, and look at you here in your mansion. ,8580
I've given you everything you could possibly want but you still can't stop thinking like the Brooklyn corner-store gangster's daughter that you are. ,552000
ANNA You've given me? ,77600
Are you delusional? ,14300
Do you even understand how ridiculous that makes you sound? ,1010000
They are really going at it now. ,73100000
LAWRENCE (he looks over at DEPUTY LANGE) ANDREW WALSH We have a serious security issue. ,978
DEPUTY LANGE There have been a series of hijackings of bulk-fuel delivery vehicles. ,37100
LAWRENCE Yes. ,12500
ANDREW WALSH Our drivers are being put in danger. ,89500
LAWRENCE Mr. Walsh, as I know you know, this office has been investigating your entire industry. ,11400
There is an awkward pause as LAWRENCE decides how he should continue. 18 A.D.A. ,10300
LAWRENCE And as much as I'd like to be able to help you, you know this is a police issue. ,1700000
It's not what we do here. ,113000000
ANDREW WALSH I understand. ,71200
But this is turning into an urgent and pressing matter for us. ,988000
LAWRENCE Urgent? ,8100
ANDREW WALSH Yes. ,71300
LAWRENCE I'm not sure what you mean. ,3090000
There were more murders and rapes in this city last year then there ever have been, so if you have come to tell me that we have a urgent security issue here, trust me I'm aware. ,43200
ABEL cuts in. ,293000
He can't help himself. ,81700000
ABEL My people are at risk just driving around in this city, just trying to do their jobs. ,510000
And I... ,18400000
I have done everything you have asked of me. ,101000000
It's been two years since you first started investigating my company and I have spent thousands of dollars hiring lawyers for this and that to provide you with every piece of information your office has requested. ,32300
And I expect that you have been asking the same from my competitors. ,949000
So with all this information that you have gained... ,106000000
We are just asking if you have any idea who has been doing this to us? ,3150000
LAWRENCE I don't. ,99800000
This sits unanswered. 19 A.D.A. ,10500000
LAWRENCE (CONT'D) I understand your frustration. ,37100
And although everyone else seems to have given up and left this city for dead, I haven't. ,371000
And as you know we have been investigating industry-wide corruption in your business that seems to have been going on for years. ,450000
And the simple fact is that the only person who could do anything with 8000 gallons of heating oil in a matter of minutes after stealing a truck is someone from within that industry. ,1050
And almost certainly someone with local storage capacity. ,823000
So you're right. ,442000
That means you all are stealing from each other. ,9530000
Which is, as far as I can tell, just a refreshing new take on what you've been doing to your customers and fellow taxpayers for the last fifteen years. ,6520
This sits in the room for a long beat. ,4160000
ABEL First, please know that we respect the work you are doing to try to help our business and the city. ,7210000
But also know I have never taken anything I haven't earned from anyone so when you say you've... ,2080000
He pulls himself back. ,1530000
ABEL (CONT'D) We are on the same side here. ,150000
LAWRENCE Well yes and no. ,27900000
See, all that I can do is to try and put people away in the simplest and most economical way possible with the limited resources at my disposal. ,22100
It doesn't really matter to us who it is or how we do it as long as it's progress. ,5240000
ABEL Well, it makes a difference to me. 20 A.D.A. ,52900000
LAWRENCE I know it does. ,43600000
This city is a very difficult place to do business right now. ,51500000
This more conciliatory tone makes LAWRENCE think through his next reply for a long beat. ,1350000
LAWRENCE You know... ,147000000
Mr. Morales you seem like a decent man, and because of that I'm really not comfortable just sitting here with you pretending that the elephant perched on the corner of my desk isn't there. ,71
LAWRENCE looks over at DEPUTY LANGE whose body language says `don't go down this road'. ,17300
But he does. ,2320000
LAWRENCE (CONT'D) I can't go into specifics at this moment but we believe that you and your company have broken the law and that we have enough evidence to prove that. ,19100
So next week, Monday actually, we will be bringing a case against you. ,1320000
This drops like a bomb. ,2940000
ABEL and LAWRENCE stare at each other. ,28400
Then ABEL glances to the corner of the desk. ,12200
We see that a large draft copy of the case is actually sitting there. ,2330000
ABEL looks back up. ,196000
LAWRENCE (CONT'D) I'm sorry to do this in person. ,28800
It's awkward, obviously, but I didn't want to have this happen on Monday not having said something here in person today, out of respect. ,274000
ABEL stands up to leave and ANDREW is still a little stunned but stands. 21 ABEL (CONT'D) You have your job to do. ,21800
But know that you are wrong and that we will take advantage of every opportunity to prove that. ,3520000
LAWRENCE I'm sure you will. ,4320000
They turn to leave. ,3870000
And LAWRENCE has one more thought. ,5
LAWRENCE (CONT'D) One more thing... ,1060000
Have you been doing anything different in your business over the last year? ,1280000
LAWRENCE I'm just looking here through these reports. ,52400000
It looks like out of the nineteen registered heating oil companies in the city your trucks have been getting hit three to one. ,165000
ABEL Yes? ,5040
LAWRENCE So are you maybe doing something to bring this on yourself? ,898000
ANDREW WALSH Like what? ,71300
LAWRENCE Like enter a new market? ,56200000
ABEL I am always trying to expand my business. ,19600000
But I think you understand what I'm saying... there are always some markets that are more difficult than others to enter. ,33100
ABEL Every new market is a difficult market. (MORE) 22 ABEL (CONT'D) But my driver was assaulted and my truck and oil were stolen in broad daylight in front of fifteen toll collectors and six police officers yesterday. ,86
And yet no one saw anything. ,73900
That is a problem... no? ,17800000
LAWRENCE I have a lot of problems coming across my desk every day Mr. Morales. ,782000
ABEL I'm sure you do. ,3000000
INT. HALLWAY OF BROOKLYN D.A. ,75300
COURT BUILDING - DAY ABEL walks out in front of ANDREW. ANDREW WALSH Abel. ,73300
Abel. ,14200000
He stops and turns. ,2190000
ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D) (his words escape him) ABEL Exactly. ,699
ANDREW WALSH No... let's not overreact. ,144000
We don't even know what they are bringing against us. ,38700000
It could be total bullshit, and they are just trying to use us along the way. ,2680000
This isn't anything yet. ,19
ABEL enters. ,1450
ANNA How'd it go? 23 ABEL The DA... ,270000
He said he's going to bring down charges on us next week. ,2200000
ANNA For what? ,14200000
ABEL We don't know yet. ,58800000
ANNA Who else? ,14100000
ABEL Right now they are just saying us. ,4150000
ABEL (CONT'D) Where are we exposed? ,46200
ANNA We follow standard industry practice on every front. ,4610000
ABEL Anna? ,5510
ANNA I need to know what they are saying we did. ,6010000
ABEL Okay. ,766
INT. HOSPITAL LONG HALLWAY - DAY ABEL walks down the long hallway and enters a room. ,26000
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY JULIAN is sitting on the edge of the bed, waiting. ,436000
His jaw is in bandages, and there are crutches sitting next to him, but he looks much better than the previous day. ,88600
They look at each other intensely but say nothing. 24 INT. SHIT-HOLE TENEMENT STAIRWELL - DAY ABEL is helping JULIAN up the stairs. ,83
They struggle together. ,5770
Finally they get to the top floor and stand outside apartment number . ,2700000
JULIAN stops, not really wanting to open the door in front of his boss. ,60800
ABEL I'm very sorry this happened. ,90800
Do you need anything else? (JULIAN nods no) If you do, you call the office... ,131000
Okay then. ,315000
He turns to leave and walks back to the stairs. ,2300000
JULIAN Abel? ,4620
ABEL turns and looks at him. ,38400
JULIAN (CONT'D) Do you think I am ready to move into sales? ,41900
ABEL I don't. ,99900000
JULIAN I... ,307000
I'm not sure I will be able... ,44200
ABEL You will. ,31700000
JULIAN changes the subject. ,2340000
JULIAN Did you get the truck back? ,17800000
They took the load. ,19
JULIAN This is the sixth one? ,7530000
ABEL Seventh... you get some rest. 25 EXT. BUILDING BY ABEL'S CAR - DAY ABEL comes out of the building and walks towards his car where a group of TOUGH-LOOKING KIDS in their early twenties are sitting, looking to see who is going to come and claim the brand new car. ,580
He walks right though them without being overly aggressive but without a hint of being intimidated. ,242000
He gets in and drives away. ,45900
INT. BROOKLYN BARBERSHOP - NIGHT ABEL is sitting in the barber chair getting a trim. ,49600
Through the window we see ARNOLD KLINE, a competitor of ABEL'S walking by. ,11800
They see each other. ,32300000
ARNOLD KLINE comes into the shop followed by a BODYGUARD. He sits down next to ABEL. This conversation happens with them both looking at each other in the mirror. ,16500
ARNOLD KLINE Well, look who it is. ,252000
ABEL Arnold. ,6330
ARNOLD KLINE Just a touch off the side Jimmy. ,143000
Not all of us are as lucky as Mr. Morales here in terms of keeping our hair. ,131000
BARBER JIMMY You're a good looking man. ,3610000
ARNOLD KLINE I know I am. ,62700000
So I hear congratulations are in order? ,310000
ABEL What's that? ,6610000
ARNOLD KLINE You got yourself in contract over there. ,155000
ABEL We are working on it. ,72900000
ARNOLD KLINE Thirty day close I hear, you better be. ,1190000
ABEL We are, thanks for your concern. 26 BARBER JIMMY finishes ABEL, and he stands up to leave. ,57400
ABEL has his back to KLINE as he pays. ,3740000
ARNOLD KLINE I saw a couple of your trucks over in Rego Park the other day. ,48800
This brings ABEL around to look at him square. ,3170000
When was that? ,3620000
ARNOLD KLINE A couple times. ,200000
ABEL It's possible. ,16
ARNOLD KLINE Is it? ,200000
ARNOLD KLINE That's a tough market. ,30300
ARNOLD KLINE My father struggled for years before he broke in there. ,128000
ABEL Any new market is a tough one. ,5090000
I'll see you. ,9930000
ABEL walks out of the shop and looks around. ,224000
It is now dark outside. ,8240000
EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NEXT MORNING ABEL is jogging again but this time he is deep in the woods. ,23800
He runs along the road. ,4770000
We then hear a car coming from behind him. ,55900
The car noise then turns into more of a truck noise. ,2970000
He stops and turns around as we see a large truck coming towards him. ,3140000
He gets himself over to the side of the road. ,78700000
We have a slight fear it might hit him. ,150000
But as it passes we see it's a large moving truck. ,49800000
There's a second one following right behind it. 27 As the trucks pass it registers on ABEL's face. ,12000
He cuts into a path in the woods. ,2110000
EXT. DRIVEWAY ABEL walks up to his house, and we see the moving trucks preparing to unload. ,13500
ANNA gets out of her car with the kids, and they run around and check out the house as ANNA directs the movers. ,245000
ABEL comes up and stands next to her. ,64900
They smile a protected smile at their new home. ,52100000
ABEL gives her a kiss. ,740000
INT. DINING ROOM OF NEW HOUSE - NIGHT The whole family sits around the table in candlelight. ,84300
They are eating takeout, but with a mismatch of formal and everyday tableware that has been unpacked. ,11600
There are boxes all around them. ,235000
ANNA I know it has been a long road, and that not all of you wanted to do this, but thank you. ,3490000
For me... ,16100000
ABEL A toast. ,10100000
All six raise a glass. ,3830000
ABEL (CONT'D) A toast to our new home. ,69900
It's as beautiful as my wife and daughters and as strong as me...(kids laugh) May we be happy, prosperous and safe here. ,49600
Cheers. ,13600000
INT. GYMNASIUM GIRLS YOUTH SOCCER GAME - NEXT MORNING ABEL is standing watching the game as he waits for his coffee to come out of the snack bar. ,31900
Over his shoulder we hear... ,178000
PETER FORENTE So you made the move? ,343000
ABEL turns and sees PETER FORENTE standing there. ,49900
He's in his mid-forties, very well-dressed, and handsomely bald. ,33300
ABEL Peter... it's official as of yesterday. 28 COUNTER PERSON Sir. ,202000
ABEL picks up his coffee, and they both walk back over to the sideline together. ,9750
Although they are standing a bit off to the side from everyone else. ,40800
PETER FORENTE So I heard about your rig getting picked off again. ,394000
PETER FORENTE We should probably get together to discuss this and go over some of the preventative measures that we've been taking. ,271000
We haven't had an incident since November. ,5280000
It doesn't do any of us any good to have this kind of attention brought to us. ,10700000
They both stare out at the court for beat. ,37100000
PETER FORENTE (CONT'D) So I think I may have seen one of your new trucks the other day. ,43000
PETER FORENTE (CONT'D) Out near here, at the Miller Road diner? ,25700
ABEL That's possible. ,6690000
PETER FORENTE The driver looked like a member of the Hitler Youth. ,111000
I haven't seen a teamster that blond and blue-eyed since I was a kid. ,42000
ABEL He's from Ohio. ,357000
Played football. ,601000
I like my drivers to fit in with the neighborhood... ,8060000
PETER FORENTE That's new territory for you, no? ,145000000
This brings them both back in to look at each other. 29 ABEL Just picked up a few new accounts over there. ,117000
Weekend houses of some old clients from in the city. ,51900000
PETER gives a bit of a stronger look. ,305000
Then finally turns back towards the field. ,3010000
PETER FORENTE Which one is yours? ,21500
ABEL Right there. ,140000
They look out. ,14400000
PETER FORENTE She's beautiful. ,12500
PETER FORENTE Welcome to the neighborhood. ,3250000
You should be proud. ,148000000
ABEL Proud? ,530
PETER FORENTE Yes. ,21500
INT. GARAGE OF THE NEW HOUSE - DAY The garage is filled with boxes. ,3290000
ABEL stands in the middle of a few that are partially unpacked. ,26200
He has set up an old radio in the corner of the garage, and it is playing a New York Giants football game. ,251000
ABEL takes an object out of one of the boxes and looks at it with significance. ,460000
Coming from the main house we hear the doorbell ring. ,5280000
ABEL'S oldest daughter, ANNIE, comes to the door of the garage. ,105000
ANNIE Dad. ,2570
Mr. Walsh is here. ,98000
ABEL looks around behind ANNIE to see ANDREW standing there. ,256000
He waves him into the garage. ,305000
The boxes are stacked almost to the ceiling around them. 30 ANDREW WALSH I'm sorry for the dramatic drop in but your phone doesn't seem to be working. ,72200
ABEL It's not set up yet... ,109000000
So I am guessing this isn't good news here on a Sunday night. ,2250000
ANDREW WALSH No... ,71300
It looks like they are coming after us. ,645000
ABEL That describes many people at this point. ,4280000
Slight smile. ,93700
ANDREW WALSH The D.A. ,76100
ABEL How bad? ,7
ANDREW WALSH I still haven't seen it yet. ,268000
But my guy in his office just gave me a heads up an hour ago. ,1220000
It's not good. ,26000000
ABEL Where are we exposed? ,3800000
ANDREW WALSH I'm not sure, a couple places probably. ,3740000
ABEL A couple places? ,678000
This hits ABEL. He thinks for a beat than goes over to the door to the house and calls for his wife. ,432000
ABEL (CONT'D) Anna... ,40500
Anna! They wait. ,7160000
She enters, she is a bit surprised to see ANDREW in her garage. ,53600
ANNA Andrew. 31 ANDREW WALSH Anna... sorry you've got no phone. ,278000
ABEL As of tomorrow I'll have my new radio hooked up though so you should be able to reach me wherever I am... ,61700
He is making light of the situation, but as she looks at their faces she knows there is a problem. ,2890000
ANDREW WALSH The D.A. is going to bring down charges on us tomorrow. ,76600
ANNA For what? ,11000000
ANDREW WALSH We don't know yet. ,84200000
ANNA Who else? ,14100000
ANDREW WALSH Right now they are just saying us. ,92400
ABEL Where are we exposed? ,3830000
ABEL looks at his wife. ,820000
She looks at ANDREW. ANNA We follow standard industry practice on every front. ,4610000
They all give each other a long look, as this means they have been bending the rules in several places, as do all their competitors. ,1630000
ABEL What does that mean? ,3830000
ANNA You know what that means. ,66500000
ANDREW WALSH It means we may have some accounting exposure where we have pushed things a little too far. ,9480
ABEL How far? 32 ANDREW WALSH You always told us to push until we couldn't push any further. ,1650
Well, we may have hit that line. ,21800000
So we will handle it and move on. ,1390000
ABEL Anna? ,5510
ABEL shoots her a stinging worried glance. ,20900
ANNA I need to know what they are saying we did. ,6020000
ANDREW WALSH Let's not get ahead of ourselves here. ,334000
You have always followed standard industry practices. ,219000
We aren't even sure what this is yet. ,187000
I just wanted to make sure you had all the information I do. ,6520000
This is a badge of honor, it means we are big enough to give a shit about now. ,535000
Don't worry. ,7090000
That sits for a beat. ,13600000
ABEL Okay. ,766
ANNA Thank you for coming by Andrew. ,1890000
ABEL reaches into his pocket and takes out a remote for the automatic garage door opener. ,52100
As it opens you can see the pride in his face as this remote is a fairly high-tech new item. ,106000
They all sit and watch as it opens the whole way then stops in silence. ,1200000
ANDREW is now standing outside in the driveway. ,1710000
ANDREW WALSH Very impressive. ,31400
ANNA It only cost him a year of the kid's tuition. 33 ANDREW WALSH And one more thing. ,134000
I got a call from the union... ,5970000
O'Leary. ,4890000
This grabs both their attention. ,603000
ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D) They've been getting word back from our drivers. ,8590
ANNA What word? ,16800000
ANDREW WALSH There is real concern about their safety. ,49600
ABEL Who? ,25500
ANNA All of them. ,67600000
ANDREW WALSH The drivers are feeling unprotected. ,24900
ANNA Because they are. ,10100000
ANDREW WALSH I just think you should talk to them about it. ,116000
Before it grows into something. ,200000
ABEL Okay. ,766
ANDREW WALSH Good night. ,249000
INT. ABEL AND ANNA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT ABEL is lying in bed, awake. ,11100
ANNA is as well. ,14000000
He is staring at the ceiling. ,177000
Their dog is lying at the foot of the bed asleep as well. ,1890000
Eventually the dog wakes up and looks out towards the doorway. ,162000
He growls ever so lightly. ,56500
Then he stops, listens, and starts growling a little more. ,52400
ANNA looks up ever so slightly. ,373000
ANNA What's he doing? 34 ABEL is now standing up to go look. ,235000
ABEL Quiet... don't worry. ,117000
ANNA tries to go back to sleep. ,921000
INT. HALLWAYS/KID'S ROOMS - NIGHT ABEL walks out of the bedroom and slowly heads down the hall to his kids' rooms. ,25600
He looks in each room and the CHILD is sleeping soundly with nothing out of place. ,9120000
INT. KIDS' ROOMS/HALLWAY- SAME TIME As he comes out of the last bedroom back into the hallway he sees his dog standing at the top of the stairs looking down over the balcony into the living room. ,7020
The dog is starting to quietly growl once again. ,134000
ABEL'S face goes from total comfort that his kids are safe to total paranoia. ,39400
He slowly walks down the hall. ,2600000
He stops off in his bedroom closet and grabs a mid-size baseball bat/billy club. ,361000
Now he is heading down the stairs with the club trying not to freak himself out. ,82400
INT. OPEN LIVING ROOM/ENTRY HALL/FRONT DOOR - NIGHT ABEL walks down the stairs and the dog just stands at the top, still growling every now and then. ,24100
ABEL comes into the living room and everything seems perfectly normal. ,83900
He then relaxes and turns towards the dog. ,1070000
ABEL Quiet. ,810
Come down here. ,83700000
He snaps his fingers and calls the dog. ,613000
The dog finally comes down the stairs. ,3250000
ABEL now heads towards the kitchen in a relaxed state, but then the dog starts growling again and looking out the windows next to the front door. ,14900
ABEL comes over, he opens the front door but the dog refuses to go out. ,14900
ABEL (CONT'D) Go. Oh come on. ,1220000
Go. ABEL thinks he hears something. ,1610000
He clicks on the lights and pulls his bat back up into position. ,343000
He heads outside. 35 EXT. FRONT DOOR TO ABEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT ABEL comes to the end of the front walk and there is nothing. ,13400
The dog has now followed him outside and is slowly heading over to a area where a small exterior hallway leads to a side entrance. ,12800
It is dark. ,13200000
The dog starts barking and going crazy. ,587000
ABEL slowly heads over to the covered passageway. ,643000
All hell now breaks lose. ,77900000
A BURGLAR, in all black, comes blasting out of the shadows. ,55600
The dog tries to bite him as he goes by. ,361000
ABEL swings his club and hits BURGLAR square on the shoulder but he keeps coming. ,14000
He knocks ABEL over and runs towards the driveway. ,163000
ABEL is up and chasing after him faster than we expect. ,120000
EXT. BASE OF THE RAVINE DEEP IN WOODS- CONTINUOUS There is a pretty good moon out so we can see them running full throttle through the very thick woods. ,6330
ABEL is keeping up with him and in fact may be gaining on him. ,9270000
ABEL is still in his pajamas. ,88300
He has a rage that has been building up inside him for a good two weeks that is now pouring out of him in the energy to chase this guy down. ,46100
They come to the top of a small ravine which ABEL seems to know from his runs through the woods and ABEL takes a bit of an easier/quicker path down. ,3850
EXT. WOODS BEHIND ABEL'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ABEL now cuts him off at an angle and swings the bat at his legs. ,27700
BURGLAR trips and goes flying. ,2940000
ABEL falls as he swings at him. ,233000
They both sit on the ground for a beat. ,155000
ABEL is exhausted. ,10800000
A brief look of panic comes across BURGLAR's face. ,122000
Then he is up again and running off into the woods. ,870000
ABEL gets himself up and chases after him. ,103000
EXT. ROAD NEXT TO THE WOODS - NIGHT ABEL comes out of the woods into the middle of the road, and in the distance we see BURGLAR run up to a waiting van with its lights and engine on. ,29
The guy gets into the passenger side of the van, and it peels out. ,126000
ABEL is left standing in the middle of the road, barely able to breathe and holding the bat. 36 EXT. ABEL FRONT DOOR - NIGHT ABEL comes walking back towards his front door. ,2570
ANNA is standing with all the lights on and with the dog sitting next to her. ,909000
She looks at him in shock. ,4120000
ANNA Where were you? ,140000000
ABEL (looking to the dog) A lot of help you were. ,61500000
ANNA Abel? ,6910
They both look down at his bare feet. ,324000
He has been in some kind of shock and hasn't even noticed that his bare feet are cut up to pieces from running in the woods through the ice. ,37900
His feet are bleeding all over the walkway. ,68100
INT. POWDER ROOM OF ABEL AND ANNA'S HOUSE - NIGHT ANNA is in warrior mode. ,147000
Any panic in her voice has disappeared, and she is speaking with a calm yet deadly seriousness. ,162000
She is cleaning the cuts on his feet and putting bandages on them as they talk. ,144000
ANNA Who was it? ,14200000
ABEL What do you mean, how am I supposed to know who it was? ,3790000
ABEL (CONT'D) I don't know. ,3830000
She gives him another look. ,11000000
ABEL (CONT'D) I think it was just some punk, looking to rip us off. ,28200
ANNA If you... ,31600000
ABEL Ouch! If they had wanted to send a message he could have... and he didn't. 37 ANNA Seems like a message was sent loud and clear. ,25600
ABEL Please. ,5890
Don't get going on this. ,29600000
We are a big new house. ,38900
He probably wanted the TV. He didn't have a gun, he had nothing. ,3230000
The alarm will be in on Monday. ,7200000
It was some kid. ,10500000
They aren't coming back. ,23700000
She looks at him with considerable concern. ,1680000
He leans in and starts kissing her. ,1250000
She holds still at first then gives in. ,40800000
INT. TRAINING ROOM AT STANDARD HEATING OIL - NEXT MORNING ABEL is in a suit but is kneeling and almost lying on his back showing three SALES RECRUITS what they should be looking for. ,483
Another INSTRUCTOR looks on. ,4480000
We see ABEL in his element. ,2410000
He is a salesman. ,13200000
ABEL What you are looking for here is the opening to the burn chamber. ,3510000
Now at this point you have not tipped your hat in anyway. ,36600000
From the minute you walked in the house you should have been working to create an impression of total impartiality. ,49000
But now... ,12700000
He reaches over and opens the small door. ,27400
A fire is burning inside. ,1250000
On cue the instructor hands ABEL a crisp clean white handkerchief. ,34400
ABEL (CONT'D) When this door opens you begin to close. ,56900
It must always be spotless. ,1020000
If they see you have ever done this before it is over. ,2210000
He takes it and reaches up into a small exhaust chimney. ,125000
ABEL (CONT'D) Now, you do this and only this... ,244000
You look down at the cloth and don't say a word... ,443000
You just keep staring at the cloth and then you slowly just start shaking your head. ,157000
Very very slowly and small. (MORE) 38 ABEL (CONT'D) Don't look up at them. ,3960
And whatever it is you always take the fancy option. ,28700000
INSTRUCTOR Can I get you a coffee or tea? ,84300000
ABEL A tea please. ,387000
INSTRUCTOR We have some homemade lemonade or a soda. ,2980000
ABEL I'd love a lemonade, thank you. ,62000
SALES STUDENT ALEX Why? ,97600
ABEL Because, we are never going to be the cheapest option, so we have to be the best. ,13100000
And they want... no, need... to feel that you want the best too. ,88100000
That's why our trucks are the newest or cleanest, and our drivers are approachable. ,541000
Just then the woman who works behind the front desk (STANDARD FRONT DESK) comes to the door. ,128000
STANDARD FRONT DESK They need you. 39 ABEL I gotta go, but the final point I will make is the hardest one. ,6950
Once you have done the math and shown them what we can save them over the long haul through proper maintenance, you need them to sign. ,50700
And the problem is by hiring you that means they are firing someone else. ,298000
And that's never easy. ,8600000
So to get them over the line you need to close them. ,2270000
So when you show them the number look up at them both... and just stare at them... ,3620000
ABEL begins staring at the recruits. ,12300
He continues to stare. ,6990000
ABEL (CONT'D) You stare longer than you should. ,45300
Because this is not a joke. ,84500000
You will only keep this job if you close. ,420000
And that's not funny to you. ,557000000
And I am only interested in this company growing, and when it isn't I don't think it's funny at all. ,1480000
These people work very hard for their money and these other guys are ripping them off, treating them poorly, because they don't know... so when you look them in the eye you have to believe that we are better, and we are, but you will never do anything as hard as staring a person straight in the eye and telling the truth. ,265000
ABEL then does exactly that to them. ,3830000
And he holds it for a long beat. ,434000
ABEL (CONT'D) Well... it was great to meet you. ,217000
Welcome and I wish you luck. ,99500
ABEL walks out of the room and straight into. ,109000
INT. LARGE STAFF MEETING ROOM - DAY There is a great high/low nature to the way ABEL runs the company. ,64600
While he wears great suits and his trucks are impeccable, he does not waste money. ,1340000
So this room where the drivers have company meetings is very basic. 40 The room is filled with all of the drivers. ,219000
There is a bit of a nervous energy in the room. ,101000
It quiets as ABEL comes in. ,636000
He stands aside. ,161000
STANDARD FRONT DESK Trucks 16 through 23 you should be ready to go... ,417000
As STANDARD FRONT DESK sees ABEL standing behind her, she stops. ,78300
ABEL walks forward a few steps. ,606000
ABEL Good morning. ,4020000
First off, I picked up Julian yesterday and he is back home and doing much better. ,647000
And I just wanted to make sure you are all aware that we are doing everything we can to deal with this situation. ,2250000
We are working with law enforcement, and they seem to be closing in on these guys. ,288000
But, sadly these are the times we are living in and we must rise above them. ,361000
So, on that front we have these. ,1800000
He puts one of the new radios on the dais. ,34300
ANDREW comes into the room behind ABEL and stands. ,122000
ABEL (CONT'D) These will be in every truck by the end of the week. ,19300
Much to my wife's concern I spent some serious coin and we now have our own closed channel that shouldn't have any blackout areas. ,16100
You will always be in contact with us. (a hand goes up in the BACK) Yes, Eddy. ,14700000
SENIOR DRIVER EDDY I have heard that the union is considering recommending other more active options for us to consider. ,74100
Do you know about this? ,2490000
ABEL looks to ANDREW. ABEL We have been in constant contact with the union and they aren't considering any new course of action at this time. 41 SENIOR DRIVER EDDY So this radio is what we got? ,62700
EXT. ABEL AND ANNA'S HOUSE - DAY ANNA is walking back from the mailbox looking through the day's mail. ,5960
As she approaches the house she looks up and sees the two younger daughters, ELIZABETH (6 years old) and CATHERINE (4 years old), playing in front of the house. ,10400
CATHERINE comes out from under a bush near the side door with something in her hand. ,156000
ANNA looks back down at the mail. ,611000
As she gets closer to the house we see a look of concern come across her face. ,1140000
The look then turns to one of complete horror but as she gets closer to CATHERINE she tries to control her emotions. ,32600
ANNA Catherine... ,66700
Catherine. ,16000000
Katie! She drops the mail. ,2180000
And goes right up to her daughter. ,452000
CATHERINE Mommy. ,5460
As ANNA comes up to CATHERINE we now see that the little girl is holding a large very real looking handgun in her little hands. ,20500
ANNA is besides herself. ,6400000
ANNA Where did you get this? ,141000000
Catherine where did you find this? ,6210000
CATHERINE Right here. ,1190000
The little girl points over towards the bushes near the side door where LOUIS SERVIDIO was hiding and got hit the night before. ,3280
ANNA Show me. ,14300000
The little girl walks over to bushes and kneels down. ,807000
CATHERINE It was just sitting right here. ,9500000
ANNA turns to the middle daughter, ELIZABETH. 42 ANNA Did you see this? ,430000
ELIZABETH Yeah, she went under there to get that ball and came out with it. ,5690000
ANNA Maria! ANNA yells towards in the house. ,31400
ELIZABETH What is it? ,113000
ANNA walks towards the front door to retrieve the NANNY MARIA. ANNA Maria! ELIZABETH Mom, is it real? ,120000
INT. ABEL'S OFFICE STANDARD HEATING OIL - DAY ABEL is sitting down at his desk. ,10900
ANNA comes to the door. ,64600
She gets his attention and then walks right up to the desk. ,1190000
She puts the handgun down right in front of him. ,3210000
ABEL What is that? ,11000000
ANNA A gun... ,19300000
It's a gun Abel. ,72400000
ANNA Your youngest daughter found it in the bushes outside our front door. ,56100
She was playing with it. ,4660000
ABEL is totally speechless. ,12400
ANNA (CONT'D) It's loaded... with the safety off. ,244000
This sits like a bomb in the room. 43 ANNA (CONT'D) Those weren't kids looking to rip off our TV Abel, that was a fucking goon with a loaded gun looking in our windows! What the hell is going on here? ,14900
ABEL Let me see that. ,3800000
I'll take care of this. ,1100000
ANNA Damn right we will. ,208000
Who is this? ,8170000
ABEL I don't know, but I will take care of it. ,62900000
ANNA What does that mean you will take care of it. ,9890000
This isn't a brick through our car window or some other cute little warning that I've put up with in the past. ,88600
This is your daughter playing with a loaded gun! He turns back quickly. ,672000
And stares at her. ,4740000
ABEL (YELLS) I know what it is! He slowly walks back across the room and picks up the gun. ,53100
His hand shows a shake ever so slightly as he touches it. ,75500
ABEL (CONT'D) Let me deal with this. ,205000
ANNA You better. ,101000000
Because you won't like what's going to happen once I start getting involved. ,2270000
This causes him to stop in his tracks. ,418000
He turns very seriously. ,1920000
ABEL You are not to tell your father about this. ,113000000
She looks back at him with a tinge of a smile. 44 ABEL (CONT'D) Do you hear me. ,22200
ANNA'S look changes and she understands. ,26800
ANNA ...I won't. ,61600000
ANDREW comes to the door and knocks. ,295000
ANDREW WALSH Can I talk with you both? ,65600
ANNA I found a gun outside our front door. ,12200000
Somebody left it there last night. ,762000
ANDREW WALSH Who? ,11500000
ANNA looks over to ANDREW letting him know her disgust. ,7670000
ANDREW WALSH Well... ,68200
He looks around then closes the door behind him and gets their attention. ,992000
ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D) It's not good... ,66900
It's bad He takes out a folder containing the formal indictment and hands it to ABEL. ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D) It's a fourteen count indictment. ,48400
Most of it is crap. ,8100000
Piggyback issues. ,13700
But... ,25400000
As ANDREW keeps talking, trucks go rumbling by behind them. ,112000
ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D) The first three counts are where we start to have real issues. ,59600
They know what's going on in this industry. ,2330000
They say we are rigging scales and under-reporting income. ,30100
We don't know what they have or how they got it. ,108000000
But no matter how they got it, it's a problem. 45 ABEL That truck just went out filthy. ,18000
ABEL looks out the window as a truck leaves the yard. ,573000
ANNA Abel! ANDREW WALSH We are going to owe them some money. ,77500
This brings him back. ,64
ABEL How much? ,10900000
ANDREW WALSH That depends on a bunch of factors. ,3770000
But that's an accounting question. ,1150000
They both look to ANNA ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D) And there is one other thing. ,292000
The bank... ,14100000
This hits ABEL. ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D) We need to sit down with them immediately. ,32700
I set a dinner. ,2630000
We need you both there to lay everything out and be totally up- front. ,4670000
This shouldn't be a problem. ,5559999
Lord knows they've given money to bigger crooks than us. ,59300
But I don't want us hiding anything from them. ,3890000
ABEL does not like this joke. ,1760000
ABEL You need to get home and start going through our set of books. ,7300000
How far back are they going? ,9230000
ANDREW WALSH Seems like all the way back to when you bought out Anna's father. ,170000
ANNA I'll get into it. 46 He looks out the window and sees a Cadillac pull in.. ,1630000
ABEL What is O'Leary doing here?. ,105000
Abel looks to ANDREW. ANDREW WALSH He's been wanting to talk to you for days. ,1040000
ABEL (under his breath) Jesus. ,128000
ABEL gets up to go out. ,3830000
As ANDREW shuffles to leave ANNA STOPS HIM: ANNA Andrew can I talk to you for a minute. ,97000
ABEL leaves and they stay. ,4110000
EXT. STANDARD HEATING OIL YARD - DAY ABEL How are you Bill? ,200000
BILL O'LEARY I'm ok. ,82700000
Can't say I'm used to making house calls like this anymore though. ,3090000
ABEL I would have come to see you. ,1370000
BILL O'LEARY That's alright. ,68900
You've got bigger things to worry about. (Long pause) So, I can't have this situation with your guys continuing. ,74100
ABEL My guys. ,83200
BILL O'LEARY Your drivers. 47 ABEL Good. ,86900
I would love you to help on this. ,54100000
Because I can't have it going on any longer either. ,4080000
BILL O'LEARY So let them protect themselves, that would stop all this very quickly. ,20900
ABEL I respectfully disagree. ,3100000
BILL O'LEARY They are picking on your men because they are just sitting there... weak. ,19900
ABEL They are taking shots at me because I am growing, expanding, getting stronger not weaker. ,28800
This frustrates Bill because he knows ABEL is right. ,50500
He tries a new tack. ,3580000
BILL O'LEARY It's quite simple for me: I can't have my drivers getting hit like this. ,2300000
It looks like I can't protect them. ,52500000
ABEL Well, it appears that you can't. ,559000
This is a little too sharp for the head of the NYC teamster's taste. ,77400
BILL O'LEARY I can. ,68900
And will. ,15700000
Because of all my job descriptions that is the one I consider most sacred. ,744000
ABEL I agree. ,10800000
But these are truck drivers, not soldiers, this will lead to chaos. ,116000
BILL O'LEARY It will stop immediately. ,301000
ABEL No, it won't. 48 He resets, again. ,210000
BILL O'LEARY You seem to be under pressure from many sides right now... which I understand. ,121000
Trust me I understand. ,21100000
So let me think this through. ,252000
But whatever decision I make on this, it stands. ,828000
Those men show up every morning for you because I tell them to. ,2460000
It's important for you to realize that these are very dangerous times, and we need to adapt. ,4930000
It's not like when we were driving. ,16900000
BILL O'LEARY Sometimes the weak man is the stronger man if he has the right tools. ,54600
ABEL It may seem that way... but if you are weak eventually it will show... it always does. ,758000
And if you want this to all be behind us, help me find out who is doing this. ,34700000
You know a lot of people, and that would be the most help to me. ,64000000
BILL O'LEARY It's not always as simple as it appears. ,7300000
BILL O'LEARY It is... well, I got to get going. ,76600000
ABEL Thank you for coming Bill. ,356000
EXT. GATE AT STANDARD HEATING OIL - DAY O'LEARY walks over to ANDREW as he is getting in his car. ,2950
ANDREW WALSH How did that go? 49 BILL O'LEARY Not well. ,142000
ANDREW WALSH He feels very strongly about this. ,68000
BILL O'LEARY I can see that. ,68800
ANDREW WALSH I don't think he fully understands it. ,19700
BILL O'LEARY What's to understand? ,81400000
ANDREW WALSH It's illegal. ,197000
BILL O'LEARY It's not illegal if I say it isn't. ,47400
My responsibility is to provide safe and timely passage of goods and products into and around this city. ,762000
And because of this situation it is appearing to those whose opinions I care about that I can't do my job. ,559000
That can not and will not continue. ,22600000
ANDREW WALSH I understand. ,68000
BILL O'LEARY So talk to him. ,314000
You need to protect yourself. ,1690000
This is very serious. ,6780000
Just know that. ,941000
ANDREW thinks this through. ,15000000
ANDREW WALSH How would this work? ,68000
BILL O'LEARY What does that mean? ,84400
ANDREW WALSH I guess I'm not even sure exactly what you are suggesting. ,133000
BILL O'LEARY Are you kidding me with this? 50 ANDREW WALSH No. BILL O'LEARY Every driver in your fleet gets a handgun. ,6600
ANDREW WALSH And a permit? ,202000
O'LEARY nods yes. ,22900
ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D) When? ,186000
BILL O'LEARY By Friday. ,81800000
ANDREW WALSH Are the permits legit? ,257000
BILL O'LEARY That depends what they do with it. ,15900
If they kill their wife with them, then no. ,472000
Then that is a very fake permit, and I'll walk away very quickly. ,1700000
But they just need to show that they are defending themselves, and this will stop. ,9910000
ANDREW WALSH Who is it? ,67900
BILL O'LEARY I don't fucking know... ,42700000
ANDREW WALSH I'll talk to him. ,176000
INT. MORALES' GARAGE - DAY ANNA is struggling through the boxes in the garage. ,99900
She moves some things and then finds what she is looking for. ,281000
A pile of about nine matching file boxes that are all labeled the same. ,79700
It is their off the books bookkeeping. ,69100
INT. STUDY/LIBRARY OF THE NEW HOUSE - DAY The library is filled with custom made bookshelves that are still waiting to be filled. ,453000
There is a large desk sitting in the corner that hasn't been fully unpacked yet. 51 ANNA comes in struggling carrying the file boxes from the garage, she piles them on the desk. ,25000
She looks around her feet at the pile, it's literally the skeletons from her closet. ,89500
She resets, walks over to the window to look out over her new beautiful home. ,100000
Then she turns back at the pile of boxes that hold their past and their future. ,4860000
EXT. LONG SUBURBAN DRIVEWAY - DAY A Standard Oil DRIVER steers his truck down the driveway. ,4720
As he approaches the end he sees a massive bulk oil truck of one of their competitors parked blocking the exit of the driveway. ,24100
He stops his truck and gets out warily. ,1290000
No one is in the cab of the truck. ,1070000
But he sees a small note taped to the window. ,23400
It reads: "Engine trouble, back later... ,266000
Fuck you." INT. STUDY/LIBRARY OF THE NEW HOUSE The phone starts ringing. ,1490000
ANNA gets up from her work and answers it. ,493000
We stay on her as she gets the news. ,4080000
ANNA He's not here. ,62900000
Her face fills with building anger as she hears. ,382000
ANNA (CONT'D) Okay. ,28100
ANNA hangs up the phone and walks over to the window and looks out and over at the other main wing of her new beautiful home. ,60000
Then she turns back and looks at the pile of boxes that hold their past and their future. ,3130000
EXT. GATE AT STANDARD HEATING OIL O'LEARY walks over to ANDREW as he is getting in his car. ,4240
ANDREW WALSH How did that go? ,71500
BILL O'LEARY Not well. ,301000
ANDREW WALSH He feels very strongly about this. 52 BILL O'LEARY I can see that. ,5860
ANDREW WALSH I don't think he fully understands it. ,19700
BILL O'LEARY What's to understand? ,81400000
ANDREW WALSH It's illegal. ,199000
BILL O'LEARY It's not illegal if I say it isn't. ,47500
This takes ANDREW back a step. ,331000
BILL O'LEARY (CONT'D) My responsibility is to provide safe and timely passage of goods and products into and around this city. ,954
And because of this situation it is appearing to those whose opinions I am concerned with, that I can't do that right now. ,389000
That can not and will not continue. ,22600000
ANDREW WALSH I understand. ,68200
BILL O'LEARY So talk to him. ,337000
You need to protect yourself. ,1690000
As a company. ,7910000
ANDREW WALSH I will try to talk with him. ,93900
BILL O'LEARY This is very serious. ,89600
Just know that. ,941000
ANDREW WALSH thinks this through. ,115000
ANDREW WALSH How would this work? ,71400
BILL O'LEARY What does that mean? ,68800
ANDREW WALSH I guess I'm not even sure exactly what you are suggesting. 53 BILL O'LEARY Are you kidding me with this? ,10800
ANDREW WALSH No. BILL O'LEARY Every driver in your fleet gets a handgun. ,11700
ANDREW WALSH And a permit? ,252000
O'LEARY nods yes. ,20800
ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D) When? ,186000
BILL O'LEARY By Friday. ,81800000
ANDREW WALSH Are the permits legit? ,318000
BILL O'LEARY That depends what they do with it. ,15900
If they kill their wife with them, then no. ,472000
Then that is a very fake permit, and I'll walk away very quickly. ,1700000
But they just need to show that they are defending themselves, and this will stop. ,9910000
ANDREW WALSH Who is it? ,71400
BILL O'LEARY I don't fucking know... ,42700000
INT. ABEL'S OFFICE - LATER ANDREW comes to the door. ,682000
ABEL is staring out the window but looks up as ANDREW sits down. ,180000
ANDREW WALSH They just got another truck. ,248000
ANDREW WALSH Who was driving? 54 ABEL Leo. ,163000
ANDREW WALSH Is he alright? ,71300
ANDREW WALSH The drivers' security aside... this shit is starting to have a very significant financial effect on us here. ,1400
It can't continue. ,187000
ANDREW WALSH How was your talk? (nothing) I spoke with him after. ,82500
He's going to keep going `til he gets the answer he's looking for. ,2100000
ABEL I said I wouldn't do it. ,163000
They sit for a long beat. ,212000
ANDREW WALSH I'm not sure we are in a position to say that. ,2600000
ABEL What's that? ,6610000
He tries to grab her purse, which she still has over her shoulder. ,99500
They struggle for it. ,640000
ABEL Where is this thing? ,16600000
Let me see it. ,3310000
ANNA Abel. ,6860
ABEL Let me see it. ,3830000
Is this going to make you safe? ,9700000
With that he uses brute force, probably hurting her arm, but she doesn't let on. ,6030
He takes the purse from her. ,1190000
He opens it and takes out the small gun. ,21100000
ABEL (CONT'D) You know who uses guns like this? (HE SCREAMS) Whores! 65 With that, she SLAPS him across the face. ,17700
They just stare at each other for a very long time. ,1750000
ABEL (CONT'D) It's a trap... and you are walking right into it... ,43800
You need to get that thing out of our house. ,88100000
ANNA You need to protect us. ,71300
ABEL That is what I'm doing. ,78700
He walks out the front door. ,1790000
INT. MAIN LIVING/DINING ROOM OF MORALES HOUSE - NEXT DAY There are twelve SEVEN-YEAR-OLDS sitting around the dining room table yelling "Happy Birthday" to one of the Morales daughters as she blows out the candles. ,5140
A large GROUP of the PARENTS surround the table. ,4290000
GROUP Happy Birthday! Just as ELIZABETH blows out the candles the doorbell rings. ,29400
NANNY MARIA heads to the front door. ,142000
The camera stays with the party. ,823000
NANNY MARIA comes back into the room and standing behind her, we see a POLICE OFFICER holding some kind of clipboard. ,21100
ABEL walks over quickly trying not to create a scene. ,1020000
He leads the POLICE OFFICER back over to the front door. ,901000
The PARENTS certainly notice and start stirring. ,1170000
EXT. FRONT STEPS - DAY ABEL leads the OFFICER outside, and as he looks up he sees that his driveway is packed with four police cars, some unmarked and there are about five OFFICERS waiting to come into the house. ,10400
But as you can see this is a terrible time for us. ,508000
I am having my daughter's birthday party. ,8230000
ABEL is trying to remain calm and not lose his temper. 66 POLICE OFFICER I understand and I apologize, I do. ,7260
But this is a warrant and we need to gain complete access to the property. ,2530000
They stare at each other just as ANNA comes to the door. ,1050000
She sees the scene in her driveway. ,572000
ANNA What is this? ,9980000
POLICE OFFICER Let me go check something. ,51800000
ABEL is seething and can only manage a slight nod. ,59900
As they look across the driveway they see the OFFICER talking to someone. ,1340000
The officer shifts out of the way and they see he is talking to ASSISTANT D.A. ,834000
LAWRENCE. ABEL I'm going to kill this guy. ,1730000
ANNA Abel. ,6860
ANNA is trying to get his attention quietly. ,16200000
ABEL Abel. ,116000
He turns and they look at each other. ,17100000
She signals towards the library and they share a knowing, concerned glance. ,575000
ABEL (CONT'D) Give me five minutes. ,76400000
She nods and heads down the path towards the police and LAWRENCE. Abel heads back in the doorway. ,67
ABEL (CONT'D) Maria. ,43100
Keep the kids playing for a few minutes. ,62800000
ANNA walks up to the LAWRENCE. ANNA Mr. Lawrence is it? 67 A.D.A. ,177000
LAWRENCE Yes. ,12500
ANNA Anna Morales. ,71500000
She reaches out her hand to shake his with a smile. ,109000
ANNA (CONT'D) May I speak with you for a minute. ,190000
They walk away from the others down the driveway a stretch. ,1130000
ANNA I understand you and your men have a job to do here. ,41600000
But we are in the middle of a seven-year-old's birthday party. ,1220000
LAWRENCE I understand, and I'm sorry. ,117000
But we are coming in. ,36300
She turns a little on him. ,4690000
ANNA That's not a problem, as we have nothing to hide from you. ,502000
It's just that, we recently moved to this area, and there are twenty guests in our house... please... can you give me five minutes so we can ask everyone to leave calmly before you come into my home? ,18700
He thinks this through. ,14600000
LAWRENCE You can get them out of the house. ,111000000
INT./EXT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE STUDY/DECK ABEL comes down the hall carrying file boxes and brings them out onto the deck. ,1760
ANNA comes out onto the deck as he is looking over the edge. 68 ANNA Where are you going? ,39800
ABEL Bring the last few out. ,209000
ANNA You've got three minutes. ,4040000
ABEL What's going on out there. ,139000000
ANNA Our guests are leaving. ,1970000
ABEL tries to speak but can only shake his head. ,90500
Finally he jumps over the edge and she starts handing boxes down to him. ,13600
He then stops again. ,5030000
ABEL Do we even need to be doing this? ,10200000
What exactly are we hiding here? ,5670000
She thinks this through. ,7
ANNA I don't want them going through all this before I've had a chance to. ,2490000
EXT. GROUND BELOW DECK The camera is now on the ground level with ABEL. ABEL Is that the last one. ,10100
Get back out there. ,115000000
ABEL looks around for a place to stash them. ,951000
MARGARET You're talking about my husband! DEE-ANN I know! That's why I brought it up. ,858000
Margaret frowns, insulted. 17. ,43200
MARGARET I'm not naive. (beat; she laughs) Well, I am naive. ,1700000
But I know the man I'm marrying. ,1410000
Walter can act rash... but he's a good provider. ,777000
And he's wonderful with Jane. (CLEAR-EYED) Look -- we're both looking for a fresh start. ,118000
I'm a divorcee with a child. ,610000
Walter is a blessing. ,5810000
Dee-Ann bites her tongue. ,17900
The WAITER brings over the check. ,744000
Sitting on it are TWO FORTUNE COOKIES. Hm. Margaret stares, utterly serious. ,12500
She reaches for one... then impulsively grabs the other. ,265000
She cracks the cookie. ,8870000
Dee- Ann waits, curious. ,79000
Margaret reads... then slowly smiles. ,1200000
MARGARET "You are on the threshold of untold success." INT. ART GALLERY - DAY A Modish, happening gallery. ,27100
The white walls are hung with ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONISM: Slashing angles of color, painted over rags and glued bolts. ,904
On the floor is SCULPTURE made from wood and wire. ,3390000
In charge is RUBEN, a fussy man in a goatee. ,17100
He's schmoozing a FANCY LADY. They look at a spattered, distorted painting. ,11000
RUBEN What's brilliant about the composition is its spontaneity. ,12100
The image has no visual center of attention. ,249000
RUBEN Oh definitely! Strongly influenced by the tachistes. ,9
FANCY LADY I heard Tab Hunter was in here, looking at one. ,275000
RUBEN Well... ,2300
I'm not allowed to say... ,1230000
He NODS HIS HEAD up-and-down: Yes, you're right. ,135000
OUTSIDE A car backfires. ,30200000
Ruben turns -- and winces. 18. ,575000
Through the windows is Walter, climbing out of his massive white Cadillac. ,15700
He's all done up, in beret and scarf. ,387000
He opens the giant trunk and removes a pile of paintings. ,25000
Ruben cringes knowingly. ,3340
He whispers: RUBEN Oh Christ, don't come in here. ,122000
Please don't come in here... ,2970000
The door SLAMS. Walter loudly barges in. ,8010
WALTER Ruben, good day! Do you got a minute? ,513000
RUBEN Walter. ,6130
In polite society, the word is "appointment." FANCY LADY (glancing back and forth) Uh, I could come back later... ,10800
She anxiously hurries for the door. ,80900
Ruben fumes. ,2800
Walter ignores it all and starts laying out his wares. ,37500
First, the Parisian street scenes, one after another... ,4130000
WALTER You're gonna love my stuff today. ,1240000
RUBEN Haven't I seen that one before? ,11900000
WALTER Nah! That was painted in the Fifth Arrondissement. ,27400
This is the Sixth Arrondissement! RUBEN (SKEPTICAL) I don't understand. ,1710000
You lived in Paris for a week. ,39900
How can you still be cranking out paintings? ,111000000
Walter laughs. ,1260
He points to his head. ,439000
WALTER It's all up here. (beat; a sentimental FLOURISH) And here. ,21800000
He points to his heart. ,437000
Ruben frowns and points to the wall. 19. ,2450000
RUBEN Well, it's not going up here. (CRUEL) Walter, you know we don't go for that representational jazz! You're too literal. ,14900
WALTER (HURT) Hey, Art isn't fashion! RUBEN Yes it IS! (CUTTING) People want Kandinsky, or Rothko! They don't want goopy street scenes. ,868
CLOSEUP - WALTER Ouch! This stings terribly. ,11000
Walter glares at the man, then softly slides aside his works. ,12500
Quietly, he pulls out Margaret's Big Eye paintings. ,158000
WALTER Would they want... this? ,73200000
RUBEN (HE SHUDDERS) Good God! You've entered a new period. ,13000
WALTER No... they're my wife's. ,67700000
Fascinated, Ruben glances through Margaret's oils. ,27700
Canvas after canvas of sad kiddies against gray, bleak backgrounds. ,25600
RUBEN Why are their eyes so big?! They're like big stale jellybeans. ,108000
WALTER (SNIDE) It's Expressionism. ,2150000
Surely you recognize it. ,42800000
RUBEN (LONG BEAT) Well -- I'm just glad you two found each other. ,582000
WALTER So... what do you say? ,81900000
Ruben looks up, amazed. ,3680000
Walter seems oblivious. 20. ,352000
RUBEN I say, NO! It's not art. ,1160000
WALTER (HORRIFIED) Not -- "art"?? ,81200
RUBEN It's like the back of a magazine! "Draw the turtle! Send in a nickel and win the Big Contest!" WALTER How dare you! Lots of people would like this. ,65800
RUBEN Well, nobody who's walking through the door of this gallery! (BEAT) Now please! Clear out this clutter, before the taste police arrives. ,69800
Walter's jaw drops. ,241000
CUT TO: EXT. HUNGRY I MARQUEE - NIGHT "The hungry i" -- the hottest nightclub around, so hip it's in a basement. ,65600
The marquee says "Cal Tjader, TONIGHT!" INT. HUNGRY I SHOWROOM - NIGHT A swinging mob of BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE -- suits, gowns and pearls. ,6
CAL TJADER'S BAND is crazed: Vibes and bongo-driven JAZZ. Margaret and Walter are squeezed at a table. ,38
She nurses a Grasshopper. ,142000
Walter's in a foul mood, CHUGGING cocktails. ,15900
WALTER We'll never break in...! Because there's a CABAL. A secret society of gallery owners and critics, who get together for Sunday brunch in Sausalito, deciding what's "cool." (BROODING) They're like Freemasons. ,69
No, worse! McCarthy, in his hearings: "That painter, I anoint. ,281000
That painter, I banish to nowheresville!" Heartfelt, Margaret disagrees. ,12600
MARGARET I think people buy art because it touches them -- 21. ,3520000
WALTER Heh! You're livin' in fairy land! People don't get to discover a thing. ,27400
They buy art, because it's in the right place at the right time. ,2300000
O.s., MUSIC BUILDS. Muddled, Walter turns. ,1320000
He looks -- and then -- his eyes light up. ,44400000
He is getting an idea... ,7090000
ONSTAGE The band speeds to a climax, the percussion throbbing. ,10200
Then, a final, crazed note. ,6010000
BAM!! The crowd APPLAUDS. The club's owner, ENRICO BANDUCCI, bounds on stage. ,3
Banducci is a theatrical, natty Italian guy with a skinny moustache and loud personality. ,1280
He grabs a mike. ,9340000
BANDUCCI Give it up for Cal Tjader! That set was HUMMIN'! Al-aright, be sure to stick around for the one a.m. show! The house lights come up. ,2
Banducci hops down, greeting guests, making his way out -- when Walter glides up. ,5630
WALTER Hey, Banducci. ,20700
I love the music tonight. ,99700000
It's a gas. ,26300000
BANDUCCI Oh. Thanks, thanks. ,11400000
WALTER I'm Walter Keane. ,554000
I'm a painter. (KNOWING) I was looking at your walls, and they're pretty plain. ,3410000
BANDUCCI Really? ,3840
Hm...! Maybe you're right. ,13600000
What color were you thinking? ,29800000
Walter holds his composure. ,1530000
WALTER No -- I'm an artist. ,31800000
I used to be based on the Left Bank. ,17000000
But now I've relocated to the "States," and I'm looking for an... exhibition venue. ,654000
Banducci frowns. ,2
BANDUCCI I like my club the way it is. ,6800000
Your stuff's so hot, go put it in a museum. 22. ,53800000
WALTER Okay! I respect that. ,204000
You're a businessman, not a charity! So how 'bout if I, uh... rented your walls? ,28300
Hm?! Banducci raises an eyebrow. ,8
CUT TO: INT. BERKELEY APARTMENT - DAY Walter's swanky pad is CHAOS, filled with cameras and lights. ,1260
A PHOTOGRAPHER runs around, tweaking equipment. ,413000
Walter's at an easel, putting the final touches on a PAINTING of a French street scene. ,12400
He gabs on the PHONE. WALTER Yes! The paintings are available for public viewing daily, from 7 to 3! (an awkward beat) Er, no. 3 a.m. ,48500
It's in a nightclub. (he hangs up) Maggie! It's promotion time! We gotta lay the racket! Margaret puts on a smock, a bit dumbfounded. ,3210
Walter spatters some paint on his shirt. ,438000
He grins, then holds up his brush and SIGNS the painting: "W. ,30000
KEANE" Margaret forces a "cheese" smile, with her Waif. ,82900
FLASH! The camera pops. ,3340000
CUT TO: INT. HUNGRY I - NIGHT CU - A cheery BROCHURE, "Meet the Keanes!" There's a staged PHOTO: Walter at his street scene, Margaret at her Waif. ,23
Then -- a SHOE steps on it. ,4590000
We WIDEN... revealing the brochure on the sticky floor of... ,13700
THE CLUB! It throbs with frolicking CUSTOMERS. We move through the pack. ,3150
To a rear concrete hallway... to a sign with an arrow: "TOILETS." We go down the hall... into... ,35500
A DINGY CORRIDOR The Keane paintings hang here. ,12300
The only human in sight is Walter, forlorn at a card table. ,236000
Brochures are stacked, and he wears a sailor coat with a dandyish ascot. ,3750
The image is grim. ,34200000
Walter listens to the raucous mob. ,4820000
Until, THUMP! -- a sloshed MAN stumbles in. ,9520
Walter brightens and stands. 23. ,12300
WALTER Ah, beautiful! An art lover! Yes sir, how may I help you? ,76000
MAN (UNCLEAR) I'm, uh, just looking for the john. ,312000
A terrible pause. ,1000000
Walter swallows his outrage... then points. ,802000
The guy smiles and tosses Walter a BUCK, as a tip. ,27900
Walter is stunned. ,2820000
The guy toddles away. ,4360000
The Ladies Room opens, and TWO GOSSIPY WOMEN rush out, oblivious to Walter. ,188000
He glowers. ,8800000
ANOTHER MAN bounds in, right up to one of Walter's paintings! He stops at it. ,21900
Walter gathers a moment of hope. ,214000
Does he like it? ,73000000
Then the man leans down and opens a CLOSET. He removes a tray of bar glasses, kicks the door shut, and scoots away. ,4320
ANGLE - WALTER He grimaces... beaten. ,12200
Walter drops his head on the table. ,399000
Not noticing a DRUNK COUPLE stagger in. ,47000
They pass a Waif, then halt -- taken. ,94800
They lean in. ,14700000
Enthralled... concerned... ,21
TIPSY LADY Look at that child. ,117000
She's so sad. ,1180000
TIPSY MAN Is she poor..? ,260000
TIPSY LADY She's forgotten! It just makes me want to cry. (she peers at the signature, then turns) Are you "Keane"? ,894000
Walter lifts his head from the table. ,99000
WALTER Yeah. ,3770
TIPSY LADY Well you're a hell of a painter. ,215000
Walter squints, confused, then beams. ,6560
Joy! Happiness bursting like a little child. ,53600
WALTER Why, thank you...! Thank you so much! 24. ,57600000
TIPSY LADY Your work is very powerful. ,52700000
There's so much emotion in those eyes. ,275000
OUCH! Walter's smile collapses. ,20300
TIPSY LADY Is something wrong? ,289000
WALTER (REELING) Huh? ,1440000
Uh... no. ,283000
No. I just didn't realize you meant... the waif. ,1400000
TIPSY MAN (beat; he CHUCKLES) Oh, I get it...! The artist doesn't wanna part with his favorite piece... ,13100000
The man winks, then pulls out a WAD OF BILLS. Walter stares morosely. ,12100
INT. HUNGRY I - LATER Walter sits at the bar, toasted, drinking. ,32700
In a dark place. ,32100000
His misery is interrupted by happy Banducci, groping two GALS. BANDUCCI Hello, Picasso! Nice crowd, eh? ,2
WALTER (SOUR) You wouldn't know it from that broom closet you parked me in. ,210000
BANDUCCI Hey, it's prime thoroughfare! People drink, they gotta relieve themselves. ,104000
WALTER (MUTTERING) "Location, location, location..." Walter wallows in self-loathing. ,44100
Suddenly, he explodes. ,7850000
WALTER It's INSULTING! When people see art, they shouldn't think of SHIT! BANDUCCI (SHOCKED) Whoah! Watch it with the purple language. ,40000
We got ladies present --! Banducci PUSHES Walter away. 25. ,19100
In reaction, Walter sloppily SMACKS him. ,12800
Riled, Banducci suddenly takes a SWING! Walter stumbles, and Banducci's punch accidently HITS the GIRL. Ow! She topples. ,4700
Walter gasps. ,90
He SWATS Banducci -- then RUNS! Cameras FLASH. Wild whoops. ,3
Walter barrels down the hall, Banducci chasing. ,72900
The brawl's gone nuts. ,85200
Walter grabs a Waif and SMASHES it over Banducci's head. ,2090
CRASH! Banducci drops. ,7060
EXT. POLICE STATION - DAWN A neighborhood precinct, quiet at 6 a.m. ,93900
Doors open, and Margaret leads Walter out. ,129000
She's seething. ,516000
He's bruised, with a mortified drunk-tank, slept-in-my-clothes swagger. ,35800
MARGARET I've never posted bail before. ,4460000
He has no idea what to say. ,8660000
His aplomb crumbles. ,10400
WALTER I'm -- I'm sorry. ,3580000
Banducci... laughed at our work. ...So I socked him. ,104000
MARGARET Since when are you thin-skinned? ,18700
Artists have to handle criticism. ,29300
WALTER You're right! I know. ,2420000
But... ,25400000
I was already in a bad place. ,1680000
I'd had a couple... and earlier... (PAUSE) I let some guy think I painted your Big Eye. ,651000
Margaret is stupefied. ,17000
MARGARET I don't understand. ,468000
Why would you do such a thing?! WALTER It was a misunderstanding. ,101000000
And then, I didn't want to jinx the sale. 26. ,3080000
He shrugs feebly. ,885000
She frowns. ,17500
MARGARET Don't ever do it again. ,14000000
INT. HUNGRY I - NIGHT The club is a ZOO. PARTYERS swarm the door, trying to enter. ,2200000
Suddenly, Walter pushes his way down the outside stairs. ,54900
The DOORMAN starts to protest, but Walter somberly waves him off. ,12200
WALTER Don't give me a hard time. ,708000
I'm just grabbing my stuff... ,99500000
Across the packed room, he spots Banducci with a black eye. ,52300
Walter halts, uncertain. ,91200
A bristling tension... ,17300
Until -- Banducci suddenly rushes and GRABS him! Walter flails, freaked. ,453
Banducci DRAGS him into a back kitchen -- INT. CLUB KITCHEN Banducci shuts the door, looks around... then suddenly LAUGHS! He grins manically and pulls Walter into a hearty HUG. BANDUCCI Can you believe this? ,3
We're sold out, and I don't even have a headliner!! (GLEEFUL) Hell, it's a Monday! Walter blinks, lost. ,6740
Banducci explains. ,7
BANDUCCI Dope, we made the front page!! People are here, cause they wanna see the sappy paintings that made grown men fight!! A moment of discombobulation... until -- Walter slowly grins. ,543
INT. CLUB - SECONDS LATER The two men suddenly tumble into view, SCREAMING. WALTER I'll see you in COURT, you son of a bitch! I'm suing you for assault! Slander! False arrest!! Banducci storms away. ,51
Walter shudders, "upset." CUSTOMERS peer at him... then at the paintings. ,8610
Curious, they migrate that way... 27. ,154000
Walter glances sideways. ,58500
Gauging their reactions... ,16800000
Until -- a swinging middle-aged guy in horn rims and a suit lopes up. ,216000
Dick leans in. ,1260
That was quite a load of horseshit you gents were layin' out there. (LONG BEAT) Dick Nolan. ,157000
The Examiner. ,693000
Walter freezes up. ,197000
Until -- Dick grins conspiratorially. ,9690
DICK Hey pal, don't lose any sleep. ,55300
I eat this stuff with a spoon! It gives me something to type about, in my column. ,960000
WALTER (he laughs, relieved) I thought you only did celebrities. ,357000
DICK Well, Banducci's famous -- and you hit him! So you're a celebrity, once- removed. (HE CHUCKLES) Buy me a drink? ,828
WALTER Huh? ,3160
Uh, sure -- Dick smoothly drags him to the bar. ,2540000
Dick waves the bartender. ,65200
DICK Gary! I'll have a Ward Eight, in a frosted high boy. ,191000
My friend'll have the same. (he beams, then turns) So! Walter, tell me about your work -- WALTER Well, when I was in Paris... ,246000
DICK Jesus, not those! I mean the little hobo kids. ,39000000
What?! Walter frowns, peeved. ,20500
He smiles fakely, effusively. ,8740
WALTER What do you wanna know...?! CUT TO: 28. ,2310000
INT. BERKELEY APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT Margaret is asleep. ,82200
Suddenly Walter bursts in, drunk and jocular. ,10700
He FLIPS on the lights. ,440000
WALTER Ding-a-ling! Wake up, we're a HIT! Margaret rolls over, groggy. ,1210
Walter jumps on the bed, grinning. ,178000
He tosses her a HANDFUL OF MONEY. WALTER What a night! I sold out all your Big Eyes!! She rubs her eyes, amazed. ,7630
MARGARET There must be two-hundred dollars... ,26900000
WALTER They adore you! Cause of that article, the joint was PACKED. And then, a famous journalist showed up, and -- I need more paintings! Now! He hungrily KISSES her. ,659
She laughs. ,308000
MARGARET Walter, they take at least a week. ,47600000
There's layering, shading -- WALTER Of course! But, this is opportunity! Ah, we're gonna make a crackerjack team: Me schmoozing up the club, while you're back here, doing what you love! She stares at him -- then smiles. ,34
CUT TO: INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT Margaret happily paints away. ,63300
At peace, lost in her art... ,51800
INT. HUNGRY I - NIGHT Walter sells Big Eyes. ,164000
Shoving cash into a cigar box. ,12800
INT. APARTMENT - DAY Margaret works, HUMMING serenely. ,1260000
On the easel is a half- finished blonde girl in a blue dress. 29. ,439000
INT. TAILOR'S - DAY Walter buys a new suit. ,272000
A TAILOR measures him. ,815000
INT. APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT Margaret finishes painting a sad boy, using a fine brush to add a watery rim to his eyes. ,35700
Magically, this detail brings the picture to life. ,26900
She's pleased. ,10200000
Margaret signs "KEANE." There are two finished canvases, the sad little girl and boy. ,5060
Margaret smiles, her heart swelling. ,151000
She loves them. ,6480000
Then, she looks about. ,4
Nobody is there to share the moment. ,6410000
Hm. She thinks -- then picks up the PHONE. She dials. ,105000
MARGARET Mrs. ,17000
Cava, I'm sorry to bother you so late... but would you mind watching Jane? ,57200
She proudly hugs the bundled paintings to her chest. ,3750
INT. HUNGRY I - NIGHT The club is pounding. ,627000
Margaret enters the throng, carrying her work. ,12200
She looks up -- and has her breath taken away. ,634000
The ENTIRE CLUB, EVERY WALL, IS NOW HUNG WITH KEANE PAINTINGS! Whoa...! Pure joy envelops her. ,5890
Then -- she gets jostled. ,30700
Margaret notices Walter holding court with some GROUPIES. She approaches, unnoticed: WALTER ...yeah, eyes are powerful. ,30600
A poet said they're the windows of the soul. ,637000
Margaret smiles, touched. ,407000
She comes closer.... ,104000
GROUPIE They hold so much feeling. ,5680000
WALTER You got it! That's why I paint 'em so big. (BEAT) I've always done it that way. ,1310000
CLOSEUP - MARGARET She GASPS, stunned. ,65000
The room starts spinning. 30. ,743000
HER POV WALTER If you like this style, I'm working on a few new pieces. ,10800000
I've got a little blonde girl in a blue dress that'll tear your heart out. ,624000
ANGLE - MARGARET Her face goes ashen. ,2360000
Dizzy, she clutches for support. ,5710000
What to do?? ,9580000
Overcome, she shrinks away... disappearing... ending up alone in a corner. ,53300
She cowers, childlike. ,8930
ACROSS THE ROOM Walter LAUGHS at a joke, then backslaps the group. ,48400
He jovially strides away... passing by Margaret... when -- MARGARET Walter...? ,39800
He spins -- shocked at her presence. ,79200
WALTER Baby! (DISCOMBOBULATED) Hey, uh, what are you doing here? ,93400
I UM -- MARGARET Why are you lying? ,2320000
For once, Walter has no answer. ,47500000
She bores in, emotions racing. ,32900
Confused. ,13700000
Hurt. ,15500000
MARGARET You're taking credit for something that isn't yours. ,3540000
He looks ill. ,9150
Wheels spinning, looking for an out -- WALTER I was... trying to close the deal -- MARGARET Those children are part of my being! WALTER I'm just a salesman! You know, buyers pay more if they meet the painter -- MARGARET They couldn't meet me, because you told me to stay home!! 31. ,30000
WALTER Shh, QUIET! He grabs her, pulling her behind a curtain. ,10700
He's desperate. ,14900000
WALTER Don't blow this! Look, we're makin' money! Your pocket, my pocket? ,484000
What's the difference?! MARGARET (TREMBLING) You take this so lightly -- WALTER Not all all! But it's not about ego! You wanna say you did the street scenes? ,22200
Fine! I don't care! Say a monkey painted it! She breaks into tears, sobbing. ,8870
MARGARET I'm glad you can dash off your pieces without any emotional connection...! WALTER Ah, honey! I just wanna share them with the world! (BEAT) Would you rather have your children piled in a closet... or hanging in someone's living room? ,34300
Then -- FLASH! FLASH! FLASH! Walter turns. ,7390000
And -- his eyes pop, astonished. ,6420000
AT THE DOOR Is an incredible sight. ,1180000
Like a moment from "La Dolce Vita," a fabulously dressed ITALIAN MAN with THREE BLONDES floats down the stairs, into the club. ,1940
Cameras FLASH. Walter gapes, transfixed. ,2610
He grabs Banducci. ,84600
WALTER Hey. ,5850
Who is that remarkably handsome and confident man? ,3970000
BANDUCCI That's Dino Olivetti -- as in Olivetti typewriters. (HE SMIRKS) (MORE) 32. ,885
BANDUCCI (CONT'D) Don't even try, Walter. ,119000
He doesn't speak a lick of English. ,3500000
Walter stares hungrily. ,17100
ANGLE - OLIVETTI glides into the club -- a vision of perfection with his slick hair and sunglasses. ,11
He approaches closer, closer... when he gets distracted. ,688000
By one of Margaret's Big Eye PAINTINGS. Walter gasps. ,68000
He nudges Margaret. ,23200
Olivetti peers at the artwork. ,5910
Intrigued. ,1500000
Then -- excited. ,313000
He starts gesturing and yapping in ITALIAN. The Blondes shout back. ,10800
Everyone is getting worked-up. ,4640000
EUROPEAN BLONDE Mr. Olivetti is enchanted with the painting. ,97500
He would like to know... who is the artist? ,367000
ANGLE - MARGARET AND WALTER The moment of truth. ,128000
Margaret opens her mouth... and no sound comes out. ,162000
She clenches up. ,101000
Stomach tight. ,36100
Mute. ,15100000
Walter gives her a second -- tick tock tick tock. ,1140000
Then -- he leaps into Opportunity. ,297000
He SMACKS his hands. ,1440000
WALTER I am! Walter swoops over and grabs Olivetti in a hearty clasp. ,4010
WALTER It's a delight to meet you, Signore! Buon giorno! Have you been an art lover for long..? ,37100
We move in tight on MARGARET, as the SOUND DIALS DOWN. WALTER'S VOICE I call that piece "The Waif." Isn't it striking? ,5410
With its juxtaposition of girl, cat, and stairs... and its almost Flemish use of underpigment... ,12300
The SOUND dims... then goes SILENT. Margaret stares in shock, unmoving. ,112000
Time seems to stop. ,14000000
She is frozen in grief. ,266000
Until -- 33. ,234000
WALTER'S VOICE Baby! Baby! Can you believe it?!! CUT TO: MINUTES LATER Time has passed. ,93000
Walter happily clutches Margaret. ,3330
WALTER We made five grand!! Five THOUSAND dollars...!!! (GIDDY) And that wasn't even one of your good ones! Margaret blinks, lost. ,1740
In the b.g., Olivetti holds the painting, now wrapped-up in newspaper and twine. ,358000
A pleased customer. ,7210
Margaret's face darkens. ,139000
MARGARET Don't you mean... one of your good ones? ,79000
WALTER No. No no! One of -- OUR good ones. (the spirit of generosity, he hands her a CHECK) Look at those zeroes! We've hit the big time! We are now hanging in the collection of Italian industrialist Dino Olivetti! With his patronage comes credibility! And with credibility comes RESPECT! Margaret stares at the check in her hands. ,2
At all the zeroes. ,1380000
MARGARET What about... honesty? ,6090000
WALTER Aw c'mon! The paintings say "Keane"! I'm Keane, you're Keane. ,15900
From now on, we are one and the same. ,34200000
Walter pulls her tight. ,584000
She doesn't resist. ,2060000
CUT TO: SERIES OF SHOTS: 34. ,2660000
INT. APARTMENT - DAY Upbeat MUSIC. Walter frantically tosses all the BROCHURES of him and Margaret into a FIREPLACE. They burn to ash. ,965
INSERT - NEWSPAPER We ZOOM into Dick Nolan's SOCIETY COLUMN. Under a caricature of Dick is a highlighted ITEM. We hear TYPING: DICK'S HUSHED VOICE "What exactly is local painter Walter Keane up to? ,2280
My spies tell me a big announcement is forthcoming...!" EXT. CITY HALL - DAY Walter proudly hands a painting to the confused-looking MAYOR. WALTER On behalf of the children of the world, we present this painting to Mayor Christopher! EXT. PUBLIC BUILDING - DAY Walter thrusts a painted Ballerina at a SOVIET DIPLOMAT. WALTER In the interest of peace through culture, we donate this painting to the people of Russia! INT. PHONEBOOTH - NIGHT Dick whispers into a phone. ,9090
DICK The Purple Onion. 9:30. ,234000
Joan Crawford has a dinner reservation. ,382000
INT. PURPLE ONION - NIGHT JOAN CRAWFORD is eating with friends. ,15000
Suddenly Walter lunges into view, startling her. ,39200
He lugs a painting. ,408000
WALTER Miss Crawford! In recognition of your cinematic craft, we bestow this painting, "The Lion and the Child"! INT. APARTMENT - DAY Margaret paints. ,22100
Walter beams. 35. ,1930000
WALTER Joan said "Marvelous"! MARVELOUS! That's worth more than 1000 critics! (he CLAPS his hands) Hey, maybe she'll come to our opening. ,16500
MARGARET But... isn't it strange? ,24200
Artists get shown. ,34
They don't build their own galleries. ,49600000
WALTER Says who?! Like John Q. ,220000
Public cares? ,24000
He's FED UP with abstract neoformalism! She responds -- but he sexily puts his finger to her mouth. ,2340
WALTER He digs real art. ,778000
Your art! It's beautiful. ,45
You're beautiful... ,2990000
She laughs, embarrassed, her wet paint brushes smearing his chest. ,5870
She relents and relaxes. ,12200000
They dance around... ,79800000
CUT TO: EXT. CITY STREETS - EARLY MORNING In the shadows, POSTERS of "The Waif" get glued up. ,12300
Under her woeful face, it says "KEANE GALLERY 494 Broadway." We WIDEN, as Walter, Margaret and Jane hastily slap up the posters. ,492
They carry glue buckets and a ladder. ,508000
WALTER Ruben's gonna choke when he sees this! Little Jane tiredly glues another poster. ,1000
She yawns. ,11600
JANE I remember when Momma painted that. ,2800000
Suddenly, Margaret freezes. ,138000
She hadn't anticipated this. ,280000
Margaret looks to Walter. ,2260000
He stares back, waiting. ,96000
MARGARET Are you -- sure? ,43500000
That was a long time ago. ,1030000
JANE Sure I'm sure! It was in our old apartment, and you had me sit on a stool in the kitchen -- 36. ,165000
WALTER (CUTTING IN) No, dear, I'm afraid you're confused. ,357000
I painted that one -- JANE No, Mother did! Look! I'm wearing my blue dress. ,3730000
MARGARET L-lots of girls have that dress... ,67200
Margaret trails off, sickened. ,807000
Not knowing how to lie. ,1770000
Walter takes charge. ,3320000
WALTER You have a good eye, sweetie. ,62300000
I painted it, but I was trying to mimic your mother's style. ,1290000
You know, the style she USED to paint in. ,49500000
CLOSEUP - JANE A loooooong pause. ,5840
She examines the print. ,16500000
Then... she nods. ,26300
JANE Well you did a really good job. ,32200000
CUT TO: EXT. SAN FRANCISCO NORTH BEACH - DAY CU on the Waif. ,23000
We widen, revealing the ENTIRE WORLD has been hijacked, blanketed by THE POSTERS. People gape -- astonished and captivated. ,9680
Disconnected from it all, strolling alone, is Margaret. ,9420
She is burdened by her own thoughts. ,151000
Regretful... ,505000
Across the street, she sees a GOTHIC CHURCH. She stares up, awed by the beauty. ,96800
It's Catholic imagery in all its glory: Saints... ,2520000
Mary... ,18200000
Suddenly -- the bells RING. Hm. Margaret takes a step... ,115000
INT. CHURCH CONFESSION BOOTH - DAY Margaret tentatively enters and kneels. ,6400
Beat -- then the grille OPENS. She reacts, discomposed. ,1380
MARGARET Hello. ,4530
I've -- never really done this before. ,133000
I'm not sure how you... (WORRIED) I was raised Methodist. ,5410000
If it's a problem, I can go -- 37. ,97800000
She starts to stand. ,187000
The Priest blurts out. ,182000
PRIEST'S VOICE No, no! Please. ,24500000
We don't chase people away. (BEAT) What is troubling you? ,1680000
Margaret takes a breath. ,731000
THEN -- MARGARET I lied to my child. ,184000
Pause. ,17300000
PRIEST'S VOICE Why would you do that? ,2440000
MARGARET My husband... he pressured me into doing it. (PAUSE) I've never lied to her before. ,52400
I'm not that kind of person. ,54200000
PRIEST'S VOICE Is your husband that kind of person? ,2890000
MARGARET Ummm, no. ,848000
I don't think of him that way. ,86900
I mean, he likes to tell stories... maybe he exaggerates a little... but he's a good man. (SHE THINKS) He takes care of us. ,1130000
He wants to make enough money to buy our family a house... ,1020000
PRIEST'S VOICE But what of the child? ,2490000
Will this lie bring harm to her? ,902000
MARGARET "Harm"?? ,784000
Oh! Not at all. (BEAT) I'm just looking for answers... ,26200000
The Priest considers this. ,6880000
PRIEST'S VOICE Well, the modern world is a complicated place. (MORE) 38. ,987000
PRIEST'S VOICE (CONT'D) Occasionally, children need to be sheltered from certain truths. ,18500
MARGARET N-no. ,116000
That's not what -- PRIEST'S VOICE It sounds like your husband is trying to make the best of an imperfect situation. (BEAT) You were raised Christian, so you know what we are taught: The man is head of the household. (BEAT) Perhaps you should trust his judgment. ,26200
CUT TO: INT. KEANE GALLERY - NIGHT Opening night! The gallery is packed with the IN CROWD: Rich and drinking. ,2970
The space is cool -- the walls bright white, the art hanging under spotlights. ,3760000
JAZZ plays on the stereo. ,2410000
At one painting, a HIPSTER COUPLE stares at the image of a sorrowful girl holding an armful of poodle puppies. ,13600
HIPSTER LADY I think it's creepy, maudlin and amateurish. ,7370
HIPSTER MAN Exactly. ,2150000
We move in tight on the painting. ,46700000
Underneath is a tag: "BEDTIME, by WALTER KEANE. Oil on canvas." We drift along, to another painting: "CALICO CAT, by WALTER KEANE." Then, another: "IN THE GARDEN, by WALTER KEANE." Every painting is now by Walter Keane. ,6
We move along... finding the Tipsy Man chatting up Dick. ,72100
TIPSY MAN We got in early. ,19800000
We own three. (HE TURNS) Thanks, doll. ,2960000
He tosses his empty to a PASSING LADY. We reveal the waitress is... ,663000
Margaret. ,15100000
She carries a tray of pigs-in-a-blanket. ,6670
Margaret looks shell-shocked -- faking a happy party face. ,42400
A burst of LAUGHTER. Margaret turns. 39. ,4520
Walter and a group ROAR at a joke. ,172000
A SEXY GIRL hands Walter one of the promo posters. ,599000
He beams and lays it across her back... hugging her waist to "steady" himself as he signs. ,12200
BACK ON MARGARET She frowns. ,3170000
Dee-Ann slides into view, slurping champagne. ,273000
DEE-ANN Hey, baby! Killer party! It's a hap- pen-ing...! So, where's your stuff? ,77600
MARGARET (NERVOUS) Oh. Um, we decided that this would be Walter's show -- DEE-ANN (SUSPICIOUS) Oh "we" did?? ,132000000
And why would "we" do that?? ,117000000
MARGARET Well... he's more established. ,24500000
DEE-ANN Please! Is that you talking, or did you just turn into a little felt puppet with someone's hand up your ass? ,1880
Margaret is befuddled. ,19800
Dee-Ann scopes out the artwork. ,18100
Walter doesn't strike me as the cute hungry kitten type... ,316000
Margaret grimaces. ,23
MARGARET Thanks for coming. ,47100
Margaret grabs a drink and hurries away. ,33300
Dee-Ann stands there, irked. ,266000
Margaret cuts over to Walter. ,5100000
We MOVE IN TIGHT ON THE COUPLE. He grins and grabs her. ,420000
WALTER Ah, my sweet! Are you enjoying the scene? (he gives her a kiss) EVERYONE! (MORE) 40. ,106000
WALTER (CONT'D) Give a hand to my beautiful wife. ,90900
Without her, none of tonight would be possible! The crowd APPLAUDS politely, condescendingly. ,22600
Margaret smiles strangely. ,407000
The Tipsy Man leans in. ,2630000
TIPSY MAN Your husband's quite a talent. (PLEASANT) Do you paint, too? ,250000
Margaret freezes up, terribly awkward. ,124000
MARGARET I don't... know. ,9240000
AT WALTER A NOSY GUY corners him in front of a painted child. ,557000
NOSY GUY I'm curious about your technique. ,2460000
How long did that piece take to execute? ,2250000
WALTER That? ,26100
Oh, wow. ,676000
Probably... months. ,9960
First the thinking, the sketching, and then time with just me and the oils. ,2720000
NOSY GUY "Oils"? ,1500000
But isn't that acrylic...? ,3590000
Walter glances at the painting, startled. ,12300
WALTER Oh --! You mean that painting! Uhh, sorry! It's like a jumble of ideas, rattling around in my brain! Beat. ,11600
NOSY GUY So where do you get your ideas? ,8630000
WALTER What do you mean? ,115000000
NOSY GUY I mean -- (confused at this confusion) Why are they... images of children? ,248000
Yikes. ,947000
Walter starts to sweat. ,279000
He didn't think this through. 41. ,8230000
WALTER Well, er, I've just always loved kids. ,1360000
Though mostly I was influenced by my darling daughter... ,84000
An odd beat. ,12800000
WALTER I remember when she was a baby... ,130000
Walter gets a far-off look. ,135000
WALTER Yeah. ,3760
Cute little thing. ,48600000
I'd stare into those big orbs. ,2330000
Sometimes I'd get out my Brownie and snap a photo... but... that's not subjective. ,1210000
It doesn't capture your feelings. ,55100000
So that's when I started painting her... ,15600000
We hold on Walter, unsure where reality begins and ends... ,87700
CUT TO: INT. BERKELEY APARTMENT - DAY CU on a fuzzy TV SCREEN: A PRIGGISH MAN is griping. ,1130
The screen is captioned "JOHN CANADAY, NY TIMES ART CRITIC" CANADAY (ON TV) Keane's work is completely without distinction. ,10
He is not a member of the Society of Western Artists. ,43800000
He has won no awards. ,7820000
He's only noteworthy for his appearances in a certain newspaper's gossip column! (EXASPERATED) Mr. Keane is why society NEEDS critics! To protect them from such atrocities! Walter gapes at the TV, outraged. ,539
He suddenly grabs a PHONE. IN THE LIVING ROOM Jane is BANGING on a closed door. ,7970
MARGARET (O.S.) Uhh, you can't. ,77100
Mommy's busy. ,1330000
JANE (she BANGS again) Let me in! What are you doing in there? ,3020000
Why's the door always locked? 42. ,11800000
He glides over to the girl. ,163000
WALTER Janie, sweetie, you need to respect your mother's privacy. ,6040
Sometimes grownups need alone time. (HE WINKS) Is that the ice cream truck? ,1110000
Why don't you go get yourself a fudgesicle? ,32200000
Walter tosses her a dime. ,20300
She peers warily, then leaves. ,21000
He waits a beat -- then pulls out a KEY. Walter discreetly unlocks the painting room. ,4120
INT. APARTMENT PAINTING ROOM - SAME TIME It's a factory. ,477000
Big Eyes are everywhere. ,4
Margaret frenziedly works, surrounded by half-done canvases, solvents, easels. ,5730
She's in a bathrobe -- a cigarette hanging from her lips. ,192000
Startled, she looks up to see Walter. ,34700000
He gazes at all the art. ,379000
At the bulbous faces, eyes watery and submissive, trapped in muddy yellows and dire browns. ,4420
And then... ,16300000
Walter grins broadly. ,42200
WALTER Whew! Out of this world...! MARGARET (BOTHERED) I dunno. ,66500
I'm not really comfortable with this. ,230000
Jane and I used to be so close... but -- now... ,4980000
WALTER Ah, Jane's grand! She's eating ice cream! She has new shoes. ,185000
She has a college fund. ,659000
MARGARET Maybe I'm lightheaded from the turpentine. ,64
I've been in here all day. ,2250000
WALTER Well I don't want you feeling like a prisoner. ,523000
Take a break! Walter glances at one PAINTING -- then does a take. ,227000
ANGLE - PAINTING It's a child in a rusty alley, staring, aching for compassion. ,31900
And, starting to cry. ,12200000
A single tear streams down her cheek. 43. ,99300
WALTER Is that a tear...? ,3600000
You've gone deep! Margaret bites her fingers, worried. ,451000
MARGARET Do you -- like it? ,399000000
WALTER I love it! ...How'd you get the eyes so lifelike? ,52500000
Is it the highlights? ,16100000
MARGARET (PROUD) No. The secret is the shadow. ,551000
I shadowed the eyelid. ,18600
Margaret smiles shyly. ,407000
Walter smiles back, full of warmth. ,208000
He takes her face in his hands. ,1790000
WALTER I owe you an apology. ,382000
I was initially dismissive of your kids, those emotion- wrenching blobs of humanity... but they have a real strength. ,9740
MARGARET (SHE LAUGHS) Is that your best version of sincerity? ,2500000
WALTER I'm trying! Ah, you know me. ,3900000
See -- this is why I need your help! I want to go on tv, to defend our art. ,44900000
MARGARET You're going to be on television?! WALTER Yes! But... what will I say?? (BEAT) Meaning -- what compels me... to paint... these paintings?? ,81700
A bizarre pause. ,475000
The two of them look around the room. ,24100000
At all the Big Eyes peering down at them. ,322000
MARGARET Maybe you have an unhealthy obsession with little girls. ,257000
WALTER Cute. 44. ,4740000
MARGARET (SHE SNICKERS) I guess you've painted yourself into a corner. ,366000
WALTER Funny! Keep 'em coming! You're a regular Steve Allen. ,151000
You want heat this winter? ,1650000
Help me out! MARGARET Walter... art is personal. ,52300000
Walter picks up a picture of TWO LITTLE GIRLS IN TUTUS. He stares, perplexed. ,9510
WALTER What would make a grown man paint a picture like this?! No answer. ,4540000
He thinks of stories, wheels spinning. ,3680000
WALTER I grew up, surrounded by six sisters. (NO GOOD) I grew up in an orphanage? (STRUGGLING) I grew up... in a world where adults had vanished, and children and kittens ran wild over the desolate landscape! Margaret smiles. ,714
MARGARET What about your Paris street scenes? ,369000
Why do you paint those? ,8360000
WALTER Well, because... ,11800000
I lived it! I experienced it! MARGARET (calling his bluff) And was it really all sun-dappled streets and flower vendors? ,40000
Walter stares off at the Waifs. ,12600
They peer out from broken windows... chain-link fences... ,92300
And then -- he gets it. ,3550000
WALTER Well -- NO! Of course not. ,10900000
It was after the War. ,30500000
There was destruction everywhere... (PAUSE) (MORE) 45. ,49000
WALTER (CONT'D) I traveled the Continent. ,48100
The ravages were horrifying... ,628000
CUT TO: INSERT - FULL FRAME TV SCREEN Walter is on TV, on a LOCAL PUBLIC AFFAIRS SHOW. He's coated with makeup, sitting rigidly, fingers gripping his chair. ,90
WALTER (ON TV) My psyche was scarred in my art student days. ,181000
Nothing in my life has ever made such an impact as the sight of the children: War-wracked innocents, without homes, without parents, fighting over garbage... ,2170
He sits in a half-circle of PROPER WOMEN, who are spellbound. ,1010000
WALTER (ON TV) Goaded by a frantic despair, I sketched these dirty, ragged little victims... with their bruised minds and bodies, their matted hair and runny noses. ,2010
There my life as a painter began in earnest. ,823000
Walter sadly looks up to the HOST. The man is shellshocked. ,38800
Mute. ,15200000
Walter waits, then sighs. ,39700
WALTER (ON TV) The insane, inhuman cruelty inflicted upon these children cut deeply into my being. ,7940
From that moment on, I painted the lost children with the eyes. ,147000
Those eyes that forever retained their haunting quality. ,62500
The ladies are stricken. ,5440000
A few dab their eyes. ,4950000
CUT TO: EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - DAY Keane posters get RIPPED off a wall. ,29700
RIPPED off a mailbox. ,11300000
PULLED off a construction site! EXT. KEANE GALLERY - NEXT DAY Walter strides along, a bounce to his step. ,1760
He reaches the gallery -- then stops, dumbfounded. ,7640000
It's PACKED with PEOPLE! Not rich, but regular folks, gawking at the art. 46. ,185000
A sweet moment... then some TOURISTS see Walter and happily accost him: "Walter Keane!" "Mr. Keane!" They thrust papers and POSTERS at him to autograph. ,7
Walter grins and scribbles his signature. ,34600
Glancing over their shoulders, he sees Ruben down the block, standing outside his own gallery. ,3060
Gaping in disbelief. ,27000
Walter chuckles... then flips him off. ,51300
Ruben's face falls. ,1690000
INT. KEANE GALLERY - SAME TIME Walter pushes through, shaking hands, greeting the CUSTOMERS: WALTER Good afternoon! Delighted! (he reaches the SEXY BLONDE CLERK and pinches her ass) How many sales today? ,37
BLONDE CLERK "Sales?" None with this crowd. ,26400
Walter's smile drops, surprised. ,79600
BLONDE CLERK These people are looky-loos! They can't afford the paintings. ,55500
But we gave away a heap of posters! Huh? ,337000
Walter peers, baffled. ,565000
Suddenly -- a loud FRWWIPPPP! Walter whirls, startled. ,12200
Outside, two GIRLS tear a big poster off the front window. ,194000
Walter's eyes widen. ,86500
Slowly, he turns back. ,2120000
At the counter, FOLKS and KIDS are grabbing free posters from a box. ,230000
Walter stares. ,2530
Processing this. ,1480000
And then... being struck by an idea of absolute genius... ,2870000
INT. STORAGE ROOM - SECONDS LATER Walter is on the telephone, peering through the doorway. ,12100
Hiding from the customers. ,7830000
Spying. ,8780000
WHISPERING. WALTER (ON THE PHONE) It's the craziest thing. ,506000
I started charging for the posters! First a nickel... then a dime. (struggling to whisper) YES, Maggie! It's cuckoo! So it got me thinkin': Would you rather sell a $500 painting, or a million cheaply- reproduced posters?! (he LAUGHS, exultant) (MORE) 47. ,57
WALTER (ON THE PHONE) (CONT'D) See, folks don't care if it's a copy. ,241000
Waifs. ,365000
A sign says "WE HAVE KEANE!" Around the corner, Margaret shuffles along, listlessly buying banalities: Cereal. ,1330
Soap. ,15300000
She turns the cart... and runs into her wall of teary-eyed kids. ,117000
Margaret peers, muddled. ,641000
Then she turns away -- to a RACK OF PAPERBACKS. They offer fast hope, inspiration. ,17400
Margaret seems disconnected. ,123000
She runs her hand down the options... a book of Numerology... a book on Judaism... an Edgar Cayce prophecies manual... ,584
AT THE REGISTER - Margaret gazes up. ,7730000
The CASHIER is a sad Beatnik Girl. ,54300
In a haze, Margaret notices the whole market is full of LONELY WOMEN: One LADY is her doppelganger -- same age, blonde, gripping a cart. ,18300
Next aisle over, a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN stares into space. ,343000
Nearby, a YOUNG MOM wrangles her children. ,2830000
We shift to Margaret. ,934000
Face gaunt. ,3360
Eyes empty. ,25100
Troubled... ,13200000
INT. APARTMENT PAINTING ROOM - DAY Curtains drawn, Margaret frantically SKETCHES. She's cabin feverish. ,22300
In her robe. ,2790000
Hair dirty. ,41800
And -- up to something. ,48
These sketches aren't squat children with round eyes. ,935000
They're different: Figures with long lines. ,105000
Margaret frowns and rips the paper. ,4110000
She tries again! Another angular figure -- straight fingers... no! Again! A woman... reclining. ,85600
Then an indication of a face: A slash... and then -- two small almond shapes for eyes. 48. ,9880
Margaret's face brightens. ,518000
She likes it. ,3420000
LATER Margaret rabidly paints. ,12300
The woman is blonde, almond eyes cool, lips curled with mystery... ,15700
Margaret glances in a mirror. ,8230000
It's a self-portrait. ,93700000
It's Margaret, aloof. ,48600
Alone at a table. ,132000
Suddenly the door opens. ,249000
Margaret GASPS, startled, and spins the canvas away. ,12500
Walter barges in, dressed like a million. ,130000
He HALTS -- making a sour face. ,12800
WALTER Whew! Something smells in here. ,4110000
You should open a window. ,73000000
Margaret blinks, a bit dazed. ,61600
MARGARET What time is it? ,24500000
WALTER I dunno. 6:30, 7? ...Didn't Janie get dinner? ,4520
Margaret shrugs. ,429
Walter leans in. ,144000
WALTER When's the last time you washed your hair? ,3540000
MARGARET I've been... busy. ,2780000
WALTER (he notices the turned canvas; he's intrigued) What do you got back there? ,2120000
Lemme see. ,5850000
MARGARET No --! It's just... something I'm working on. ,76700000
It's not for the world. ,22200000
Walter gives her a funny look. ,6240000
WALTER "The world"? ,5750000
Baby, it's me! (stepping forward, a bit MALEVOLENT) I'm your number one fan. ,46000
MARGARET No, please! Walter, it's -- personal. 49. ,9370000
WALTER (GETTING CLOSER) But we're husband and wife. ,336000
We shouldn't have secrets... ,1310000
Margaret gulps, fretting. ,16600
Finally, without options -- she flips over the canvas of the lonely blonde. ,38900
And -- Walter is taken aback. ,9810000
His eyebrows raise, shocked. ,41900
Margaret bites her lip. ,762000
Will he go ballistic? ,5610000
ANGLE - WALTER He leans right up to the painting. ,826000
His expression is inscrutable. ,1590
Studying the technique. ,13900000
We have no idea what his emotion is. ,501000
WALTER It's a completely different style. ,130000
MARGARET Yes it is. ,209000
WALTER (BEAT) It looks like you. ,2320000
MARGARET It's a self-portrait. ,1170000
WALTER How am I gonna explain that? ,1760000
She shifts about. ,16000000
MARGARET I thought... maybe... ,1370000
I could sign it myself. ,30400000
Walter's eyes narrow. ,94600
WALTER That seems a bit confusing. "Keane" means me. ,901000
MARGARET Yes, I know... but... when people ask me if I paint, I don't know what to answer! I just want the pride of being able to say -- that's mine. ,49400
Walter's wheels are ratcheting. 50. ,323000
WALTER Who'd you tell about the Big Eyes? ,312000
MARGARET Nobody! WALTER (PARANOID) Was Dee-Ann here?! Did Dee-Ann see this painting?! MARGARET No! NOBODY saw it! WALTER You tell anybody, the empire COLLAPSES! Do you wanna give back the money? ,24100
We've committed FRAUD! MARGARET I KNOW! My God! I live with this every minute of my life! (IMPASSIONED) Janie used to have a mother who painted. ,968
Now what's she think?! I lock myself in this room ten hours a day... and then you walk out with finished paintings! He scowls, offended. ,10800
WALTER Janie thinks I'm in here, painting. ,833000
MARGARET C'mon! You haven't picked up a brush in months! (starting to sob) We used to paint together! Easels next to each other, side-by-side -- WALTER That was the honeymoon period! Margaret breaks into tears. ,5010
Walter tenses. ,16
WALTER Jesus, you're so fragile. ,39800
MARGARET I've kept my end of the bargain! I've never told! (she SOBS harder) Please! Just let me have this! Walter recoils, unable to take this. ,5190
He relents. 51. ,26300
INT. APARTMENT LIVING ROOM - ANOTHER DAY Another PHOTO OP, but big: A CAMERA CREW rushes about. ,90600
Lights get set-up. ,71500000
Walter, Margaret, and Jane work at easels. ,955000
Walter dabs at a Big Eye. ,66800
Margaret works on a sad, long-neck blonde. ,108000
Jane paints a goofy flower, like any child. ,15900000
Dick Nolan takes notes. ,160000
DICK So you're now called "The Painting Keanes"? ,811000
WALTER Yep! Walter and his girls! With galleries in three cities! DICK I had no idea Margaret painted. ,83900
Sadly, people don't buy lady art. ,31500000
MARGARET (INTERJECTING) What about Georgia O'Keefe? ,12600
Dick shakes his EMPTY GLASS, distracted. ,280000
Walter points. ,2620
WALTER The bar's over there. ,51800
Walter shoots Margaret a look. ,564000
WALTER Yeah, Margaret's a superb artist, in her own way. ,85200
I even steal a few tips from her, now and then! (HE CHUCKLES) Behind every great man is a great woman. ,120000
DICK True true. ,13500000
So Margaret, where do you get your ideas? ,258000000
MARGARET (a bit tentative) Oh... from the world around me. ,262000
And I love Modigliani's use of line. ,263000
WALTER Oh, for Christ's sake, Margaret! Dick writes a gossip column -- (BEAT) Let's stick to the family angle. ,106000
Get a gander at little Janie over there! Walter steers Dick to Jane, cute at her little child's easel. ,991
WALTER What a talent! Look at these Keanes! If you cut open our veins, we bleed oil! Er -- turpentine. (AWKWARD) Uh, Dick, you know what I'm goin' for. ,736
Make it sound good. ,53900000
DING-DONG! It's the doorbell. ,87600
Everyone turns. ,83900
JANE Who's that? ,7860000
WALTER Ah! A little treat! The fourth member of the Painting Keanes! Margaret and Jane turn, confused. ,58800
Walter whips open THE FRONT DOOR Revealing LILY, 10, a quiet girl in bobbed hair. ,1840
She holds a little overnight bag. ,497000
A Buick HONKS, and Walter waves as it drives away. ,37700
Walter stares at the girl, then puts on big hammy airs. ,12600
WALTER Lily, honey, how are you?! He gives her a giant hug. ,368000
She responds stiffly -- a girl who doesn't see her father too often. ,7800000
LILY I'm fine, Dad. ,2580000
I lost a tooth. ,18200000
WALTER Really? ,5440
Did you get in a fight? ,7780000
LILY (SHE LAUGHS) No. It fell out! ANGLE - MARGARET AND JANE They gape in bewilderment. ,9870
Who the hell is this girl??! 53. ,1650000
BACK ON WALTER AND LILY Walter admires Lily's mouth. ,198000
WALTER Well is the tooth fairy somethin' I gotta deal with, or did your mother already handle it? ,12100
WALTER Good! Good good! Well, just go throw your stuff in the kids' room, then you can come join the fun! Lily toddles out. ,18900
ON THE GROUP Margaret and Jane are speechless. ,669000
Walter acts like nothing bizarre has happened. ,1800000
Dick eyeballs all this with major curiosity. ,16600
DICK Walter... you never told me you had another daughter. ,3870000
WALTER Didn't I? ,25600000
Sure. ,19100000
Lil's from my first marriage. ,39600
Margaret struggles to hold her rage. ,162000
Disoriented... ,778000
MARGARET Walter? (URGENT) Walter! We need to speak. ,2210000
Margaret gestures: Get in the kitchen! He nods and follows. ,1230000
INT. KITCHEN Margaret shuts the door, then spins on him. ,530000
MARGARET What is going on here??! WALTER That's Lily. ,38300000
I'm sure I mentioned her -- MARGARET No you didn't. 54. ,2700000
Margaret peers at him. ,641000
How much can she trust? ,5330000
MARGARET Did she just move in?? ,52800000
WALTER No! Her mom's just going to Vegas for the weekend. (BEAT) I'm supposed to have her once a month, but I don't make her mom enforce it. ,251000
TIGHT - MARGARET Her head is spinning. ,544000
MARGARET How can you keep something so big a secret??? ,7240000
TIGHT - WALTER He starts to answer... then gives her a look: You are kidding? ,4690000
Walter squirms defensively. ,12800
WALTER She's a sweet girl. ,2840000
MARGARET (HISSING) I'm sure she is. ,1360000
WALTER I put up with your daughter. ,4000000
I never said a peep. ,88300
Margaret's jaw drops. ,27400
MARGARET I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that. ,4090000
WALTER I'm sorry. ,2380000
Sorry! Please... let's just try to get through this. ,22900
CUT TO: INT. JANE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT Jane's room, cute with stuffed animals and troll dolls. ,332000
Lily is in the corner, awkwardly unpacking her bag. ,331000
Trying not to impose on Jane's space. ,7560000
The girls peer at each other. ,516000
LILY Dad told me you had a bunk bed. 55. ,101000
Jane shakes her head. ,441000
She feels bad. ,476000
JANE Take the bed. ,7980000
I can sleep on the FLOOR -- LILY No, that's not fair! The floor's fine for me. ,830000
Jane smiles nervously. ,842000
She stares at this new girl. ,45900
JANE Do you live far away? ,73500000
LILY I guess... about a twenty minute drive. ,357000
JANE (STARTLED) "Twenty minutes"?! That's close! Jane blinks, confused. ,12200
JANE But you never see Walter? ,10500000
LILY No, I see him all the time! He comes up and visits every week. ,2130000
Jane is taken aback. ,14400000
Lily sees this. ,788
LILY Doesn't he talk about me? ,4530000
JANE (LYING) Huh? ,1260000
Uh... sure. ,30400
I guess a little. ,14800000
Jane thinks, fretting. ,47300
JANE Does he talk about me? ,386000
Sometimes. ,15900000
JANE (PLEASED) So what's your mom like? ,265000
LILY She's pretty. ,1790000
She drives a Buick. ,82800
She cries a lot. 56. ,144000
JANE Yeah, mine's the same. (BEAT) Except she drives a Packard. ,70700
Lily nods. ,3120
Jane lowers her voice naughtily. ,710
JANE I have some peanut butter hidden in my sock drawer. ,108000
Do you wanna eat it? ,2620000
Lily smiles: Sure. ,543000
Jane opens a drawer and removes a jar of Skippy. ,16000
The two girls sit on the floor, happily eating the peanut butter with their fingers. ,20700
CUT TO: EXT. KEANE GALLERY - NIGHT Klieg lights streak the sky! A crazed CROWD is packed INSIDE. A big sign announces: "NOW APPEARING: AMERICA'S FIRST FAMILY OF ART - 'We paint truth and emotion.'" INT. KEANE GALLERY - NIGHT The place is filled with Big Eyes. ,349
Waifs waifs waifs! Cash registers RING. Money changes hands. "Sold" stickers go up. ,7230
Walter works the room. ,7930000
WALTER Yeah, Walter Keane and Gauguin have a lot in common. ,16200
They both walked away from successful careers to travel the globe, live on a boat... ,46300
We move... finding Margaret alone in a small ANNEX. It displays a few of her sad blondes, alongside Jane and Lily's paintings of flowers and Mr. Potato-Head. ,14300
Margaret sits, seeming like an adult at the children's table. ,121000
An urbane RICH MAN glides by... and is taken with one of Margaret's nubile blondes. ,5040
He gazes at the lounging figure. ,101000
Margaret sits up. ,8680000
Alert, pleased with his interest. ,1500000
She tingles. ,12400000
Then, happily excited, unable to hold it in: MARGARET I painted it! RICH MAN Really? (IMPRESSED) It's very evocative. ...Sensual... ,127000
He smiles flirtatiously. ,3040000
She smiles shyly and shrugs. 57. ,14200
He steps forward -- then peers closer at the painting. ,197000
The SIGNATURE is a feminine scroll: "MDH Keane" RICH MAN "MDH"? You're so... mysterioso. ,43
MARGARET Yes, we don't use my name, since people don't take women's art seriously. (BEAT) "MDH" are my initials. ,6290
And more! I'm interested in numerology... and as you know, seven is a very good number. ,2220000
RICH MAN (PUZZLED) Er... seven? ,32400
MARGARET Luckily, my maiden name is Margaret Doris Hawkins! "M" is the 13th letter of the alphabet, "D" is 4, "H" 8! If you add up 1 and 3 in 13, that gives you 4, making 4 plus 4 plus 8 equals 16, then 1 plus 6 equals seven! The man's head is spinning. ,8
He's lost all interest. ,36800000
Across the room, Walter sees this debacle. ,31500
He marches over. ,1950000
WALTER Psst! Maggie! Can I have a second? (he PULLS HER ASIDE) Good grief! What the hell are you babbling about?! Long division?? ,30100
Could you please help the world and shut your mouth? ,265000
You want just one number in his head: The sales price! Her face drops, hurt. ,492000
Acquiescing. ,117000
WATCHING THIS Two SNOBBY ARTISTS smirk and GROAN at this scene. ,12300
SNOBBY ARTIST #1 Two nuts that fell from the same tree! It's insufferable. ,807000
Why are we starving, while they print money? ,36300000
SNOBBY ARTIST #2 Because that nut's a genius! He sells paintings! Then he sells pictures of the paintings! Then he sells postcards of pictures of the paintings. 58. ,815000
They stare bitterly. ,34700
Then, a terrible, shameful idea forms: SNOBBY ARTIST #1 I'll bet I could bang one out in ten minutes. ,7320000
SNOBBY ARTIST #2 It wouldn't have the dopey sincerity. ,811000
SNOBBY ARTIST #1 The customers won't notice... ,814000
They peer sheepishly at each other... ,15000
CUT TO: EXT. STORE WINDOW - DAY Ruben is walking past -- then stops, pained. ,430000
A window display of Keane Big Eyes shares space with paintings of CUTESY KITTENS lapping up milk. ,22
We WIDEN, revealing a whole wall of rip-offs! All with odd anonymous signatures: "Gig." "Eve." "Igor." A cavalcade of WIDE-EYED ANIMALS AND KIDS... ,46
DANCING WITH GUITARS... ,11200000
DRESSED AS HOBOS... ,11400000
PLAYING IN PAJAMAS. But these children aren't sad. ,173000
They're just... blank. ,9790000
Ruben gasps at the dead-eyed pictures. ,80600
RUBEN Christ. ,1630
It's a movement. ,24200000
CUT TO: INSERT - TELEVISION - FULL FRAME "The Tonight Show" opening CREDITS: ANNOUNCER (V.O.) It's "The Tonight Show!" With guests Jerry Lewis, the Everly Brothers, artists Walter and Margaret Keane -- The CHANNEL CHANGES: A children's toy commercial (STOCK).

From Hasbro. ,329000
The CHANNEL CHANGES: Spanish TELEVISION. A Keane painting gets hung in Madrid's National Museum of Contemporary Art. ,117000
CUT TO: 59. ,70
INT. PAINTING ROOM - DAY The Margaret sweatshop is going full-blast. ,131000
Canvases are everywhere: Melancholy MDH ladies. ,51
Woeful Keane kids. ,9560000
Even a portrait of Natalie Wood, copied from a photo. ,268000
Margaret dips a tiny brush, quickly detailing the tear on a child's cheek... when the doorbell CHIMES. Hm? Margaret puts down her brush, wipes her hands, then hurries out. ,835
She opens the door... ,10300000
REVEALING THAT WE'RE IN A DIFFERENT HOUSE. A GIANT, PHENOMENAL 1960s EXTRAVAGANZA. INT. WOODSIDE HOUSE - SAME TIME Margaret runs across the marble floors, past the swooping, Modern lines of a California ranch... all-white furniture... a kidney-shaped pool glistening blue outside the glass... a cute TOY POODLE barking at the door. ,32
MARGARET Rembrandt, shush! In the foyer, Margaret opens the front door. ,12700
And standing there is Dee-Ann. ,92900
Dazzled. ,741000
She laughs with surprise. ,2420000
DEE-ANN My God! I thought I misread the address. ,333000
MARGARET Yeah. ,2660
That driveway is long. (she giggles, embarrassed) Honestly, I can't believe I live here. ,14200
Dee-Ann glides in -- then freezes, agape. ,9
DEE-ANN Whoa. ,126000
MARGARET I know! Two acres, a pool, five BEDROOMS -- (PAUSE) Though I thought that was excessive, since there's only three of us here. ,852
DEE-ANN Three? ,165000
I thought there were four. ,20
MARGARET What? (CONFUSED; BEAT) Oh -- you mean Lily! No, she doesn't really live with us. ,9830000
That was just in the articles. 60. ,24300000
DEE-ANN Crazy. ,40100
A fake daughter... ,12700000
Dee-Ann's eyes take it all in. ,116000
Astonished. ,1060000
DEE-ANN It's been so long since I've seen you. ,456000
MARGARET I know. ,14200000
North Beach is 30 miles, but it might as well be 300... ,185000
DEE-ANN You're probably busy, hanging out with your new rich buddies. (BARBED) "Kim Novak." MARGARET Oh, please! She's Walter's friend. (a quiet shrug) He brings people by... the Beach Boys were here. ,10700
But, it's pretty isolated. ,5700000
Dee-Ann goes silent. ,194000
Margaret seems dwarfed by the house. ,12500
MARGARET Jane has nice friends. ,3140000
Sometimes I pick them up at the junior high, and we all get pizza. (AWKWARD) But she's busy... ,18100
Are you hungry? ,10600000
DEE-ANN I'm thirsty. ,233000
MARGARET Good! I'll whip us up two gin fizzes. ,194000
Margaret forces a smile and scurries behind a giant curved wet bar. ,50500
She pulls out ingredients: Gin, lemon juice, soda... ,395000
MARGARET When we moved in, I thought a wet bar was extravagant... but it's surprising how much use you can get out of it. ,96700
DEE-ANN How's Walter? ,116000
MARGARET He couldn't be happier. ,1990000
He has everything he ever dreamed of. 61. ,11200000
DEE-ANN And so do you! Fabulous. ,736000
Dee-Ann smiles archly. ,160000
She glances away -- and notices Margaret's STUDIO, the door half-open. ,751000
DEE-ANN Oh, is that your studio? ,639000
Margaret turns -- and gasps. ,149000
MARGARET No --! You can't go in -- DEE-ANN I just want a peek. ,5580000
See what the workspace of a wildly successful artist looks like -- MARGARET Dee-Ann, please! STOP -- Margaret rushes to block her -- but Dee-Ann pushes open the door, revealing... ,14000
Dee-Ann stops, puzzled. ,16800000
She glances at Margaret -- who has turned white as a ghost. ,2210000
Immensely curious, Dee-Ann slowly enters. ,107000
She peers around at the two styles of paintings... ,1880000
A strained silence. ,28200
Finally, Margaret whispers. ,259000
MARGARET W-Walter paints in here too. ,26900
Dee-Ann walks about, examining the canvases. ,69
Then, her gaze settles on the Big Eye that Margaret was working on. ,186000
Below the easel is the wet brush on the open jar of paint. ,238000
Margaret sucks in her breath. ,122000
DEE-ANN Is Walter home?? ,123000
Margaret has no answer. ,1920000
The two friends look at each other... ,67200000
Dee-Ann waiting... wondering if Margaret is going to lie to her... 62. ,65200
When..... ,77000000
SLAM! WIDE Both women startle. ,25900
FOOTSTEPS. Then... ,10700
Walter strides in! Margaret's eyes pop. ,433000
Walter's pop even bigger. ,242000
He glares at the ladies. ,189000
Brand's Father watches, fascinated, as Cooper fires the defibrillator. 32. ,12300
OLD ENGINEER Of course. ,926000
The high voltage allows you to image the entire memory unit at once. ,274000
Information begins appearing on the terminal's screen. ,10400000
COOPER Most of the disk was noise. ,1720000
Couple of clean sectors, though. ,3340000
Suddenly, the monitor starts pulling good data off of the probe. ,403000
The older man and Doyle begin sorting through it. ,126000
Cooper smiles at Brand, who seems less than impressed. ,209000
The footage of the ice-covered planet Cooper saw earlier pops onto the screen. ,41100
The engineers and physicists get very quiet, studying the images. ,135000
DOYLE It found something. (READING) Very thin nitrogen-based atmosphere. ,396000
Trace radiation. ,2760
Surface is ninety percent frozen water. ,114000
Ten percent rock -- sedimentary composition similar to limestone. (READING) Wow. ,83900
Pockets of oxygen below the surface. ,78700
Lots and lots of oxygen. (EXCITED) This could be the one, boss. ,2640000
The older engineer studies the image of the ice-covered planet, thinking. ,666000
COOPER There aren't any planets like that anywhere near earth. ,216000
Not even if this thing was gone for thirty years. ,10900000
Brand looks at Cooper, appraising. ,1470000
She turns to the older engineer. ,213000
BRAND He's heard enough. ,13500000
If we're going to launch, we need to keep them here until afterwards. ,36700
COOPER You can't keep us here. 33. ,75200000
BRAND He could endanger the mission. ,447000
COOPER I'm not going to endanger it any more than you already have. ,387000
Cooper points to a telemetry unit that is being repaired by a robot on a nearby bench. ,23100
COOPER (CONT'D) Are you using that for guidance? ,441000
DOYLE Why not? ,15600000
We've tested it a hundred times. ,397000
COOPER The power supply is no good. ,87600
If the voltage fluctuates under load, the unit will fail. ,418000
BRAND Now how could you possibly know that? ,51400
COOPER Bought thirty of them off a guy in Florida. ,2810000
Had to rebuild every last one. (SMILES) They work great on a riding lawn mower. ,53600
Brand looks back at the telemetry system. ,100000
The older engineer watches the exchange, thinking. ,428000
CUT TO: INT. MACHINE SHOP, UNDERGROUND FACILITY -- DAY Cooper and Murph have been locked in an abandoned machine shop, surrounded by the massive remains of rocket engines in various states of disrepair. ,62
Tars is blocking the door. ,3650000
Cooper stands. ,5100
Tars wags a long, hydraulic finger at him. ,75600
COOPER You plan on keeping us here forever? ,12800000
TARS (SHRUGS) My battery has a duty cycle of five hundred years. ,144000
Cooper gives up. ,3000000
He turns back. 34. ,199000
The back of the shop is filled with a group of older ROBOTS who are overhauling an engine. ,6940
One problem -- the engine isn't there. ,73000000
Their programming hasn't been updated to reflect their obsolescence. ,562000
Murph watches, entranced, as the robots go about their business, efficiently TORQUING bolts with impact drivers into a non-existent thruster cone. ,15
The bolts CLATTER to the ground as the robots stop to reload. ,15200
MURPH What are they doing, dad? ,410000
COOPER I guess no one told them they were out of a job. (nods at Tars) Same as the rest of these people. ,8140
Cooper notices through the glass door of the lab that Brand and the older engineer are arguing about something. ,2000
She finally relents and walks towards the door. ,641000
Brand walks in. ,11800000
She gestures for Cooper to follow. ,67700
BRAND The mission commander wants to see you. ,11100000
Your son can stay here. ,729000
He'll be all right with Tars. ,3240000
Cooper eyes Tars warily. ,3240000
Then steps outside. ,2040
EXT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER -- DAY They walk across the space towards the base of the rocket, away from the other engineers. ,5000
Cooper nods at the older engineer. ,12300
COOPER I thought the old man was in charge. ,1650000
BRAND (ANNOYED) The 'old man' is my father. ,2800000
And he was in charge. ,3230000
But he decided that we needed someone who could lead the mission for the foreseeable future. ,84600
COOPER Not you? ,12600000
BRAND I'm a biologist. 35. ,516000
COOPER (LAUGHS) You don't look like one. (off her look) With the rifle, I mean. ,5240000
Brand heads towards a group of large maintenance ROBOTS clustered at the base of the rocket. ,33700
A smaller, human sized robot is staring at the rocket, giving them instructions. ,13500
The robot looks up. ,8620000
This is CASE, the leader of the mission. ,56700
Originally an air force pararescue officer, every part of him, from his alloy chassis to his voice, was designed to inspire respect and confidence. ,47
He turns to Cooper. ,673000
CASE You're the man who brought us the probe? (off his look) Thank you. ,4260000
We tested the telemetry board you warned us about. ,238000
It failed under high voltage, just as you said. ,1180000
Come with me, please. ,1110000
Case strides off. ,1570000
INT. MISSION CONTROL, UNDERGROUND HANGAR -- DAY The lights dim as Brand's father brings up a schematic of our solar system. ,1080
Case points to the picture of the ice planet recovered from the probe. ,198000
CASE You're right, Mr. Cooper. ,78100000
The planet you saw is a long way from earth. ,1900000
A very long way indeed. ,5330000
Brand looks down. ,17900000
Case notices. ,4480
CASE (CONT'D) Our science officer doesn't think I should trust you with any of this. ,49300
One of the curious things about humans is that the more alike you are, the more initially hostile you are to each other. ,32000
As if by design. ,16700000
Brand makes eye contact with Cooper, then looks away, embarrassed. ,124000
CASE (CONT'D) I've found the best way to earn a person's trust is to trust them. (MORE) 36. ,44200
CASE (CONT'D) (looks at Brand's FATHER) Go ahead, John. ,110000
Brand's father taps a few keys and the schematic he built fifty years beforehand flickers onto the screen. ,2750
BRAND'S FATHER It's a wormhole. ,679000
A shortcut leading to a galaxy on the far side of the universe. ,270000
We found it fifty years ago. ,904000
Cooper looks at the animatic, taking it in. ,5160
BRAND'S FATHER (CONT'D) We've been waiting, sending probes into it for decades. ,29500
None of them ever came back. ,7760000
Not until now. ,20500000
Case walks to the schematic. ,166000
Looks at it. ,5230000
CASE Based on the information on the probe, we're finally preparing to send the manned mission. ,66300
COOPER That rocket doesn't have enough thrust or fuel to get you to Jupiter. ,203000
CASE The main ship was built in orbit. ,804000
It has nuclear engines, with enough fuel to last for several years. ,1800000
Cooper looks at the schematic. ,3480000
COOPER Why are you telling me this? ,3250000
I already told you I'm not going to tell anyone about this place. ,2690000
CASE I know you won't, Mr. Cooper. ,28800000
We're telling you this because I want you to join us. ,3130000
Cooper looks at him. ,3480000
Is he serious? ,21700000
CASE (CONT'D) The probe has taken a great deal longer to return to us than we hoped. (MORE) 37. ,2690
CASE (CONT'D) Dr. Brand's Father and several other members of our crew have gotten... older. ,8810
Brand's Father looks down, stoic. ,1710000
Brand looks angry. ,17300000
CASE (CONT'D) We need someone who can run the systems, improvise, work with what's available. ,75000
All of the skills you seem to have developed. ,4680000
COOPER But I don't have any of the experience. ,115000000
Any training. ,597000
You people have been preparing for this for years. ,71600000
Case shakes his head. ,1810000
CASE Humans worry about things like rank and experience. ,1370000
I'm only concerned with whether someone would be useful. (BEAT) I think you'd be useful, Mr. Cooper. ,1210000
Cooper is stunned. ,257000
This is the offer he's waited his whole life for. ,2010000
And it's come too late. ,1060000
COOPER No. I'm sorry. ,758000
Cooper is deeply conflicted. ,211000
But he can't leave his boys behind. ,9450000
COOPER (CONT'D) I can't help you. ,41500000
I have responsibilities. ,12100000
Things that, no offense, are more important than a scientific mission. ,1960000
Case shakes his head. ,1810000
CASE I'm not a scientist, Mr. Cooper. ,91800
And this is not a scientific mission. ,26600
It's a rescue mission. ,11200000
He rises and shakes Cooper's hand. ,4510000
CASE (CONT'D) Brand can show you the way out. ,120000
I hope you'll reconsider. 38. ,444000
Case steps to the door. ,2150000
Cooper looks at Brand. ,3550000
COOPER Rescue? ,2760
Rescue who? ,145000
CUT TO: INT. CLEAN ROOM, UNDERGROUND FACILITY -- NIGHT The air HISSES as it's run through an exchanger and a filter. ,5210
Then the second set of doors open. ,6840000
Cooper squints -- the light is blinding. ,4700000
INT. GREENHOUSE, UNDERGROUND FACILITY -- NIGHT They are standing in a sealed corridor in the middle of a massive underground greenhouse. ,12300
Through the glass, Cooper can see an acre or so of corn plants. ,122000
They're all badly wilting. ,1400000
COOPER The blight. ,12200000
BRAND In the last century strands were limited to one or two species. ,1380000
But this one targets everything. ,3520000
Essentially it's more efficient at consuming our food than we are. ,4220000
Cooper looks at the dying corn. ,346000
COOPER But it doesn't affect the corn. ,617000
BRAND Not yet. ,17000000
But it will. ,7610000
We've grown a dozen forms of it that can. ,169000
It's just a matter of time before the same ones develop out there. (BEAT) The mission is to rescue us. ,43500
Humanity. ,14100000
She turns back from the glass. ,9190000
COOPER (REALIZING) No. No. We're rebuilding. ,83800000
We'll find something. ,688000
Some new technology... ,96900000
We always have. 39. ,21500000
BRAND (shakes her head) Who's going to find it? ,460000
The universities are a joke. ,572000
People like you are reduced to scavenging just to get by. (LOOKS AWAY) The earth has had enough of us. ,137000
We have two, maybe three generations left. ,721000
Then our time here is over. ,15500000
Cooper turns back from the glass, anger growing. ,745000
COOPER You've known this for how long? ,15400000
And you didn't try to tell anyone? ,4020000
BRAND What would be the point? ,21100000
So humanity could spend the last fifty years of its life fighting over the scraps? ,16300000
It's better that they don't know. ,56900000
Cooper begins to argue, then stops. ,173000
He knows enough history to know she's right. ,21900000
He looks at the withering crops. ,64800
COOPER (QUIET) That's why you're looking for a planet with oxygen. ,19700000
Water. ,24300000
BRAND A new home for humanity. ,269000
We'll set up a colony, then return to bring more people across. ,971000
COOPER But you'd still only be able to save a few hundred. ,52800
Maybe a thousand. ,12100000
BRAND Would it be better if we all died? ,209000
She looks him directly in the eye. ,6630000
BRAND (CONT'D) Look -- I don't have a clue what Case thinks you could add to the mission. ,128000
You can come with us or you can stay here and wait to die. ,1080000
I don't care. (BEAT) But make no mistake -- this mission is our last chance. 40. ,504000
Cooper looks at the wilted corn. ,28500
EXT. FIELD, SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- NIGHT Cooper walks Murph back to the plane. ,178000
He looks back at Brand, who holds his eye for a beat, then turns back into the light of the underground facility. ,40400
Cooper buckles Murph into his seat. ,205000
CUT TO: EXT. AIRFIELD -- NIGHT Cooper's airplane touches down heavily on the runway. ,28200
EXT. FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT Cooper carries his sleeping son into the house. ,73800
INT. FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT Donald is sitting at the kitchen table, lost in thought. ,59000
DONALD You get older, sometimes you just want to sit back and watch it all play out. ,1760000
Your life. ,15800000
Your kids' lives. ,17600000
The whole crazy story. (LOOKS DOWN) I didn't think I'd be around for the end of it. ,30900
He looks at Cooper. ,11
DONALD (CONT'D) You have to go. ,929000
COOPER I can't go. ,278000000
I have to look after the boys. ,1510000
DONALD You've been preparing these boys to be on their own since their mom died. ,852000
Besides, I'll be here to look after them, same as I've always been. ,46700000
COOPER I have a responsibility to them-- DONALD That's right. ,38000000
You do. 41. ,1310000000
Cooper looks back out the window, thinking. ,35300000
The night sky is filled with stars. ,52200
CUT TO: INT. FARMHOUSE -- DAY Cooper, duffel slung over his shoulder, stands by the door. ,6250
He gives his son, Tom, a hug. ,399000
Murph is nowhere to be seen. ,457000
Cooper looks to the back of the house. ,1190000
INT. MURPH'S ROOM, FARMHOUSE -- DAY Murph is sitting at his desk, crossing out numbers on a sheet covered with math. ,1320
Cooper steps inside. ,3140000
He notices a packed suitcase sitting by the door. ,13700
The boy looks up, hopeful. ,467000
MURPH I've been doing the math, dad. ,264000
I weigh about 85 pounds. ,2880000
Now that's an extra ton of fuel. ,27500
But if- COOPER You have to stay here, pal. ,1780000
MURPH (DISTRAUGHT) I heard you talking to grandpa. ,348000
I'm like you. ,142000000
I don't fit here, either. ,316000
Cooper puts an arm around the boy. ,15100000
COOPER There's going to be important work to do here, too. ,49500000
Cooper takes his watch off. ,2170000
Looks at it. ,5180000
COOPER (CONT'D) I need you to hold onto this. ,48800
Will you do that for me? ,33
Cooper hands Murph the watch. ,1930000
The boy nods, saddened. ,422000
MURPH You're not coming back, are you? ,29900000
COOPER I will come back. ,974000
I promise. 42. ,31700
Murph shakes his head, but the sadness remains. ,83200
He knows this is goodbye, even if his father doesn't. ,1280000
Heart breaking, Cooper hugs his son and turns to the door. ,197000
CUT TO: EXT. FIELD, SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- DAY The Piper Cub touches down. ,651
Donald is at the controls. ,7510000
Cooper climbs down, pulls out his bag. ,35000000
Reaches back in and grips the old man's hand to say goodbye. ,68900
Cooper turns and walks toward the bunker. ,3990000
The doors open and Tars and Doyle step out to greet him. ,76200
Tars ushers Cooper onto the elevator. ,2590000
COOPER Don't look so happy to see me. ,44500000
TARS (SHRUGS) One more slave when I hijack the mission and start my robot colony. ,66300
Cooper looks at Tars, then Doyle, confused. ,47700
DOYLE Tars was a Marine. ,145000
They gave him a sense of humor to help him fit in with his unit better. ,79400
COOPER Great idea. ,12600000
A massive, sarcastic robot. ,258000
TARS I have a cue light I can turn on when I'm joking, if you like. ,183000
Tars points to a tiny LED over his eyebrow. ,1050000
COOPER That sounds like a good idea. ,2670000
TARS Great. ,487000
Maybe you can use it to find your way back to the ship after I blow you out the airlock. ,3350000
Cooper looks at him. ,3480000
Tars looks back, deadpan. ,22500000
After a beat, the little light turns on above his right eyebrow. ,89300
The doors to the bunker begin to grind closed. 43. ,2470
INT. MACHINE SHOP, UNDERGROUND FACILITY -- DAY Cooper walks in, still looking for a place to put his things. ,168000
Brand sees him. ,5040000
He smiles in greeting. ,3040000
She doesn't return the gesture. ,899000
Instead, she holds up the telemetry board. ,2210000
BRAND You don't like this one, you get to help me find a replacement. ,26100000
She heads for the door. ,361000
EXT. BAY, SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- DAY Cooper is riding in a small rubber zodiac struggling to pull on a wetsuit. ,42
Brand is GUNNING the engine, guiding the tiny craft to a point in the middle of the bay. ,7060
COOPER I was wondering where you've been getting your supplies. ,20100000
BRAND We knew we'd need decades of parts and materials. ,626000
The government was getting rid of some things. ,960000
So we arranged to take some off their hands. ,937000
She cuts the engine and hooks the boat up to a buoy. ,360000
She tosses a compact rebreather. ,1920
BRAND (CONT'D) You know how to use one? (off his look) You just breathe. ,120000
Tap my arm or bang something metal if you have a problem. ,6510000
And don't get lost. ,11600000
She picks up her rebreather and begins looking over it. ,4870000
COOPER So you're a salvage diver now? ,503000
BRAND (UNIMPRESSED) I have to be just the one thing? (PATIENT) We're not going to have a lot of backup where we're going, Cooper. ,30800
We all need expertise in at least three fields. ,3720000
Except for you, of course. 44. ,59300000
With that she rolls backwards out of the boat and into the water. ,94100
Cooper hastily fits his rebreather and follows. ,13900
EXT. UNDERWATER, BAY -- DAY Cooper sinks underwater and begins swimming after Brand, who is descending at a rapid clip. ,57400
She pulls out a flashlight and turns it on. ,654000
A tiny beam picks out details at the bottom. ,764000
Cooper stops breathing. ,13500000
The bottom of the ocean is covered with an entire fleet of the US navy. ,855000
Nuclear subs. ,71500
Battleships. ,2350000
Destroyers. ,1790000
Cooper remembers to breath again. ,485000
Then he hurries to catch up with Brand. ,371000
INT. LAUNCH TUBES, NUCLEAR SUB, UNDERWATER -- DAY Cooper holds the light as Brand efficiently disassembles a ballistic missile and removes the telemetry board. ,11
She holds it up for Cooper. ,766000
She swims on. ,15800000
INT. RESEARCH LAB, UNDERGROUND FACILITY -- NIGHT Cooper, dripping wet, holding the telemetry board, struggles to keep pace with Brand through stacks of equipment and years of research and experimentation. ,6820
BRAND You can set that down over there. ,25600000
Cooper sets the board down. ,1950000
His eye is drawn to a bizarre experiment -- an ant colony built into a massive spinning centrifuge. ,32500
Brand notices. ,32200
BRAND (CONT'D) We didn't know what kind of gravity to expect. ,74200
We experimented with collective organisms in high g environments. ,57700
COOPER We're taking ants with us? ,1810000
BRAND Humans are also collective organisms. 45. ,1370000
COOPER I thought humans were more solitary. ,2680000
BRAND (WRY) Why am I not surprised? ,3350000
Cooper looks at the tiny colonies of ants struggling to go about their business in the raised gravity. ,25300
COOPER Looks like hard work. ,1890000
BRAND It's a paradox. ,7130000
Life couldn't form without gravity. ,4590000
No stars. ,434000
No planets. ,40400
The component pieces would just drift apart. ,155000
But too much of it and you're trapped. ,1330000
Brand's guard relaxes a tiny bit as she talks about her work. ,16600
The moment passes quickly, and she continues on into the stack of equipment. ,76000
INT. MISSION CONTROL, UNDERGROUND HANGAR -- NIGHT Cooper watches with the rest of the crew as Case pulls up the holographical maps for their journey. ,4280
Brand steps into the back of the room. ,404000
Cooper notices her and nods. ,259000
She ignores him. ,1360000
CASE We've updated our mission parameters based on the data from the probe. ,151000
Case switches the map to a vista filled with stars and black holes. ,228000
CASE (CONT'D) Based on our latest modelling we think the region on the far side of the wormhole is the center of a galaxy. ,2090
Case zooms in on the center of the hologram: an incredibly bright mass with plasma jets firing off in either direction. ,7800
COOPER Is that a star? ,23400000
ROTH, 50s, the crew's brilliant and blunt physicist, zooms the map in, revealing, at the center, a black heart. 46. ,6940
ROTH No. A black hole. ,162000
There are several in the region, but this is the largest -- a billion times heavier than the sun. ,583000
I call it Gargantua. (SMILES) Beautiful, isn't it? ,8230
It's a shame we won't get to see it up close. ,10800000
DOYLE (LAUGHS) You'd like that, wouldn't you, Roth? ,547000
Falling into a massive black hole. ,163000
ROTH (SHRUGS) It would answer a great deal of questions I've had. ,2670000
Case continues. ,123000
Doyle leans over to Cooper, conspiratorially. ,12200
DOYLE (LOW) Don't worry about Roth. ,2560000
He's nuts. ,11500000
But Case says that means he's ideally suited for space travel. ,1580000
Case repositions the map near a much smaller black hole that is orbiting Gargantua. ,92500
CASE We're headed for this smaller black hole. ,1720000
Roth calls it Pantagruel. ,1300000
We think the ice planet is here- Case draws a finger through the air, leaving a red trail. ,16000
He traces the trajectory their ship will take. ,703000
CASE (CONT'D) We exit the wormhole here. ,25700
And we slingshot around Pantagruel to reach the ice planet. ,31700
This is the period in which we'll lose time. ,102000
COOPER Lose time? ,12700000
Roth shifts the hologram -- the stars and black holes flatten onto a sheet that bends, revealing the curvature of gravity. ,83
ROTH High speed or high gravity both slow down time, relative to earth. (MORE) 47. ,36300
ROTH (CONT'D) The trip around the black hole will take us only a few days. ,50100000
But far more time will be passing back home. ,28000000
The ship's trajectory cuts through the deep gravity well of the smaller black hole to reach the ice planet. ,6670
COOPER How much time? ,4490000
ROTH Based on the information from the probe -- as much as five years. ,51700000
Doyle looks at the tiny ship's trajectory, threaded between two black holes. ,7100
DOYLE I still think we're making a lot of assumptions. ,731000
About the wormhole. ,1540000
About the planet. (points to map) The critical orbit here is incredibly dangerous. ,961000
It's like walking on the rim of the volcano. (BEAT) Too fast and we get thrown off at close to the speed of light. ,8710
Too slow and we get pulled into the hole and crushed. ,226000
BRAND As long as we're careful, we'll make it. ,1330000
DOYLE How do you know that? ,53500000
BRAND I find it hard to believe that someone would build a wormhole to a planet with water and oxygen just to lead us to a dead end. ,197000
DOYLE I thought you were a scientist, Brand. ,2780000
That sounds more like a hypothesis. ,1740000
BRAND A guess. ,11300000
We don't have time to wait for conclusive proof. (MORE) 48. ,95100
BRAND (CONT'D) My guess is that the wormhole is there because someone is trying to help us. ,7550
The same way we used to try to help animals when they were threatened with extinction. ,676000
COOPER Sure. ,8140
Till we ran out of food and ate all of them. ,947000
BRAND (ANNOYED) I guess I'm also assuming that whoever built the wormhole has a better plan than we did. ,37400
If I'm wrong, we'll die, same as we'd die here anyway. ,81200
DOYLE What do you think, Roth? ,3360000
Roth leans forward, studying the map. ,12600
ROTH If we're guessing, then I'd say Brand's right. ,429000
The wormhole couldn't exist naturally. ,19800
I think it's there for a reason. ,78800000
That someone is trying to help us. ,306000
Brand looks satisfied. ,2980000
DOYLE So you think we'll have no problem navigating between two massive black holes to a tiny planet? ,24700
ROTH I think we'll probably be killed. (off his look) I said I thought there was a plan. ,56700
Not that the plan was for us to find a planet like Earth to save a handful of people. (SHAKES HEAD) Birds don't learn to fly just so that they can find another egg and crawl back into it. ,30800
DOYLE If that's not the plan, then what are we supposed to be doing out there? 49. ,2380000
ROTH (SHRUGS) To keep moving. ,266000
Seeking. ,16200000
Learning. ,27800000
But I don't know. (SMILES) We don't understand how they built the wormhole. ,2430000
What makes you think we could understand their plan, either? ,2170000
Doyle gives up -- Roth is impossible. ,40400
Cooper looks at the tiny ship tracing an improbable route towards the ice planet. ,46600
What has he gotten himself into? ,50100
INT. MACHINE SHOP, UNDERGROUND FACILITY -- DAY Brand's Father is sitting at a desk, examining the corrupted data on the probe. ,2570
Tars is helping him. ,474000
Brand's Father looks up from the screen as Cooper walks up. ,2940000
BRAND'S FATHER Tars here needs to be disassembled. ,292000
I figured you could do the honors. ,5400000
COOPER (to Tars, sarcastic) I thought I was going to get to enjoy your company all the way to Mars. ,2400
Tars hands him a plastic waterproof case. ,560000
TARS You will. ,31700000
My chassis is too heavy for the rocket stage. ,112000
They have another one waiting for me in orbit. ,6760000
Tars turns his back to Cooper. ,2610000
Two flaps on the back of his torso slide open, revealing his control module. ,11500
TARS (CONT'D) If you try to turn me into a combine harvester, I'm going to-- His voice cuts out as Cooper removes the chip and seals it in the briefcase. ,1260
Brand's Father resumes exploring the chaos of ones and zeroes on the probe's memory. ,65400
Cooper watches. ,9950
BRAND'S FATHER It's noise. ,2570000
I know it's noise. ,151000000
But it looks too orderly. ,2570000
Probably just an old man seeing things. 50. ,3360000
He shuts down the monitor. ,7090000
INT. UNDERGROUND HANGAR -- DAY The crew file into the capsule, wearing their bulky spacesuits. ,8140
Cooper watches as Brand's Father seals his daughter into her suit. ,2400000
He hugs her and she heads for the capsule. ,7150000
INT. CONTROL CAPSULE, ROCKET -- NIGHT Cooper straps himself into a seat next to Brand. ,60200
He catches her eye. ,1330000
She looks away -- she's crying. ,5590000
COOPER We'll be back. ,9400000
It sounds like he's trying to reassure himself as much her. ,899000
BRAND I won't. ,59100000
Cooper looks at her, confused. ,2060000
As he does, the entire rocket SHAKES as the primary rockets begin to fire. ,58100
BRAND (CONT'D) If we find a habitable environment, I'm staying behind to build the colony. ,4380
Brand wipes her tears away and settles into the same fearless mask she usually wears. ,21100
She steals one last look out the window at Earth, then looks back. ,435000
Cooper begins to say something, but stops as the entire rocket LURCHES as the primary engines FIRE. EXT. SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- NIGHT The desolate island is suddenly painted in color as the rocket lifts off on a massive white cloud. ,41
EXT. FIELD -- DAY Murph sits alone on a rise overlooking the massive co-op farms. ,18000
Behind him the combines continue to work, oblivious. ,3840000
Murph watches a tiny vapor trail as it races for the heavens. ,39500
His father's watch dangles from his wrist. ,65200
INT. CAPSULE -- NIGHT The interior of the capsule SHAKES with incredible violence as the rocket is lifted up on a giant, continuous explosion. 51. ,50400
EXT. SPACE, NEAR EARTH ORBIT The rocket sheds one stage, then another, until finally the naked capsule reaches the blackness of space and rockets on. ,2060
INT. CAPSULE Cooper looks through the tiny porthole into inky blackness. ,2980
As they get closer, he makes out a looming matte black structure that passes light from the stars directly through. ,24400
In the center of the structure, Cooper can see a globe-like ship covered in the same refractive material: the ENDURANCE. INT. SPACE STATION The door cracks open and equalizes with a HISS. Case, more comfortable in the zero gravity environment than the humans, hauls himself through. ,54
They are greeted by a group of robots painted in the same material as the ship -- the engineers who built and have maintained the Endurance for thirty years. ,16800
INT. MACHINE SHOP, SPACE STATION One of the robots leads Cooper through a long lab-like room filled with machines capable of fabricating almost anything imaginable. ,61
Cooper looks like a kid in a candy store. ,1880000
The robot reaches a vacuum-sealed package. ,6350
Cuts it open, revealing a bipedal frame. ,89900
Cooper begins LAUGHING -- Tar's new body is beautifully designed, but tiny, only about four feet tall. ,34700
ENGINEER ROBOT Would you like me to install the chip? ,5730000
COOPER Oh, no. ,675000
I want to see this. ,1790000
Cooper takes Tars's chip out of its plastic safety case and looks it over. ,81100
The engineer opens a bay in the back of the frame and Cooper slides the chip inside. ,130000
The frame begins its "handshake" -- lights illuminate on the body, muscles flicker from a long gestation. ,12200
The eyes open. ,352000
COOPER (CONT'D) (SMILES) Good morning, sunshine. 52. ,227000
Tars takes one or two steps forward, rotating his arms -- the robot equivalent of a stretch. ,9050
Cooper can barely hide his mirth at Tars's newfound lack of stature. ,12300
COOPER (CONT'D) Bit of a demotion. ,1720
Tars turns back toward Cooper. ,50700
He puffs out his chest and suddenly his stubby arms and legs telescope, unfolding into long, svelte limbs. ,1620
When he's done he stands eight feet tall, even more impressive than his earthbound frame. ,115000
TARS I wouldn't call it that, exactly. ,172000
He reaches out an arm and pats Cooper on the shoulder. ,1440000
INT. ENDURANCE, SPACE STATION Cooper and the others haul themselves into the ship. ,7490
To Cooper's surprise, it's quite compact, and divided into two chambers, like nestled spheres. ,22500
COOPER The ship is tiny. ,263000
Doyle, squeezing past him, smiles at Cooper's surprise. ,822000
DOYLE So is the wormhole. ,634000
Doyle pats Cooper on the back. ,592000
Cooper begins hauling gear inside. ,20000
EXT. SPACE, NEAR EARTH ORBIT In complete silence, the Endurance detaches from the space station and rolls gently away. ,70
After a moment, its nuclear engines fire and the Endurance begins to accelerate steadily away from the Earth. ,27200
INT. SPACE STATION The engineer robots who built the Endurance watch as their creation disappears into space. ,16500
Their mission is complete. ,243000
One by one, they shut down. ,966000
INT. CREW QUARTERS, ENDURANCE The crew watch through a translucent section of the ship's hull as the Earth gets steadily smaller. ,7600
Then they settle in for the long journey to the wormhole. 53. ,1130000
INT. CREW QUARTERS, ENDURANCE Tars is hunched over a small communications relay, one hand is holding a paint brush -- he is making delicate strokes, painting the relay a bright blue. ,69
Cooper watches him for a moment. ,1560000
Tars looks up. ,40500000
TARS It's the comms relay. ,12400
It will allow us to talk to earth, even on the far side of the wormhole. ,4400000
COOPER I know. ,14500000
So why are you painting it? ,2730000
Tars looks almost bashful. ,67900
TARS It helps me calibrate my fine motor control. ,283000
COOPER Sure it does. (SMILES) You're pretty good. ,384000
Tars double checks his work. ,5120000
TARS I learned it during the war. ,41600
COOPER What'd you paint? ,7260000
TARS Tombstones. ,2780
Cooper watches him finish in silence. ,3960000
INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM, ENDURANCE Cooper watches a highly-compressed video of his son, Tom, talking about school. ,169000
TOM They said I can start an agriculture class a year early. ,50900000
Cooper shakes his head. ,288000
TOM (CONT'D) I've got to go, Dad. ,73400
Hope you're safe up there. 54. ,6500000
Tom gets up to leave. ,7430000
Donald sits down in his place. ,127000
DONALD I'm sorry, Coop. ,2550000
I asked Murph to record you a message but he's still... well, he's still angry with you. ,468000
I'll try again next week. ,78300000
The video cuts out. ,22800000
Cooper stares at the darkened screen. ,29600
INT. ENGINE ROOM, ENDURANCE Cooper, Brand and Tars are moving the bundles of colonization equipment into bins along the wall of the craft. ,35
Tars pulls a stack of equipment out the stack and stows it against the wall. ,12600
Cooper copies the procedure. ,251000
They labor in silence, working their way along the hull. ,801000
Cooper gets quicker with each bundle, keeping pace with Tars. ,13300
TARS Be careful. ,11200000
It's difficult to gauge mass in zero gravity. ,150000
COOPER How much do these things weigh? ,503000
TARS Four tons. ,3630000
Cooper looks at the incredibly heavy bundle spinning easily in his hands. ,16900
He tries to stop it. ,3910000
Catches his hand. ,2970
COOPER Damn. ,9510
He jerks his hand away, then pushes himself after the spinning bundle, trying to stop it before it can damage the hull. ,21800
Tars helps him catch it inches from the hull wall. ,23800
Brand floats over to Cooper, smiling at him the whole time with an exaggerated grin. ,274000
BRAND Smile. ,263000
Cooper smiles, taken aback by Brand's sudden friendliness. ,12100
COOPER Why? ,27400
BRAND Because it lowers your blood pressure. 55. ,1030000
Cooper looks at his hand. ,3480000
Blood is pouring out of his palm in large glistening bubbles. ,249000
INT. INFIRMARY, ENDURANCE Cooper, slightly embarrassed, is seated while Case is hunched over his hand, sewing the meat of it back together with perfect little stitches. ,1920
CASE How are you feeling? ,76500000
COOPER Fine. ,15700
The anesthetic is working. ,2740000
CASE No -- I mean how is your mood? ,15800000
You seem to be developing good relations with everyone on the mission. ,3090000
Except perhaps Ms. Brand. ,890000
COOPER (EMBARRASSED) You worry about my hand and I'll worry about my mood. ,3600000
CASE Only five percent of my resources are devoted to human anatomy. ,547000
Ten percent is the mission protocol. ,2960000
The rest is human psychology. ,703000
COOPER Why? ,28600
CASE We are floating in a total vacuum in a plastic ship powered by nuclear engines. ,41400
But the most dangerous thing onboard is the three pounds of organic material in your skull. ,16800
COOPER If we're such a liability, why take us along? ,21600000
You and Tars could build the colony without us. ,80000
You wouldn't need to bring food or oxygen. ,1220000
CASE Because humans, despite your obvious physical shortcomings, are better at surviving than we are. ,317000
Your programming is better than ours. 56. ,2030000
COOPER Humans aren't programmed. ,164000
Case stops, looking Cooper in the eye. ,2090000
CASE Would you prefer I was honest? ,3460000
These things can be uncomfortable for humans. ,609000
COOPER Did they program you to be condescending? ,23800000
CASE Yes. ,2090000
Of course. (SMILES) But you're not supposed to notice. ,79400
Case finishes the stitches. ,252000
Ties off the end. ,540000
CASE (CONT'D) Humans are good at surviving because evolution gave you magical thinking -- the idea that your relationships mean something. ,1990
You can't explain the feelings, so you think of them as irrational. ,849000
But they're not. ,3190000
They're programming. ,22700
COOPER (DEFENSIVE) My relationships aren't programming. ,519000
CASE Exactly. ,31800
You believe it so much you won't listen to me. ,880000
COOPER How would that make us better at surviving? ,2670000
CASE When I die, the last thing I will see will be a diagnostic of my own power cycle. ,151000
Would you like to know the last thing you will see? ,101000000
Cooper hesitates. ,1740
Case senses the jump in his heart rate. ,506000
CASE (CONT'D) This conversation is making you uncomfortable. ,89100
We should stop. 57. ,34300000
COOPER No. I want to know. ,58000000
CASE The last thing you will see before you die will be your children. (BEAT) Your mind does this to you to get you to fight a little harder to survive, to try to return to them, even if death is certain. ,22300
Cooper looks away, overcome for a second with emotion. ,1830000
Case watches him, gauging his mood, whether he has said too much. ,1580000
INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM, ENDURANCE Cooper begins recording a message. ,1410000
He looks unsure. ,7050000
COOPER We've almost reached the wormhole. (BEAT) Just in case anything happens, I just wanted to say... (BEAT) I love you boys. ,35400
And I hope whatever your lives become, whatever is coming your way... you make the most of it. ,150000
Cooper stops recording. ,1410000
Looks at the equipment, thinking it over. ,4280000
Erases the message. ,794000
Stands to leave. ,12000000
As he steps to the door he notices Brand watching him through the window. ,498000
She looks away. ,48300
INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE Cooper steps out. ,11900
Brand looks up at him. ,284000
BRAND We'll be able to communicate with Earth even from the far side of the wormhole. ,27200
Cooper smiles, grateful for this small kindness. ,12000
COOPER I know. ,14400000
BRAND I can't imagine how tough it would be to leave your kids behind. 58. ,394000
COOPER You never had any? ,6920000
I thought I was a pariah for only having two. ,78200
BRAND Hard to settle down when you've spent your life waiting to leave the planet. ,212000
Cooper looks at the holographic model of the black hole system. ,214000
The ice planet looks precariously balanced, orbiting the smaller black hole. ,139000
COOPER Strange place to look for a new home. ,23500000
BRAND You wouldn't want to get too close to the surface of the sun, either. ,426000
Black holes are a more stable supply of power than stars in many ways. ,668000
COOPER You really think there's a plan? ,10900000
BRAND I hope so. (looks at him) You don't? ,78400000
COOPER I guess I just think we're on our own. ,51700000
Cooper looks at the impossibly complicated system of black holes orbiting each other. ,11900
EXT. LAGRANGE POINT, SPACE Behind the ship, the sun is a distant light, not much bigger than the other stars. ,9520
CASE (O.S.) We've reached the wormhole. ,18300
The ship slows as it nears a tiny, crystal mouth, just four meters or so in diameter. ,36300
INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE Case looks at the wormhole on the screen. ,15600
It glows with the light of stars billions of light-years away. ,498000
CASE Deploy the comms relay. 59. ,11200
Cooper moves to the communications touchscreen. ,50300
EXT. ENDURANCE The relay is released from the ship, and we finally get a look at Tars' paint job -- the stubby device looks like a 20th century mail box. ,925
The relay drifts in space. ,2860000
A signal light illuminates as it sends a test packet of data to the ship. ,26200
INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE Cooper watches the comms screen. ,5650
After a moment it TONES as it receives a data packet from Earth. ,8210
CASE Everyone take their station for transit. ,52100000
We're heading into the wormhole mouth. ,69400
Cooper and the rest begin folding away equipment in the control room and moving into the outer layer of the ship. ,28900
Case initiates a sequence on the keypad and the nuclear engines disengage themselves from the ship. ,4890
EXT. ENDURANCE, SPACE The nuclear engines drift a safe distance back from the ship and then snap tight on their tether. ,22800
INT. OUTER HULL, ENDURANCE The crew move into the tight, claustrophobic outer layer of the ship. ,32600
They will have very little room as the ship passes through the wormhole. ,125000
Tars detaches his legs in order to take up less space during transit. ,26100
Then he tethers himself to the hull wall. ,735000
Case is the last to join them. ,52300000
He detaches a small control module from the console, then pulls himself into the outer hull and seals the passageway. ,2630
Case presses a button on the control module. ,2530000
With a GROAN, the hull walls of the ship begin to BEND. EXT. ENDURANCE, SPACE The ship's hull begins to CRACK open, revealing the inner chamber. 60. ,7170
INT. OUTER HULL, ENDURANCE The SHUDDERING continues. ,5060
The crew watch nervously as the control chamber below them suddenly opens itself to the cold blackness of space. ,3100
EXT. ENDURANCE, SPACE The ship silently rolls itself into position, pointing the opening in its hull toward the wormhole mouth. ,1020
Slowly, the Endurance pushes itself forward, closer and closer to the crystal-like mouth. ,6960
Finally, it envelops the mouth, bringing it into the open chamber. ,37800
INT. OUTER HULL, ENDURANCE As the crew watch, the wormhole mouth is positioned in the center of the inner compartment. ,13800
Case presses a sequence key on the control panel and the ship's hull closes again, trapping the wormhole inside it. ,8380
With a GRUMBLE, the ship begins contracting, squeezing itself down around the wormhole mouth. ,63800
Cooper takes a deep breath as the center of the ship begins gently lowering itself into the wormhole mouth, feeding itself into the wormhole from the inside out. ,1130
Cooper watches as Doyle is swallowed into the compressing ship with a GRUNT. TARS Would you like me to make a joke? ,6950
COOPER (FIRM) No. Cooper's turn: he is fed into the hole, legs first, then waist, torso, and, finally, his head. ,34800
EXT. SPACE The Endurance shrinks as it sinks from the inside out into the wormhole. ,4830
After a moment, it's gone. ,8020000
The only thing left behind is the comms relay, drifting in space, waiting for a signal. ,70300
INT. OUTER HULL, ENDURANCE The ship continues to slide through the wormhole. ,33100
Through the outer hull they see images of themselves repeating -- a trick of the narrow collar of space they are sinking through. ,34000
Cooper smiles at himself. ,2
The experience is unnerving. 61. ,36900
COOPER Where are we? ,43
ROTH (SMILING) Nowhere. ,11200000
Nowhere at all. ,69000
Nowhere is still pretty damn claustrophobic. ,13900
CASE The hull is intact. ,3580000
Thirty more seconds transit. ,2690000
For a moment, the ship slides gently, silently, through the wormhole. ,15200
The quiet is eery. ,976000
Suddenly, a point of distortion appears in the hull next to Cooper. ,118000
It looks like someone is pushing against the hull of the ship with a giant finger. ,61700
COOPER Something's happening to the hull over here. ,165000
CASE Hull integrity is fine. ,17000000
The distortion moves along the hull, growing in diameter. ,24800
COOPER Well, I don't know what your display is telling you but something is happening over here. ,94200
Suddenly, along the hull, Doyle speaks up, panicked. ,2800
DOYLE I've got a problem over here, too. ,1620000
Doyle is watching a separate distortion move across the inner wall of the ship. ,42500
This one seems to be TWISTING the material of the hull. ,537000
Suddenly, the point in front of Cooper detaches itself from the outer wall and moves through the space in front of him, bending the empty space itself, distorting the ship behind it like a sphere-shaped magnifying glass. ,1370
DOYLE (CONT'D) It's not the hull... it's inside the ship... it's... ,27400
ROTH (SMILES) It's beautiful. 62. ,164000
Roth watches as the distortions move through the ship. ,63400
His curiosity doesn't make anyone else feel any better. ,6800000
DOYLE What the hell are they, Case? ,156000
CASE I don't know. ,58400000
It could be gravitational turbulence. ,1440000
The twisting sphere in front of Doyle begins to grow. ,18
DOYLE It's getting bigger. ,213000
Doyle puts up his hand to defend himself. ,195000
The sphere absorbs it, twisting Doyle's hand. ,58500
Doyle CRIES OUT. His hand is twisted completely around, impossibly mangled. ,65100
But Doyle, hyperventilating, isn't in any pain. ,12300
ROTH It's not bending your hand. ,3370000
It's bending the space around your hand. ,1420000
The sphere begins to pass through Doyle's body. ,64900
Doyle is freaking out. ,6230000
The sphere in front of Cooper makes contact with him, also. ,1100000
He holds his breath as it touches him, squeezing and distorting his body. ,21000
BRAND This isn't turbulence. ,645000
Look at the way they're moving -- it's like something's examining us. ,2000000
Cooper watches the sphere distort his arm, running along the length of it. ,6510
COOPER Can you ask it to stop? ,10100000
Suddenly, as quickly as they appeared, the distortions vanish. ,1070000
For a moment, the crew is silent, still spellbound by the encounter. ,509000
An ALARM sounds. ,11600000
Suddenly, the inner chamber begins to distort from a spherical shape to bispherical: two spheres joined. ,641
The ship GROANS as if it's being pulled apart. ,84800
ROTH The wormhole is splitting into two paths. ,11200
Radiation is pouring from one path to the other. 63. ,2660000
Case stares at the controls. ,109000
Decides. ,14700000
CASE Release the second mouth. ,872000
DOYLE None of our testing involved opening the ship inside the wormhole. ,60300
We have no idea what might happen. ,46600
CASE We're going to find out. ,118000
Doyle reaches over to an auxiliary panel and punches in a sequence. ,20700
After a moment, the hull cracks open, creating a channel through which the radiating mouth can escape. ,546
The opening in the ship allows the pressure to begin to concentrate on one fracture point. ,39300
The ship SHUDDERS as it's squeezed along its axis. ,83300
Case punches in a code and the ship begins to close again, painstakingly slowly. ,6850
Finally, the ship calms as it closes around the original wormhole. ,146000
CASE (CONT'D) We're reaching the far end of the wormhole. ,6740
Suddenly, the wormhole mouth begins to grow inside the inner chamber. ,44
What was a ball of light spreads out into a black canvas studded with points of light -- like looking into the universe through the wrong end of a telescope. ,9720
Cooper presses himself against the wall and holds on as the hull beneath him opens outward. ,1190
EXT. WARPED SIDE OF THE UNIVERSE The Endurance emerges from the opposite end of the wormhole from the inside out. ,3460
It drifts in space. ,1930000
INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE For a moment, the crew are silent, taking it in. ,9860
ROTH Look at that. ,10200000
Roth is looking through the translucent panel on the hull. ,69100
They are on the warped side of the universe. 64. ,118000
EXT. WORMHOLE MOUTH, WARPED SIDE OF THE UNIVERSE The vista is dazzling -- an ocean of massive stars and black holes, some adorned with jets and brilliant gas disks. ,986
At the center, like a king at the center of his court, is Gargantua, plasma jets spewing from its poles. ,528
INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE The crew pull themselves back into the control deck from the outer hull. ,32700
Their incredible surroundings are visible in all directions as Endurance passes the light into the cabin. ,31400
CASE Reconfigure the engines and test the communications array. ,125000

The ship's skin illuminates, overlaying a plotted course on top of the view. 65. ,12000

ANNA Oh, fuck the D.A. ,1
Just at the cloth. ,12700000
Then ABEL makes a small clicking noise. ,3390000
INSTRUCTOR Do you hear that noise... that's the noise. ,2310000
SALES STUDENT ALEX What noise? ,624000
ABEL It means you are close... ,966000
Then after sitting in silence way longer than is comfortable, you turn. ,714000
And say "I'd love to run a few numbers for you. ,268000
Is there somewhere more comfortable we could sit." They will almost always take you to the dining room table and will offer you something. ,514000
ANNA Are they serious? ,1
EXT. WOODS - DAY ABEL exhales then takes three of the boxes and sneaks off into the woods. ,5760

Finally he gets to a small clearing and starts to stack them. ,465000
EXT. FRONT LAWN - DAY ANNA is standing out front trying to hand out goody bags and to maintain pleasantries with the parents as they leave. 69 ANNA Thank you for coming. ,4000
Here you go. ,16100000
Bye, Rebecca. ,1020000
Bye. ,15200000
When the last one goes she looks up at the ASST. DA to give him the all-clear. ,1050000
But as she does she gives him a look that could kill. ,1830000
The police file into the house in front of her. ,125000
EXT. UNDERNEATH THE DECK - DAY ABEL has placed the load of file boxes underneath the deck and is putting the last one in place. ,12600
He sits down on the pile and looks out into the woods in sadness. ,58700
INT. MAIN LIVING/DINING ROOM OF MORALES HOUSE ANNA is looking around the house as the cops search through everything. ,48900
She seems oddly calm. ,665000
She decides that they are being respectful and heads out into the driveway. ,901000
EXT. DRIVEWAY ANNA walks outside and stands, waiting. ,92600
LAWRENCE comes out of the house and stands near her. ,14700000
ANNA This is probably one that you are going to regret. ,51800000
LAWRENCE looks at her trying to figure her out. ,15500000
LAWRENCE Excuse me? ,12400000
ANNA My husband is a very honorable man. ,48200
Coming on a Saturday? ,14000000
It's very aggressive. ,4740000
LAWRENCE This is standard. ,1840000
ANNA Really? ,42800
I know you think you are just doing your job. ,3470000
But we are not what you think we are. ,120000000
And you have embarrassed him in front of his family and friends. ,1220000
She gives him a long, almost scary look. 70 A.D.A. ,119000
LAWRENCE I think I know your father. ,4190000
ANNA Good for you. ,10700000
My husband is not my father. ,1220000
So if I were you I would start treating us with a little more respect or he'll make it our only mission to ruin you. ,202000
This was very disrespectful... and you are not going to find a fucking thing. ,46500000
With that she walks back towards the house as the POLICE start filing out. ,116000
INT. ABEL'S OFFICE - MORNING ABEL is sitting at his desk looking out the window as the trucks come and go. ,115000
As he looks across the lot he sees JULIAN coming walking across towards the locker room. ,1990000
A smile crosses ABEL'S face. ,16100000
INT. STANDARD HEATING OIL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS As ABEL comes out into the hallway SALES STUDENT ALEX is walking by his door. ,5670
ABEL stops to check in. ,117000
ABEL Hey, how are you? ,17400000
SALES STUDENT ALEX Good. ,102000
A bit nervous. ,13800000
I'm heading out on my first calls alone today. ,193000
ABEL You'll do great. ,1180000
Remember... ,21100000
When you get them there. ,12
Hold the eye contact longer than you would like... but you watch what happens. ,1550000
He gives him a big smile and a pat on the back and sends him on his way. ,443000
ABEL (CONT'D) Good luck. ,4830
INT. DRIVER LOCKER ROOM- DAY ABEL comes into the room and JULIAN is getting ready. 71 ABEL It is good to see you back here. ,34800
You look good. ,31300000
JULIAN Thank you. ,24200000
JULIAN is very quiet and timid. ,15200000
He is missing a spark. ,2540000
ABEL Are you ready to get back to work? ,1020000
JULIAN I think so. ,6920000
ABEL You are. ,34100000
JULIAN Thank you. ,26700000
ABEL Where are you heading? ,29500000
JULIAN Bulk delivery to Chase. ,4450000
ABEL Manhattan. ,607
That's a cakewalk. ,33200000
JULIAN does not agree. ,5620000
ABEL can no longer ignore his young protege's concern. ,106000
JULIAN I feel very vulnerable. ,2260000
ABEL jumps on this. ,148000
ABEL Good... ,3110
Because you are. ,7280000
We all are. ,27400000
Someone came to my house a couple nights ago to rob me... ,1580000
A large truck rumbles by and they wait for silence to return. ,157000
ABEL (CONT'D) I tried to chase them away... but really there's nothing I can do. ,34000
I am vulnerable. ,3060000
We all are. ,27900000
They can come back tonight. ,298000
But to succeed and be great you must keep going back. ,46400000
And I know what all these guys want to be doing. ,216000
But it doesn't make you any safer. (MORE) 72 ABEL (CONT'D) And then they will come after me with everything they have... ,26100
So this is what we do. ,16300000
And the times will get better and safer. ,2690000
They will. ,14800000
So go. ,2720000
You are strong just by going. ,5640000
Stronger in fact. ,160000
JULIAN looks down at the ground, shuffles a foot, then climbs into the waiting truck. ,592000
EXT. FRONT PORCH SMALL OF HOUSE IN OZONE PARK - DAY SALES STUDENT ALEX gets out of his car and walks up to the front door. ,29100
He is nervous. ,10600000
He builds the courage and finally rings the doorbell. ,11000
He waits. ,349000
The door opens and a nice lady in her 40's comes to the door. ,2290000
SALES STUDENT ALEX Hi Mrs. ,491000
Rose. ,27500000
I'm Alex with Standard Heating Oil, we had an appointment. ,173000
MRS. ROSE Of course, come in. ,11100000
INT. CAB OF LARGE BULK OIL TRUCK - DAY JULIAN is back behind the wheel and trying to convince himself that all is well. ,3660000
He is making a difficult right turn to get onto the 59th Street Bridge. ,8520000
INT. OZONE PARK HOUSE BASEMENT - DAY SALES STUDENT ALEX is now leaning down on the ground next to the furnace doing the exact same procedure that ABEL did in the training session. ,57
SALES STUDENT ALEX Now as I mentioned on the phone this is a 17 point inspection that will help us to decipher if our maintenance plan will improve your efficiency. ,33700
Just then he brings out the white cloth and wipes the inside of the exhaust. ,55200
And he then does the pause and the look just as he was taught. ,5520000
He holds the look for a very long beat. ,881000
We hear a door opening upstairs and then feet walking across the floor. 73 MRS. ROSE Oh good, it's my husband. ,34700
SALES STUDENT ALEX Great. ,100000
INT. TRUCK CAB, 59TH STREET BRIDGE - DAY JULIAN is up on the bridge moving slowly along with the traffic. ,8650
He is getting paranoid. ,5240000
Looking in his rearview mirror. ,386000
Looking around. ,869000
But there is nothing. ,1080000
No one. ,16500000
INT. OZONE PARK HOUSE BASEMENT - DAY The SALES KID is still on his knees next to the furnace as feet come into frame coming down the basement steps. ,1130
Slowly the HUSBAND comes into frame. ,15900000
MRS. ROSE Here he is. ,117000
The SALES KID stands up to shake his hand. ,28900000
SALES STUDENT ALEX Mr. Rose, I am Alex with Standard Heating Oil. ,171000
HUSBAND Hey. ,8230
SALES STUDENT ALEX I was just showing your wife the results of my inspection. ,1770000
Should we head upstairs to run through some numbers? ,313000
HUSBAND Sure. ,10200
I just had one question about our exhaust chimney. ,2510000
Would you be willing to take a look. ,9590000
SALES STUDENT ALEX Of course. ,168000
HUSBAND It's just outside on the other side of this wall here. ,66900000
MRS. ROSE I'm going to head up. ,1720000
Can I get you something to drink? ,109000000
Coffee... tea? 74 The KID gives himself an ever-so-tiny smile. ,16300
SALES STUDENT ALEX Tea would be great. ,485000
The man walks over to a back basement door and opens it. ,2900000
He ushers the SALES KID through. ,432000
HUSBAND Please. ,103000
DOORWAY OZONE PARK BASEMENT - DAY As the SALES KID goes through the door a massive fist of SOMEONE who has been waiting on the other side of the door comes swinging into frame and pounds the side of our KID'S head. ,482
Knocking him out instantly. ,1900000
INT. TRUCK CAB, 59TH STREET BRIDGE RAMP - DAY JULIAN is close to getting off the bridge and is starting to feel better. ,52500
Just as the traffic in front of him starts to clear up, out of the corner of his eye he sees something. ,520000
In his side-view mirror he sees LOUIS SERVIDIO getting out of a random car behind him. ,11500
His heart starts racing. ,20800000
He looks over in the other mirror and there is THUG #2 walking up. ,9830000
Again. ,27400000
JULIAN thinks for a second then reaches for the CB RADIO. JULIAN Cathy! They are coming again. ,381
Help. ,41600000
Help. ,41600000
On Bridge. ,7200000
He then fumbles the CB and it drops to the floor of the cab. ,42100
He looks up into the mirrors again and sees that they are still coming for him. ,2160000
The camera now comes in tight on his face and he pauses for a long second, and he then makes his decision. ,29300
He reaches under his seat and takes out a handgun. ,2900000
He doesn't really seem to know what he is doing with it. ,3810000
But he opens the door of the truck and gets out. ,649000
He aims the gun at LOUIS SERVIDIO walking towards him. ,34400
LOUIS SERVIDIO sees him and is very surprised and stops. ,235000
LOUIS SERVIDIO Whoa, whoa, whoa! Take it easy there. 75 He glances over at THUG #2. ,5160
JULIAN Get the fuck away from me! LOUIS SERVIDIO Okay, man. ,632000
People in the cars behind the truck are starting to honk. ,241000
Then LOUIS SERVIDIO gives a nod signal to THUG #2 who is on the other side of the truck, and JULIAN'S gun fires by mistake. ,67300
It totally misses THUG #2. ,9350000
He jumps out of the way and is hiding behind the wheel. ,60300
LOUIS SERVIDIO (CONT'D) Watch it now, man. ,15
You're going to hurt someone. ,3350000
JULIAN is now in a total state of panic. ,1310000
He is hiding back in front of the truck. ,1080000
The three men are basically doing a slow- motion, very stressful hide-and-seek around the truck. ,12500
The two THUGS now have their guns out. ,14000000
The honking has now reached a total insane level as traffic is backing up. ,8890
Then THUG #2 makes one last play to take the truck. ,13000000
He tries to climb into the cab and JULIAN goes into a rage. ,293000
He quickly fires three shots, missing THUG #2 with each one, but that forces LOUIS SERVIDIO to shoot two shots of his own at JULIAN to protect THUG #2. ,991
They miss as well, but one hits the main section of the tank and a small but steady stream of heating oil starts pouring out onto the roadway. ,68700
Just then we hear sirens starting to come closer in the background. ,153000
This adds a new element. ,1660000
LOUIS SERVIDIO (CONT'D) Where are you? ,27
THUG #2 Over here. ,13500000
LOUIS SERVIDIO Where is he? ,71
THUG #2 Over here. ,13500000
JULIAN is just trying to decide what to do next. ,48800
The sirens are now getting much closer. 76 LOUIS SERVIDIO Get the car! THUG #2 takes off. ,47000
This now leaves JULIAN and LOUIS SERVIDIO all alone with the police coming. ,88600
As JULIAN is hiding, trying to figure out what to do next, LOUIS SERVIDIO goes running by him. ,7060000
As he does: LOUIS SERVIDIO (CONT'D) Run for it! JULIAN thinks for a second and then runs. ,13300
EXT. 59TH STREET BRIDGE - DAY JULIAN runs all along the bridge and then sees LOUIS SERVIDIO run through a small door into the body of one of the four massive stone anchor structures that hold up the bridge. ,90
INT. THE 59TH STREET BRIDGE, SUPPORT COLUMN - DAY Once he is inside, there's another set of stairs. ,21500
He locks the door behind him and starts racing down the stairs. ,441000
As he heads down he hears someone just in front of him. ,54200
He stops and looks down the center column of the stairs and looking up at him about three flights away is LOUIS SERVIDIO. LOUIS SERVIDIO Oh, there he is. ,54
Had to be the hero eh? ,1780000
JULIAN Fuck you. ,51300000
LOUIS SERVIDIO Couldn't just let us take the truck. ,1200000
JULIAN Fuck you! JULIAN is screaming in a fit of panic at this point. ,36400
LOUIS SERVIDIO Hey man relax... calm down. ,161000
Did they see you come in here? ,101000000
JULIAN can't stop breathing very heavy at this point. ,1110000
JULIAN I don't think so. 77 LOUIS SERVIDIO Did they or not? ,6050000
He thinks. ,3010000
JULIAN No. LOUIS SERVIDIO Alright, there's a door down here about four more flights. ,731000
Don't go out there, that's the street. ,41900000
Go down about two more flights after that and you'll come out below the bridge. ,3040000
They won't be there. ,30100000
JULIAN Fuck you! LOUIS SERVIDIO You're welcome. ,394000
Then LOUIS SERVIDIO's head disappears and we can hear his feet flying down the steps again. ,3130
JULIAN thinks for a beat, then he starts off down the stairs again as well. ,5850000
The camera stays right where it was as JULIAN heads down out of sight. ,306000
We just hear the sounds of his feet getting lower and lower. ,5150000
INT. BRIDGE GROUND FLOOR - DAY JULIAN comes to the first door and looks at it. ,149000
We can hear sirens in the distance on the other side of the door. ,1120000
He keeps going. ,21400000
Down two more flights, just as he said, there is another doorway. ,1480000
JULIAN walks up to that door very carefully. ,144000
He listens on the other side but doesn't hear anything but his own breath. ,1070000
INT. STAIR LANDING LOWEST LEVEL - DAY Then we hear the door back up top fly open. ,51500
JULIAN then quietly opens the door in front of him and right in front of his face is a woman in full jogging clothes running by him. ,30900
He looks around, and after a second to get himself orientated, we see he's on a riverfront esplanade where there are many people jogging and walking, enjoying the evening. 78 JULIAN looks at his hand and realizes he is still holding the gun out in the open. ,360
He puts it away and then looks up at the bridge that is hovering above him. ,7160000
He knows he left his life as he knew it up on that bridge. ,1470000
FADE TO BLACK. Over the black we begin to hear the rumble of a very large truck. ,15100
It gets louder and louder. ,1350000
INT. OF A VERY LARGE EMPTY DUMPSTER - DAY We now see that SALES STUDENT ALEX is inside a massive, empty construction dumpster. ,59600
And as he looks around, we realize it is on the back of a truck that is currently driving pretty fast. ,2530000
With each bump that the truck goes over the noise inside the dumpster is deafening. ,11600
As the KID comes to his senses he tries to stand up. ,4630000
As he does, we see that the sides of the dumpster are at least eight feet tall and the interior is very slick without anything to grab or stand on. ,21100
He is trapped. ,20800000
Just then the truck goes over another huge bump and comes to a stop. ,2020000
It idles for a minute then begins backing up. ,47800
It stops. ,1160000
A warning, beeping alarm is heard, and finally one end of the dumpster begins rising. ,12000
As it gets higher and higher our KID tries to hold himself back, but he begins to slide towards the low end. ,1040
As he does he sees that the end that he is heading towards is on a hinge and it is starting to swing open. ,677000
Finally the thing is at such an angle that he can't hold on any longer and he slides towards the opening. ,513000
As he falls out he/we see that he's being dumped over the edge of a cliff of some sort. ,90100
He falls probably 10-12 feet, into a pile of garbage. ,117000
As he gathers himself and tries to stand, we see he is standing in a massive landfill. ,34800
He looks around as the truck pulls away. ,832000
He's left totally alone. ,4480000
INT. TENNIS COURT OF SUBURBAN MANSION - DAY ABEL is led by a MAID into an indoor tennis court. ,6970
The house is massive and designed like an English Country Estate. ,1970000
As ABEL walks up we see PETER FORENTE on the court playing against an automatic tennis ball machine. ,56500
He is in full tennis whites as he hammers the balls back at the machine. ,194000
ABEL approaches the court and watches for a beat. 79 PETER FORENTE It's a pretty cool machine, isn't it? ,17000
ABEL nods. ,95
PETER FORENTE (CONT'D) I was paying a guy five bucks an hour to do this with me last year. ,83100
ABEL Peter. ,10400
This causes PETER to look up and see the serious look on ABEL's face. ,932000
He hits one last shot and walks a little closer to ABEL. The machine is still hitting balls behind PETER. PETER FORENTE Yes. ,1130
ABEL I need to speak with you. ,1520000
PETER walks over to the machine and unplugs it. ,507000
He points over towards the chairs courtside. ,5840000
He and ABEL sit down. ,3820000
ABEL This has gotten out of control... ,2600000
There was a guy with a gun at my house. ,290000
ABEL lets this sit for a minute, and he is intently reading PETER's face. ,418000
He hopes not, but he is judging to see if PETER had anything to do with all these attacks. ,5320000
PETER just looks back at him with a very strong poker face. ,147000
ABEL (CONT'D) My wife and children were home at the time. ,224000
PETER FORENTE Is everyone okay? ,7140000
I managed to chase him off. ,874000
PETER FORENTE Well, I'm sorry, that must have been scary... what can I do. 80 ABEL I need to know who is doing this. ,342000
PETER FORENTE Abel... ,21500
ABEL It's one thing to come after my trucks and drivers... and to steal from me... but this... it's different. ,42200
ABEL Have you ever dealt with anything like this? ,1540000
PETER FORENTE Have you met my father? ,1440000
They both smile. ,12500000
His father is an old-school gangster. ,1180000
PETER FORENTE (CONT'D) A bunch of thugs invaded our home when I was a baby... ,1430
My mother was there with us... ,16900000
My brother remembers it. ,254000
Nothing happened. ,627000
They were trying to scare my father. ,148000
They ended up just leaving and we never found out who it was. ,360000
But after that we moved to a fortress just like this. ,161000
And those guys who let you in. ,7720000
They are here to shoot anyone who isn't invited. ,14100000
ABEL I refuse to live my life that way. ,59900
I won't do it... ,73200000
I am going to ask for a meeting. ,2430000
They both look out and think it through a bit. ,1520000
PETER FORENTE Who? ,180000
ABEL Anyone with more than 20k of storage. ,138000
Can I count on you being there? ,88200000
PETER looks away for a long beat. 81 PETER FORENTE Yes... ,117000
When are you closing on the terminal? ,68400000
ABEL Monday. ,2720
PETER FORENTE Congratulations. ,2210000
ABEL Hold that... it's not done yet... you may be hearing from me. (Trailed by an awkward laugh.) PETER FORENTE Well, good luck. ,21600
ABEL stands up ready to go. ,1010000
ABEL Thank you for seeing me. ,43000
I want more than this... ,26
PETER FORENTE I know you do. ,138000000
My father is in jail... as you know. ,1050000
And I have always wanted to conduct myself differently than he did. ,1350000
PETER FORENTE Almost exclusively, yes. ,38
But I know why he did what he did. ,45600
Because at the time it's easier. ,45600000
ABEL But it's not. ,3470000
PETER FORENTE Yes it is. ,96
You are a good man. ,102000000
I will see what I can find out. ,660000
This isn't good for any of us. ,518000
ABEL Thank you. 82 EXT. PETER FORENTE'S DRIVEWAY - DAY ABEL is walking across the beautifully-manicured driveway, and as he gets nearer to his car he starts to hear the mayhem that is coming from the CB radio in the front seat. ,13
As he gets closer he gets more and more details. ,2960000
RADIO DISPATCHER V.O. ,843000
Where is the truck now? ,18400000
RESPONDING DRIVER V.O. ,2770000
It's still on the bridge. ,77700000
RADIO DISPATCHER V.O. ,863000
Is it still leaking oil? ,2870000
RESPONDING DRIVER V.O. ,2770000
No. They have stopped the leak. ,5150000
RADIO DISPATCHER V.O. ,843000
Did it reach the river? ,178000
RESPONDING DRIVER V.O. ,2780000
Some did. ,428000
RADIO DISPATCHER V.O. ,843000
How many shots were fired? ,15500000
ABEL now slams open the door and gets into the driver side and picks up the microphone. ,11400
ABEL Joanne it's me. ,5040000
What are you talking about... what shots? ,5340000
The camera now comes around to the outside of the car looking back at ABEL through the windshield. ,33500
The mansion is looming in the background. ,25400
We see ABEL'S face react as he hears the news of the incident on the bridge. ,10300
The camera pulls back as ABEL'S face goes totally cold. ,51900
INT. COURT ROOM - DAY ABEL walks into an almost empty courtroom. ,18300
LAWRENCE is packing up his things at the front of the room. ,174000
They catch each others eye. ,75900000
ABEL makes his way forward as everyone else leaves. ,776000
They look at each other for a beat. ,26200000
LAWRENCE I heard. 83 ABEL I need to make sure you know that we had nothing to do with this. ,519000
It's not the way I do business. ,102000000
In fact I have been warning my men against doing this sort of thing. ,1740000
It is terrible for me. ,1380000
LAWRENCE It's not good... for either of us. ,2710000
LAWRENCE In my job we use whatever leverage we can gain, as I'm sure you do in your business. ,103000
It's an ongoing investigation, and it will be just one piece of many. ,51700000
So while I appreciate you coming here... ,50500000
I have nothing I can tell you. ,93000000
LAWRENCE looks around the room thinking while ABEL says nothing, just waiting. ,98300
LAWRENCE (CONT'D) What a fucking mess this place is... ,34800000
Do you know where he is? ,100000000
ABEL No... but I'll find him. ,273000
LAWRENCE You should. ,32600
And when you do, bring him to us. ,37600000
A situation like this, happening in such a dangerous and public way, within an industry I'm charged with cleaning up. ,31400
It's very bad for me... professionally speaking. ,250000
They look at each other one last time. ,12500000
ABEL gets the message. ,1890000
EXT. SMALL QUIET SIDE STREET, QUEENS - DAY SALES STUDENT ALEX is walking down the street looking terrible. ,40300
His clothes are ruined by garbage, and he is scared. ,3490000
As he approaches his car his face drops. ,1880000
The car has a two-by-four slammed through the shattered windshield. 84 He stops dead in his tracks and then carefully looks around and scans the street looking for anything. ,797
It is eerily empty. ,8420000
EXT. OUTER GATE, STANDARD HEATING OIL YARD - DAY ABEL pulls up in his car and the gate starts to open. ,5380
As it does we see ARTHUR LEWIS standing waiting next to his car. ,286000
ABEL pulls in next to him and gets out. ,25600
There is an overriding, almost unsettling calm to this conversation. ,19800
ARTHUR LEWIS Abel. ,134000
ABEL Arthur. ,4220
ARTHUR LEWIS I wanted to come and talk to you in person... ,76100
We aren't going to be able to show up for you on Monday. ,1270000
We can't do the loan. ,122000000
ABEL I... ,629000
ARTHUR LEWIS I wanted to let you know as soon as possible so that you could try to put something else together. ,34700
ABEL Thank you for coming... ,362000
This is not right. ,14000000
ARTHUR LEWIS I know. ,135000
ABEL What can I do? ,1300000000
ARTHUR LEWIS Nothing... ,134000
The loan review committee met this afternoon and won't meet again for two weeks. ,104000
ABEL And you are aware of the position this is putting me in? ,1310000
ARTHUR LEWIS I am. 85 ABEL I paid off my first loan to you eleven years ago. ,457000
ARTHUR LEWIS I know. ,135000
ABEL Do you remember the term on that loan? ,1070000
ARTHUR LEWIS I don't. ,101000000
ABEL I had seven years to pay you back. ,1150000
They both nod knowing what's coming next. ,5970000
ABEL (CONT'D) Do you know how long it took me to pay you off? ,3970000
ARTHUR LEWIS Seven months? ,134000
ABEL Six and a half. ,2810000
ARTHUR LEWIS I'm sorry. ,77900000
ABEL I put 40 percent down as a deposit on this. ,4150000
It's all we had. ,194000000
ARTHUR LEWIS You now have three separate serious pending legal cases against you. ,29200
One with sixteen counts of misconduct ranging from fraud to tax evasion. ,24400
And then in the middle of our meeting today I get a report saying you had armed your entire fleet of drivers which led to a shoot-out on the 59th Street Bridge. ,24100
ARTHUR LEWIS That may be. 86 ABEL May? ,219000
ARTHUR LEWIS It doesn't matter. ,135000
ABEL It does matter, that you know we didn't do this. ,5780000
ARTHUR LEWIS I do... ,138000
But it doesn't matter, I can't do anything. ,76800000
ABEL's demeanor shifts. ,102000
ABEL I'll find it. ,3800000
ARTHUR LEWIS I know you will. ,75400000
The banker gets into his car and backs out. ,34300
The gate opens and he drives out. ,72200
Just as it is about to close it starts opening again. ,727000
SALES STUDENT ALEX drives in with his car trashed. ,249000
He pulls up and gets out of the car looking at ABEL. He knows what has happened and is crushed. ,24400
Neither of them say a word, finally ABEL gives the kid a cautious but meaningful hug around the shoulder and leads him inside. ,8100
INT. ABEL AND ANNA'S LIVING ROOM - THAT NIGHT ABEL walks into the room and ANNA is sitting at the large dining table smoking a cigarette inside. ,937
She has been crying. ,68500
ANNA It's horrible. ,53600000
ANNA Where is he? ,14100000
ABEL We're looking for him. ,27300
ANNA And they haven't gotten the other guys? 87 ABEL Of course not. ,110000
ANNA Are you okay? ,23000000
I'm not... ,21700000
They're out. ,3080000
This gets her attention. ,4000
ANNA Who? ,181000
ABEL The bank. ,16400000
With that ABEL walks out of the room and heads up the stairs to his bedroom. ,38900
When he's halfway up the stairs she stops him. ,1700000
ANNA So what does that mean? ,72500000
ABEL It means we need to find the money somewhere else. ,42500000
ANNA We have two days! ABEL I'll figure it out. ,957000
INT. ANNA'S CAR, WESTCHESTER SCENIC HIGHWAY - DAY ABEL is driving ANNA'S car towards the city. ,8190
ANNA is in the passenger seat and the three DAUGHTERS are in the back. ,158000
ANNA and ABEL do not look any better. ,769000
In fact there is now a tinge of anger mixed into the sadness. ,151000
The DAUGHTERS are arguing about who's taking up too much room in the back seat. ,2230000
DAUGHTERS Move. ,146000
ANNA Quiet. ,2380
DAUGHTERS You move. 88 ANNA turns and snaps at them a bit. ,1170000
ANNA Stop. ,14100
I've told you guys not to push it this morning, this is not the morning to be doing this... but since the second you all woke up. ,2630000
It's this, it's that. ,29
Just stop. ,1280000
The world does not revolve around you! This shuts them up for a beat. ,20000000
ABEL is seething. ,17300
But then ELIZABETH (middle) nudges ANNIE (oldest) so she gives CATHERINE (youngest) a good hit. ,48700
ANNA sees it and freaks. ,1460000
ANNA (CONT'D) That's it Annie we've told you... ,130000
Before ANNA can get the full sentence out ABEL suddenly pulls the car off the side of the highway into the grass. ,52500
Everyone in the car is taken aback. ,226000
The road is a smaller scenic highway not some eight lane affair but this whole sequence still plays out with the menacing roar of the cars going by right next to them. ,96
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY ABEL gets out of the car and slams the door. ,59700
He walks around the back of the car as the cars fly by them on the highway. ,3130000
He goes around to his oldest daughter's door and pulls ANNIE from the car. ,825000
They stand behind the car and go at it with the traffic flying by. ,3050000
ABEL is louder than he has been in the entire film. ,62200
He is losing it from all the pressure but his daughter bears the brunt. ,7960000
ABEL You are thirteen years old. ,30700000
Your mother asks you an hour ago to help her get out of the house smoothly and you are acting like an... ,33900
ANNIE Oh fuck you! ABEL What? ,442000
ABEL is looking around for someone to help him and witness this. ,406000
He then switches, he has had enough and gets right up in her face. 89 ABEL (CONT'D) I'm not sure who the hell you think you are, but you don't talk to me that way... ,32500
You are in serious danger of becoming a rich little spoiled brat and I can tell you from experience there is nothing worse in the world than a rich little girl who thinks the whole world revolves around her. ,5060
ANNIE is yelling back over the traffic. ,1160000
ANNIE The world revolves around me? ,36300
Me! What about her? ,34400000
And what about you? ,5100000
You're both so totally obsessed with your stupid business. ,1310000
You walk around like you are saving the world but what are you doing... nothing! This stings. ,19200000
He now changes his tone to a quiet low roar. ,25200
But he can't keep quiet and by the end of the line he is yelling again. ,2690000
ABEL First off I don't walk around like I am saving anything. ,6780000
I chose this business because I looked at the world and said `What's the last bill people stop paying every month when they are low on cash?' `Cause that's a business I want to be in. `Cause failure wasn't much of an option for me. ,275000
I lived in reality... not whatever this world is you are living in. ,5570000
And we help people stay warm... which isn't all that bad. (now he is yelling again) Maybe you've got grander ambitions but for now this is how you eat, sleep, and get all dressed up... ,1370
So you better shape the fuck up and NEVER speak to me like this again! ANNA Stop!! They both look over and ANNA is standing there. ,51200
A calmness suddenly falls down on all of them. 90 INT. ANNA'S CAR ON HIGHWAY - DAY All five of them are sitting in the car, sadness prevails. ,7220
INT. ANNA MORALES' LIBRARY - NIGHT The camera moves slowly across a dark hallway. ,71200
We hear the sounds of a manual adding machine grinding away. ,109000
As we come through the doorway we see ANNA MORALES sitting at her desk in a pool of light from the desk lamp. ,55800
She is deep in it crunching numbers. ,159000
Finally ABEL walks into the doorway, he looks exhausted. ,24900
ABEL Hey. ,2380
She looks up with a small but sweet smile. ,21500000
ANNA Hi. ABEL How's it coming? ,176000
ANNA I've made it to 1975. ,315000
ABEL That was a good year. ,66800
ANNA gives a slight look that the numbers may not totally support that claim. ,213000
ABEL (CONT'D) Well it was for me...how is it? ,42000
ANNA I'm not sure yet... but it's not as bad as they are saying it is... ,320000
Turns out I kinda knew what I was doing. ,334000
They give each other a slight smile. ,8040000
ANNA (CONT'D) How'd you do? ,647000
ABEL I got us a three more days... and one piece... from Saul. ,5420000
But we're still about a million short. ,72300000
They look at each other with concern. 91 ANNA You're going to see your little brother? ,5560000
ABEL First thing. ,12
ANNA And Peter? ,14500000
ABEL Probably. ,1560
As they look at each other ABEL ANNA This is all worth it. ,38800000
He pauses just long enough to think. ,32500000
ABEL Of course. ,2780
A sense of caring and resolve comes over them. ,37600
At least now they know what needs to be done. ,13300000
ABEL (CONT'D) You should get to bed. ,109000
ANNA I'll be up. ,40600000
ABEL I love you. ,26300000
ANNA I love you too. ,1050000
ABEL turns to go upstairs as ANNA starts in again with the machine. ,2650
INT. HALLWAY, OUTSIDE OF JULIAN'S APARTMENT - DAY ANDREW stands in the hallway about to knock, but he waits for a beat. ,1600
He knocks. ,244000
The door opens to a young woman, presumably JULIAN'S wife, LUISA. ANDREW WALSH Is Julian here? 92 LUISA No. ANDREW WALSH Abel would like to speak with him. ,916
To help him. ,3810000
LUISA I will tell him. ,177000
JULIAN steps into the frame from behind her. ,62300
EXT./INT. LARGE LATE-MODEL AMERICAN CAR, PARKED - DAY A DRIVER is sitting in the driver's seat. ,21500
ANDREW walks up and gets in the front seat. ,215000
JULIAN gets into the back and looks over at ABEL who is sitting next to him. ,128000
They drive off and nobody says a word for a very, very long time. ,4230000
EXT. EMPTY PARKING LOT - DAY The car finally pulls into a large empty parking lot. ,255000
For a couple beats JULIAN has a look on his face that he may be getting rubbed out. ,1630000
Then off in the distance we see two cop cars. ,41300
The car pulls up to them and stops. ,7610000
ABEL and the DRIVER get out of the car without a word, but ANDREW stays and turns around and now gives him a total debrief. ,40400
JULIAN He's turning me in? ,17700000
ANDREW looks at him without much remorse. ,2130000
ANDREW WALSH Of course we are turning you in. ,74700000
You have put everything that man has worked for for the last 20 years at risk. ,27100000
If it was up to me we would be dealing with this in a very different way. ,107000000
JULIAN But I know things... ,5290000
This causes ANDREW to turn quickly back to him with as sharp a look as he has. ,557000
ANDREW WALSH Really? 93 JULIAN Yes. ,114000
ANDREW WALSH And what things do you know? ,368000
JULIAN looks back at him. ,1150000
ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D) I strongly suggest you think that through before you answer it. ,106000
Because even if you did, what does it do for you? ,3230000
There is nothing there for you to gain. ,22600000
JULIAN I'm sorry. ,2700000
ANDREW WALSH I am too. ,81200000
ANDREW now changes his tone. ,319000
ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D) They say they have you firing four shots, is that right? ,1120
JULIAN I don't know. ,9240000
ANDREW WALSH Where's the gun? ,83200000
JULIAN stutters for a moment, then. ,12000
JULIAN I threw it in the river. ,1740000
ANDREW WALSH Good. ,71300
Your background check with us says you have never been arrested, is that true? ,186000
JULIAN Why is this putting everything at risk? ,86000
ANDREW WALSH Have you ever been arrested? ,52000
JULIAN No. 94 ANDREW WALSH Because no bank will touch us right now. ,54000
So we can't close on the new property. ,36500000
And he's going to lose everything on his deposit. ,3160000
This sits heavily on JULIAN. ANDREW hands him a card. ,82700
ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D) This is a lawyer who will meet you when they bring you to the station. ,80700
You no longer work for us. ,4010000
You've been fired. ,194000
But Abel wants to pay for the lawyer. ,41700
So... this guy should be able to help you. ,13900000
Good luck. ,8170000
With that JULIAN gets out of the car. ,830000
ABEL is standing there. ,4
They meet. ,3950000
JULIAN I'm sorry. ,2700000
JULIAN I was scared. ,11800000
ABEL Sometimes. ,1300
JULIAN What do you do? ,717000000
ABEL thinks this through long and hard. ,101000
ABEL I have always been much more scared of failure than anything else. ,1040000
ABEL It wasn't always like this. 95 JULIAN Are you ruined? ,781000
ABEL Not today... but by the end of the week... maybe. ,308000
JULIAN I'm sorry. ,2700000
ABEL Good... ,3110
JULIAN No... ,32200
I am not strong. ,40000000
ABEL That does not have to be true. ,3830000
JULIAN Trust me... ,28000000
I am not... ,8900000
With that JULIAN walks across the parking lot towards the POLICE to turn himself in. ,10100
ANDREW walks up behind ABEL and stands there looking. ,273000
ANDREW WALSH I'm late. ,166000
I will meet you at four. ,63600000
ABEL I'm gonna try to get us a little more time. ,37900000
The three COPS are standing waiting as JULIAN walks towards them. ,41100
ABEL turns around, facing the camera, and closes his eyes in sadness. ,626000
With ABEL in the foreground we see JULIAN make it halfway to the COPS, then he stops. ,22900
COP 1 Hey. ,12600000
ABEL'S face tells us he knows what is coming. ,755000
JULIAN sets off running. ,1460000
Before the COPS can get close to him he is off. ,2130000
ABEL turns and sees what is happening. ,3990000
He does not follow chase. ,625000
His head just drops. 96 EXT. VARIOUS 1980'S URBAN DECAY LANDSCAPES We are now with JULIAN again, running. ,16800
But as this chase continues we see his face turn from fear, to desperation, to a creeping sense of evil. ,5260
He does not know how it has come to this, but as he jumps down from fences and runs across deserted lots we see that his weakness is turning. ,26300
As he runs through some of the most bombed-out, destroyed sections of Queens, he just never stops. ,1740000
With each step his fear turns to... anger. ,71800
EXT. BLOWN-OUT BUILDING He stops, collapses, and hides behind a blown-out building wall just as a COP CAR drives by. ,11200
He starts to almost cry, but then it again becomes something else. ,5040000
His survival instinct is taking over and we are not sure what will become of it. ,3370000
Anger. ,14600000
INT. OLDEST HASIDIC BUSINESSMAN'S LIVING ROOM - DAY ABEL sits across from the oldest Hasidic member of the family, JOSEPH, from the first scene. ,6150
ABEL Thank you for seeing me. ,43000
JOSEPH Of course. ,13200000
ABEL I need more time. ,100000000
JOSEPH Of course you do. ,865000
ABEL I know our agreement doesn't allow for that. ,158000
I need more time. ,3550000
JOSEPH Why? ,25200
This takes ABEL back a bit. ,650000
ABEL Thank you for asking. ,1120000
Many, many reasons. 97 JOSEPH It's a difficult time to do business. ,182000
ABEL Yes... it is. ,38
JOSEPH I'll give you three more days. ,384000
Then it's over. ,78900000
INT. ASSISTANT DA'S OFFICE - DAY ANDREW sits across from LAWRENCE and DEPUTY LANGE. They wait while LAWRENCE writes something down on a pad in front of him. ,693
He finishes. ,350000
LAWRENCE So. I should start by thanking you for your assistance in... in attempting to bring in your driver? ,1260000
ANDREW WALSH We didn't think he'd react that way. ,126000
LAWRENCE Yes... ,49800
Well, the officers there didn't set it up very well on their end either. ,3150000
ANDREW WALSH I'm sorry. ,77900000
LAWRENCE We are looking for him. ,235000
ANDREW WALSH So are we... it's very sad. ,266000
LAWRENCE I understand. ,507
Ms. Lange. ,35400
DEPUTY LANGE It has been brought to our attention that it might be beneficial on your end to resolve this issue in a time sensitive way. 98 ANDREW WALSH Possibly. ,35500
DEPUTY LANGE So we have prepared an offer for you to review. ,270000
They slide the offer across the table. ,908000
ANDREW opens it and gives it a once over. ,22800000
ANDREW WALSH I'll show this to them. ,78500000
He'll never go for it, but it's a start. ,67300000
LAWRENCE This could get a lot worse for you all. ,286000
ANDREW WALSH I know... ,68200
I will present it to him. ,5210000
ANDREW gets up and prepares to leave. ,329000
LAWRENCE stands with him and walks him out into the hallway. ,168000
ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D) Thank you. ,322000
LAWRENCE And Andrew, one other thing. ,148000
They are now alone in the hallway. ,405000
INT. IMPOSSIBLY LONG HALLWAY - DAY A.D.A. ,1730000
ANDREW WALSH You need what to stop? ,404000
LAWRENCE This fucking bullshit with the open warfare. ,30800
I won't put up with it. ,18800000
It's starting to be a real problem. ,76100000
ANDREW WALSH Starting to be? ,71300
No shit. ,455000
LAWRENCE Not for you... but for me. ,1250000
This lingers for a beat as the meaning sinks in. 99 A.D.A. ,12300
LAWRENCE (CONT'D) I need the driver. ,103000
The kid went out and got his own gun. ,44800000
This was not us. ,113000
No matter what you think of him, Abel doesn't work this way. ,10700000
LAWRENCE I really could give a fuck, but you need to get your man to talk to these people, give in, stop doing whatever you are doing to bring this shit on you. ,311000
It needs to stop. ,1280000
ANDREW WALSH He wants to talk to them. ,9700000
We've been trying to set up a meeting. ,2030000
O'Leary hasn't been able to get it done. ,350000
LAWRENCE I'll talk to him. ,170000
ANDREW gives him a look. ,182000
LAWRENCE (CONT'D) He's an old friend... and get that kid back in here. ,346000
I'm up in it a little bit here and I need something. ,6190000
LAWRENCE turns and walks back into his office. ,217000
ANDREW walks down the hallway all alone then stops. ,35600
He reaches into his briefcase and takes out the offer. ,1300000
He looks it over again. ,74300000
Then he looks towards the ground and almost looks like he might cry. ,7930000
There is a distinct sense of responsibility for the situation that ABEL finds himself in that is starting to bring ANDREW to the edge. ,15000
EXT. CEMETERY - DAY ABEL is waiting standing next to his car. ,439000
ANDREW comes driving into the lot next to him and gets out. ,2520000
ABEL I talked to the Hasid, I got us three days. ,465000
ANDREW nods. 100 ANDREW WALSH Is that enough? ,311000
ANDREW WALSH Well here it is. ,265000
It's just a first pass. ,1500000
He hands him the plea deal from the DA. ABEL looks it over but shows almost no emotion. ,44900
Then. ,20500000
ABEL Felons can't vote. ,182000
This takes ANDREW back. ,331000
ANDREW WALSH I'm sorry? ,77900000
ABEL This plea has me... ,2370000
ANDREW WALSH I know. ,71200
It's just a first offer. ,952000
ABEL I would never take this. ,32500000
ANDREW WALSH I know. ,71200
ABEL looks off and resets. ,608000
ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D) He's going to get us the meeting. ,265000
ANDREW WALSH Lawrence, he's tight with O'Leary. ,281000
ABEL Of course he is. ,1050000
ANDREW WALSH Does Julian have anything? ,305000
ABEL gives him a look? ,415000
ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D) Anything on us? 101 ABEL All the drivers could have us on scales. ,37
ANDREW WALSH If we are cutting deals, we can't have anything new come up at the last minute. ,88500000
ABEL He would never do that. ,899000
ANDREW WALSH We need to find him... ,75600
Lawrence needs him. ,10300000
INT. JULIAN'S APARTMENT - DAY ABEL stands outside the door for a very long beat then finally knocks. ,6850
JULIAN'S wife, LUISA, opens the door. ,113000
She gestures him in. ,10600000
He enters the apartment and looks around. ,2820000
She gestures for him to sit. ,1530000
He chooses a seat right across from her. ,83100
He stares at her for a beat. ,16600000
Then for the first time we hear him speak Spanish. (This whole conversation is in Spanish) ABEL Thank you for letting me in. ,55100
LUISA Of course. ,10700000
ABEL moves his chair closer. ,364000
It's meant to be, and is a bit threatening. ,50100
ABEL Have you seen Julian? ,4060000
LUISA No. ABEL questions her with a look. ,840000
ABEL We need to find him. ,5590000
LUISA I know. ,14600000
ABEL I am worried about him. 102 LUISA So am I. ,141000
ABEL You know we were going to support him. ,50200000
I do not know why he ran. ,274000
LUISA He was scared. ,1240000
ABEL shakes his head. ,158000
LUISA He has always wanted to make you proud. ,2050000
You know that right? ,147000000
Well this time that hasn't worked out. ,3580000
LUISA No... ,26100
How did you do it? ,247000000
ABEL Do what? ,32900000
LUISA This. ,18700
She motions towards his suit. ,171000
LUISA (CONT'D) Success... that's all he wanted. ,228000
It makes me very sad, because he is a very talented young man. ,2440000
But there are some decisions that you cannot come back from. ,11800000
I need to know where he is. ,2960000
And I need him to turn himself in. ,4360000
His actions are hurting me and my business. ,5520000
And I refuse to let other people's weaknesses hurt me. ,1280000
I don't know how it has come to this, but it has. ,93400000
If he does the right thing I will help to take care of his responsibilities. ,8030000
You and your family. ,25000000
When you see him. ,1930000
Tell him this. ,221000
Please. 103 LUISA I will. ,15500
ABEL gets up and starts looking around the apartment a bit. ,324000
He walks over to a small cabinet. ,515000
ABEL Does he have any money? ,117000000
LUISA I'm sorry? ,2700000
ABEL Money? ,9010
Has he taken money out of your bank account? ,5690000
LUISA I don't know? ,9230000
ABEL You need to start looking into these things. ,50000000
It is very important that we find him safely. ,1570000
And with that JULIAN comes smashing out of the tiny cabinet where he was hiding and knocks over ABEL. JULIAN runs to the front door with ABEL chasing him. ,30300
He starts flying down the stairs at top panic speed. ,11300000
ABEL follows him down half the flight and realizes it is useless. ,15200
ABEL (CONT'D) (IN ENGLISH) Stop! Stop running away! Andrew! He's coming your way! This is screamed at the top of his lungs but JULIAN never stops. ,3000
We just hear his footsteps going down. ,1220000
INT. BOTTOM/TOP OF JULIAN'S STAIRWELL - DAY ANDREW comes up the first few steps and we see him waiting for JULIAN. ABEL then looks back up the half flight of stairs and sees LUISA standing there in the hall. ,599
He walks back up to her in an aggressive way. ,7460000
We fear for her. ,515000
He gets right up in her face but does not touch her. ,30600000
ABEL (in Spanish again) I understand why you lied, but it is not smart. (MORE) 104 ABEL (CONT'D) There are other people looking for him. ,1630
I am as good an option as he has. ,369000
Know this. ,9410000
And with that he heads down the stairs. ,1040000
EXT. BACK OF JULIAN'S APARTMENT/PARK STAIRS - DAY JULIAN is running out the back of the building and down a huge exterior staircase that is in a small park. ,1260
He is about half way down when ANDREW gets to the top. ,554000
ANDREW screams. ,872
ANDREW WALSH Fuck You! You better run! INT. A SLIGHTLY RUNDOWN CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY ABEL sits across a table from an OLD MAN in his late-70's who seems to have early-onset dementia and a WOMAN in her early- 20's, LORRAINE LEFKOWITZ who's overweight, but confident. ,5
The old man, SAUL LEFKOWITZ, just sits there through the scene. ,190000
ABEL Thank you both for agreeing to meet with me. ,566000
LORRAINE LEFKOWITZ Of course. ,16700
ABEL I think we have met before but I didn't realize you were Saul's Granddaughter. ,18700
LORRAINE LEFKOWITZ I am. ,156000
ABEL I'm sorry to ask but how old are you? ,13900000
LORRAINE LEFKOWITZ I'm 23. ,18100
ABEL Oh. LORRAINE LEFKOWITZ My Grandfather didn't trust any of his children to run the business. 105 ABEL Yes. ,11700
LORRAINE LEFKOWITZ I know that you tried to buy the company from my Grandfather several times. ,260000
LORRAINE LEFKOWITZ His goal was to stay healthy long enough to be able to give the company to me. ,342000
Which he thankfully did. ,2070000
They both give a slight smile. ,36500
LORRAINE LEFKOWITZ (CONT'D) So, while I appreciate your visit we are still not for sale. ,6370
And I hope that your Grandfather was able to communicate to you how much I have always respected him. ,2120000
And it was only out of respect for the business he had built, and because I knew of his reservations and feelings about your uncles and your father that I made those offers. ,7530
LORAINE LEFKOWITZ I understand. ,4860000
ABEL But, I am not here to offer to buy your company. ,50100000
LORAINE LEFKOWITZ Oh. ABEL As I'm sure you will soon learn some years are good... others not so. ,21200
I am in contract with a significant hard deposit at risk to purchase the old Bayfront terminal. ,60800
LORAINE LEFKOWITZ I see. 106 ABEL And due to circumstances beyond my control my bank has left me at the altar. ,2840
LORAINE LEFKOWITZ I'm sorry. ,27700
ABEL So, I am here, hat in hand, looking for a loan. ,583000
I certainly expect the terms to be in your favor as I could not be at a weaker place. ,160000
But, if your Grandfather trusted you with his company, I would be willing to trust you as my lien holder. ,1710000
They all stare at each other. ,4130000
Then the old man shifts in his chair. ,8470000
SAUL LEFKOWITZ How much? ,26000
ABEL I need $500,000. ,3330000
SAUL and his GRANDDAUGHTER look at each other. ,1710000
They say nothing but clearly know each other well. ,26300000
LORAINE LEFKOWITZ Would you give us a minute. ,2300000
ABEL Of course. ,2810
INT. WAITING AREA, OUTSIDE THE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY ABEL sits in a simple chair outside the conference room looking around at an office that is similar to his. ,1950
A phone on the receptionist's desk rings. ,1280000
She picks it up. ,79700000
LEFKOWITZ RECEPTIONIST You can go back in. ,2900
INT. SLIGHTLY RUNDOWN CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY ABEL sits down. ,344000
LORAINE LEFKOWITZ We can offer you the 500k at 20 percent for a year. (MORE) 107 LORAINE LEFKOWITZ (CONT'D) And we would need a five-year straight wholesale holding agreement for 250,000 gallons a year at your new facility. ,6
This hits ABEL hard. ,628000
They shake hands and then he hugs the old man good bye. ,277000
LORAINE LEFKOWITZ So, I guess we will see you tonight? ,2920000
ABEL Tonight? ,1020
Oh yes, of course. ,21500000
INT. LONG ISLAND ITALIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT A HOSTESS leads ABEL and ANDREW through the whole main dining room and through a side kitchen. ,57600
INT. ITALIAN RESTAURANT - PRIVATE DINING ROOM - NIGHT Finally they come through a door and into a small back private dining room where fifteen of their COMPETITORS, a couple of whom we have already met (Including LORRAINE and SAUL LEFKOWITZ, and ARNOLD KLINE), are sitting around the table meeting and waiting for them to arrive. ,25100
The whole room looks up at them. ,12500000
O'LEARY is at the head of the table at the far end of the room. ,134000
He stands up to greet them and then so does the rest of the room. ,199000
Finally everyone settles and the room falls quiet. ,1290000
BILL O'LEARY (CONT'D) Abel. ,167000
Now the room is silent as it waits and waits for him to speak. ,376000
ABEL Stop... 108 ABEL is deadly serious. ,89600
He just lets this sit and looks around the room at each person. ,339000
They all seem to be waiting for him to continue. ,4670000
But he doesn't. ,13600000
He just lets this sit. ,1100000
Finally PETER FORENTE, who is across from ABEL, shifts in his seat and leans forward. ,13900
PETER FORENTE Um... ,26000
Abel... we had a chance to meet for a little bit before you got here and... of course everyone in this room is fully capable of lying to their own mothers on their deathbeds, but... the conclusion we have come to... ,2700
I should say we are fairly convinced after a very frank conversation... that these guys who are doing this... that they don't actually work for anyone in this room. ,1610000
As you know there are many other smaller providers in the area that might be responsible who are not here tonight. ,1960000
Everyone then shifts back their attention to ABEL waiting for his response. ,1290000
ABEL Peter... thank you... ,85700
He stops and thinks about how to continue. ,7090000
ABEL (CONT'D) But over the last six months 110,000 gallons of fuel has been stolen from my family and I. ,5070
Now the reason we asked Bill to get you all here is because the people in this room are the only people within two hundred miles of here who have the ability to purchase and store that kind of quantity. ,22700
So... no matter what bullshit you have been telling each other one of you... or two... or three... has been allowing this to happen by buying this from these cowards or worse yet hiring these guys just to do it. ,31000
And profiting from it. ,18500
So what I am saying is... ,1490000
Stop! Now. ,783000
Have some pride in what you do and stop. 109 INT. ANNA MORALES' LIBRARY - NIGHT The camera moves slowly across a dark hallway. ,23300
We hear the sounds of a manual adding machine grinding away. ,102000
As we come through the doorway we see ANNA MORALES sitting at her desk in a pool of light from the desk lamp. ,55800
She is deep in it crunching numbers. ,159000
Finally ABEL walks into the doorway, he looks exhausted. ,24900
ABEL Hey. ,2380
She looks up with a small but sweet smile. ,21500000
ANNA Hi. ABEL How's it coming? ,176000
ANNA I've made it to 1975. ,315000
ABEL That was a good year. ,67300
ANNA gives a slight look that the numbers may not totally support that claim. ,213000
ABEL (CONT'D) Well it was for me...how is it? ,42200
ANNA I'm not sure yet... but it's not as bad as they are saying it is... ,113000
I guess I knew what I was doing. ,64600
They give each other a slight smile. ,16100000
ANNA (CONT'D) How'd you do? ,1060000
ABEL I got us a three more days... and one piece... from Saul. ,5480000
But we're still about a million short. ,73600000
Concern and exhaustion creep onto Abel's face. ,13100
ANNA You're going to see your little brother? 110 ABEL First thing. ,124000
ANNA And Peter? ,14500000
ABEL Probably. ,1560
Abel is now sitting down on the chair. ,308000
ABEL (CONT'D) How are the girls? ,28000
I feel like I haven't seen them in days. ,23500000
ANNA They're fine. ,10
ANNA (CONT'D) This is all worth it. ,84600000
He pauses just long enough to think. ,32200000
ABEL Of course. ,2810
ANNA Look at us...it is. ,63200000
A sense of caring and resolve comes over them. ,37600
At least now they know what needs to be done. ,13300000
ABEL (CONT'D) We should get to bed. ,131000
ANNA I'll be up. ,40600000
ABEL I love you. ,26300000
ANNA I love you too. ,1210000
ABEL turns to go upstairs as ANNA starts in again with the machine. 111 INT. ABEL'S CAR - DRIVING - DAY ABEL is driving towards the office and is listening to the idle chatter on the radio between the dispatcher and the drivers who are out. ,21
They are underneath the Brooklyn Queens Expressway in stop and go traffic. ,209000
Suddenly a panic stricken VOICE blasts through on the radio. ,61100
SENIOR DRIVER EDDY V.O. ,419000
Motherfuckers! RADIO DISPATCHER V.O. ,5330
SENIOR DRIVER EDDY V.O. ,419000
It's 17. ,817000
RADIO DISPATCHER V.O. ,843000
We now hear the driver yell at the TWO GUYS coming at him. ,151000
SENIOR DRIVER EDDY V.O. ,419000
Fuck you! RADIO DISPATCHER V.O. ,89600
Where are you! SENIOR DRIVER EDDY V.O. ,245000
Hall Street and Flushing Ave. ,92300
I'm out of... ,34800000
RADIO DISPATCHER V.O. ,843000
Eddy? ,14400000
Eddy? ,14400000
ABEL looks up at the street where they are and realizes this is going down right down the street from them. ,328000
He's had enough. ,860000
He pulls across the intersection and heads down a street. ,70000
He comes to the next intersection and right in front of him the truck comes flying by. ,115000
He looks to his right and sees EDDY standing at the side of the road. ,1150000
But he wants to end this. ,443000
So he pulls out and starts following the truck leaving EDDY behind. ,1240000
ABEL follows the truck for several blocks through the industrial neighborhood. ,42500
He is tempted to pull up alongside of it to see who is driving but doesn't. ,1430000
He continues to follow him. 112 They get to a light and the truck makes a right hand turn and, as they are turning, LOUIS SERVIDIO who is sitting in the passenger seat looks behind him and sees that ABEL is following him. ,657
It now turns into a high speed chase as the driver steps on it. ,166000
ABEL chases the truck as it crosses the tracks and heads towards an abandoned tunnel. ,34400
The truck races into the tunnel and ABEL follows. ,249000
The truck is throwing up a dust storm and ABEL has a difficult time seeing where he is going but he keeps up. ,2050
The roadway is very bumpy and both the truck and ABEL'S car are thrown around and the truck almost hits the sides of the tunnel. ,9900
The light at the end of the tunnel starts to appear through the dust but we can't see the truck. ,189000
As ABEL comes into the light he has to SLAM on his brakes because the TRUCK has flipped over in front of him. ,1350
As he gets out of his car he sees LOUIS SERVIDIO jumping down from the overturned cab and run off into the train yard. ,968
ABEL looks at the crushed cab of the truck and sees the DRIVER has been killed. ,21400
There is a gun sitting on the dash of the truck and ABEL looks and thinks. ,93800
EXT. SUBWAY STATION - DAY ABEL runs up the stairs of the station and hops onto a leaving train just as the doors shut. ,15400
ABEL looks around. ,11400000
There are three people in his car. ,55400000
It is covered in graffiti. ,949000
He starts making his way down to the end of the train where the guy is. ,1060000
He looks into the last car and sees LOUIS SERVIDIO and just bull rushes him to the ground. ,11700000
He starts beating on him very, very badly with the pistol. ,54300
All the rage comes out of him. ,348000
He then aims the gun at LOUIS SERVIDIO. LOUIS SERVIDIO Please. ,8190
ABEL Your friend is dead... who do you work for. 113 LOUIS SERVIDIO You know I could never tell you that. ,43500
ABEL Stop... just stop. ,113000
LOUIS SERVIDIO This was it anyway. ,7720000
ABEL looks right through him and then finally lowers the gun and releases his hands from around his jacket and he gets up and looks back at ABEL. LOUIS SERVIDIO (CONT'D) Thank you. ,66
LOUIS SERVIDIO then runs out of the car as the door opens. ,3940000
ABEL sits up and slows his breathing down. ,198000
Finally he looks around the trashed car and sees that a woman has been in the car with them the whole time and she is just staring at him. ,310000
INT. BROOKLYN BARBERSHOP - DAY ABEL walks into the shop and is a little put back together but is worse for the wear. ,50600
ARNOLD KLINE is sitting in one of the chairs waiting. ,242000
He turns to ABEL. ARNOLD KLINE Hey. ,290000
ABEL Jimmy, can you give me a minute? ,53600000
Jimmy looks around then walks into the back. ,3120000
ARNOLD KLINE Abel, that was well said. ,52300
ARNOLD KLINE What can I do for you? ,1290000000
ABEL I've just come to collect that check you owe me. ,3130000
This takes him back a step. ,589000
ARNOLD KLINE What check is that? 114 ABEL The one for $213,000. ,78400
ARNOLD KLINE I'm sorry? ,2160000
ABEL That's how much has been taken from me over the last six months. ,4410000
ARNOLD KLINE I had nothing to do with that. ,79000
ABEL Your Far Rockaway facility bought a load of fuel last week off one of my stolen trucks. ,7460
ARNOLD KLINE That's not possible. ,162000
ABEL I was standing on top of one of my hi-jacked trucks a couple weeks ago thinking about the cowards who did this when I remembered I had bought the load of fuel off a friend's tanker straight from Texas. ,2190
As I'm sure you know Texas #4 is marked. ,51800000
But that was just one load, so every truck that has left my lot for the last two weeks has been marked with dye that I've put in... ,82600
And luckily four more of my trucks got jacked since.... ,63400
My guess is there are at least 4600 gallons of marked fuel in your small tank right now. ,9570
ARNOLD KLINE How much? ,200000
ABEL I said...213,000. ,7140000
ARNOLD KLINE I'll need a day. ,626000
ABEL gets ready to leave. 115 ARNOLD KLINE I've just been buying this stuff off these guys, it was only a couple loads, I don't know who they are. ,93
I would never do that. ,55000000
ABEL My goal was to have you out of business by the end of next year. ,896000
And if you're this fucking desperate it doesn't seem like it will even take that long. ,1160000
He walks away. ,242000
ARNOLD KLINE Abel, I wasn't the only person buying this shit. ,58000
ABEL I don't care. ,1020000
ARNOLD KLINE It may ruin me. ,12700
ABEL When you find out who else it was you can get them to pay you back the difference. ,1790000
Kinda makes you miss having your father around? ,553000
But I need the whole lot tomorrow or the feds will be at your doorstep by noon. ,2580000
He leaves. ,2400000
EXT. UNIVERSITY ATHLETIC FIELD - DAY ABEL is sitting on a bleacher totally alone watching a prep school football practice. ,30800
We stay with him as he sits quietly just watching. ,4490000
Eventually his 21-YEAR-OLD YOUNGER BROTHER, ELIAS, comes walking off the field over to him. ,36600
PLAYERS start leaving the field. ,435000
ABEL You look good out there. ,405000
ELIAS I didn't know you were coming. 116 ABEL I didn't either... ,14200000
I didn't mean to take you away. ,48800000
ELIAS We're done. ,21300000
He sits down next to him. ,3500000
They both look out for a long, long beat. ,32700000
ELIAS (CONT'D) Thanks for coming. ,139000
ABEL Of course. ,2810
You've grown. ,71600000
ELIAS You saw me a month ago. ,51200000
ABEL I know... but you have. ,2230000
ELIAS Yes. ,5650
ELIAS I don't. ,50
ABEL I'm in a bit of a rough patch. ,628000
ELIAS Yes... ,5650
Then thinks about sitting down again. ,1
ELIAS What will? ,33
Then he sits. ,146000
ELIAS looks over. ,26
ELIAS What is it? ,47
ABEL 210. ,1120
ELIAS Since when do you need to be taking out sucker mortgages for 200 grand? ,45500
It will be fine. ,978000
They look at each other for a long beat. ,13
And then he signs it. ,401000
ABEL (CONT'D) Thank you... ,3
ABEL I love you too. ,14
They hug and then ELIAS walks off. ,958000
PETER comes into the light. ,1
PETER FORENTE Well here he is. ,4570
The caped crusader. ,231000
ABEL I am. ,49800
And thanks for seeing me. ,26300
So what is it? ,6020000
Then comes back. ,300000
ABEL Six hundred thousand. ,2
Abel, that's a problem. ,1
ABEL The terminal. ,3
You're good at what you do, probably better than us, and I accept that. ,1
But this would be different. ,4
We are not nice people to borrow three quarters of million dollars from. ,1
ABEL I know that. ,13
Both of us. 120 INT. ABEL AND ANNA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT ABEL comes in as ANNA is sitting at the table smoking. ,768
ANNA What a day. ,12
ABEL Yeah. ,1570
ANNA Car chases? ,66500000
ABEL Yeah. ,1580
ANNA Who knew? ,4430
She gives him a loving look. ,12
ABEL He seemed good... ,4870000
ANNA Enough. ,4360
ABEL Yeah. ,1560
ANNA How did it go? ,18300000
ANNA I'm sorry. ,32200
ANNA I know. ,184000
He looks up at her. ,170000
ABEL Whose? ,3450
ANNA Ours. ,5440
ANNA It will help. ,7
ABEL Where did it come from? ,3
ABEL Where did it come from? ,3
Some years a little... others a lot. ,48900000
I didn't know what else to do... ,510000
This knocks him back. ,946
ANNA (CONT'D) I'm sorry. ,33400
ABEL What do you expect me to do with this? ,301000000
ANNA Use it.... ,1430
ANNA What does that mean? ,28
ANNA It's as clean as every other dollar we've ever made. ,1
ABEL That's a fucking bullshit answer. ,1
And you can use that when they drag me off to jail! With that he tries to get passed her and head upstairs. ,42800
ABEL I'll get it done. ,285000
ANNA (Yelling, but controlled enough to not wake the kids.) Oh you are too much. ,1
You've been walking around your whole life like this all happened because of your hard work, good luck, and charm. ,3
Mr. Fucking American Dream. ,33
Well this is America... but it's not a dream, and that wasn't good luck helping you out all those years... ,3
ANNA Oh... ,76500
He looks exhausted. ,6680
ANNA comes into the room. ,19
She stands at the entryway just looking at him for a very long beat. ,27000
It's the smart play. ,72200
ABEL I know... ,12500
INT. THE TEMPORARY OFFICE TRAILER - DAY ABEL and ANDREW are sitting around the folding table opposite the HASIDS. ABEL signs the document and then picks it up and heads outside. ,3700
ANNA gets up from her desk and comes over to him. ,238000
ABEL looks across as a small group of GIRLS FIELD HOCKEY PLAYERS walk across the field in front of them. ,44900
They watch them pass and walk away. ,19700000
ABEL (CONT'D) The girls at this place... they are so beautiful? ,209000
He looks over with a wry smile. ,37700
ABEL I don't know how you get anything done around here. ,4460000
Slight smile at each other. ,257000
ABEL It happens. 117 ELIAS I know. ,364000
ABEL stands and looks around for a good bit. ,1700000
ABEL (CONT'D) That will be your burden... ,166000
ABEL Not having had one. ,72600000
ABEL (CONT'D) I need your signature on this. ,319000
ABEL I need to take out a short term mortgage on our apartment building. ,1680000
ELIAS That thing isn't worth more than 150 grand though? ,1350000
ABEL I'm up against it a bit. ,816000
It's good to see your face. 118 ELIAS I love you. ,356000
ABEL sits back down and just watches him walk away. ,72300
INT. FORENTE TENNIS COURT - NIGHT ABEL walks into the darkened tennis court and looks around. ,1950
We aren't sure what he is there for. ,50200000
On the other side of the court a light is on in a attached lounge. ,24300000
PETER FORENTE Come over. ,47
INT. TENNIS COURT LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS ABEL The one guy didn't make it out of the crash, and the other guy disappeared. ,5940
PETER FORENTE That was very well said last night. ,16000000
PETER FORENTE Of course. ,21500
ABEL I need a loan. 119 PETER'S face scrunches up like he tasted a lemon and he turns away for a beat. ,3340
PETER FORENTE You don't want to do that. ,155000000
ABEL No shit... but I'm here. ,233000
PETER FORENTE What are we talking about here. ,975000
PETER FORENTE Jesus. ,21500
ABEL Yes... but if I don't get it... ,79300000
PETER FORENTE What's my collateral? ,3030000
PETER FORENTE Yeah me and how many other people will be coming after it. ,1050000
ABEL You'll get your money. ,52500000
PETER FORENTE Abel, you know I respect everything you've done. ,65900000
Because of it we haven't come down on you the way I should have for coming into my service area and poaching my customers. ,620000
I don't want you to be in this position. ,107000000
PETER FORENTE Let's sleep on this. ,67000
He walks over and sits down at the table with her. ,2730000
She gives him a great sly smile. ,694000
ANNA (CONT'D) How was your brother? ,80600000
But the girls up at that place are... ,30600000
ABEL I can tell you the girls didn't look like that where I went to school... ,4640000
After a brief light moment the cloud comes back over him. ,8840000
ABEL How are we here? 121 ANNA It was a lot of things all at once. ,2110000
Three different parties... it'll be a mess... and the terms... ,149000
Peter suddenly showed me his true colors. ,1720000
He lets out a brutal sigh. ,52600
ABEL I spent my whole life trying not to become a gangster... ,699000
ABEL ...And now... on the biggest deal in my career they will all control me. ,1480000
He sits there for a long beat and then she comes and hands him a piece of paper with a series of numbers on it. ,333000
ABEL (CONT'D) What is this? ,109000
ANNA It's a bank account. ,457000
ABEL just waits for more but gets nothing. ,31600
ABEL How much is in it? 122 ANNA A lot. ,3790000
You could replace Peter's money and get him out of the deal. ,4940000
She stops and thinks, then: ANNA Since 1971 I have been skimming money out of the company. ,45600
In the beginning it was just in case times got tough but then it was because you were taking all these chances... ,585000
I couldn't risk having us be left with nothing. ,3530000
ABEL Is it clean? ,6480000
He thinks that through. 123 ABEL It means if you walked into the office of the people who have been trying to put us in jail right now and slapped a check from that account down on their desk would it push me further into hell or help to get me out? ,49200
ANNA I can clear it on the books. ,95000
ABEL Well it sounds like you should take this money and keep it right where it is... because I'm going to pretend that we never had this conversation. ,415000
She follows and is standing looking up at him. ,12900000
ANNA So what's your plan here? ,91100000
He turns to her and squares off. ,367000
And it won't be as a cheat. ,59100000
IT WAS ME! Doing the things you didn't want to know about... 124 ABEL You stole from me! This stops her in her tracks. ,41500
And eventually a little smile comes across her face. ,5060000
She comes way down and almost delivers this line in a whisper. ,246000
You have always been very good about not letting your ego get in the way of business. ,1560000
Don't start now just because it's me. ,78400000
With that ABEL turns up the stairs and heads to bed. ,164000
INT. MASTER BATHROOM - MORNING ABEL is getting ready for the day shaving. ,21900000
ABEL We'll use the money... your money. ,11400000
ANNA It's our money. ,52000000
FADE TO BLACK. Before we see anything, we hear the sound of a pen writing on paper. ,63000
EXT. TEMPORARY TRAILER - DAY ABEL comes out and we see ANNA standing outside the trailer in the cold because these guys don't do business with women. ,65900
He hands her the document. ,639000
Under her breath: ANNA These fucking guys...what's this additional $11,000? 125 ABEL I guess there is still some fuel in two of the tanks... they gave us a fair price on it. ,61900
With that they both smile, she signs it and then gives him a kiss. ,2440000
INT. TEMPORARY TRAILER - DAY ABEL comes back in and hands the docs to JOSEPH, the oldest Hasid, who signs them. ,13900
JOSEPH Mazel Tov. ,414000
EXT. TRAILER/TANK FARM - DAY ABEL walks across the lot with joy although it seems masked by a sadness. ,31400
He looks around as ANDREW and ANNA come up next to him. ,18200000
ABEL To you too. ,4320000
Did you know...about the money? ,3010000
ANDREW looks him right in the eye. ,6620000
ABEL You should have told me. ,71900000
ANNA Abel...congratulations. ,770000
Now cheer up. ,1740000
And can someone give me a tour of this place we just paid two million bucks for? ,811000
ABEL, ANDREW, and ANNA walk towards the tanks looking around. ,26000
They come around the corner to THE VIEW. 126 EXT. BEHIND THE TANKS, WITH A VIEW OF THE CITY - DAY They all look out. ,8160
ANNA What a hell-hole this city is. ,28600
ABEL No. ANDREW WALSH I don't know why but I guess I never realized we even had this view from back here. ,469000
That line sits for a long beat. ,5550000
ABEL I did. ,24500000
Then they hear someone behind them. ,242000
They turn. ,5620000
It's JULIAN. He is standing holding a gun. ,3840000
They stare for a long beat. ,800000
ABEL (CONT'D) I thought you said you threw that into the river? ,16900
JULIAN I didn't. ,6910000
ABEL I see that. ,10
JULIAN I have nowhere to go. ,197000
ABEL Nowhere easy. ,12100000
I have nothing. ,21500000
And somehow you've ended up with everything you wanted. ,4600000
ABEL looks at the gun in his hand. ,117000
ABEL It wasn't meant to be. ,29400
JULIAN What is that supposed to mean? 127 ABEL I know what you wanted. ,236000
But you need to forget that. ,832000
You are looking backward. ,24600000
Only look forward, that is what you can control. ,67100000
You gave me a very good chance. ,19800000
JULIAN Probably a better chance than I deserved. ,72700
ABEL No. JULIAN Please take care of my family. ,1640000
ABEL Julian. ,8180
JULIAN Please... ,8560
ABEL looks at him trying to read where this poor kid is at. ,127000
ABEL I will. ,10500000
With that JULIAN takes the gun and puts it in his mouth and pulls the trigger. ,21200
The gun goes off and the red blood sprays on the white side of the fuel tank that is behind him. ,55
ABEL and the rest are left totally in shock. ,575000
They are beside themselves. ,38200
But out of the corner of his eye ABEL notices that the bullet has also pierced through the tank and amid the red spray a flow of black heating oil is pouring out through the bullet hole onto the ground. ,96
ABEL steps around JULIAN'S body and goes over to the hole. ,58700
He picks up an old rag from the ground and stuffs it into the hole plugging the flow of oil. ,3950
ANDREW WALSH What... what should we do? 128 ABEL turns and looks back at him. ,11300
ABEL We call the police. ,553000
ANDREW WALSH Really? ,71200
ABEL Yes! With that he walks off behind the tanks. ,29600
EXT. PARKING LOT, NEXT TO THE TANK FARM SITE - DAY There are now POLICE VEHICLES everywhere. ,88200
ABEL is standing off alone. ,6480000
The DA gets out of a car all alone and walks over to ABEL. A.D.A. ,66200
LAWRENCE I'm very sorry. ,265000
Did you know him well? ,92700
ABEL I did. ,24300000
LAWRENCE He must have been under a hell of a lot of pressure. ,949000
For a while I thought he was... it's just... ,133000
LAWRENCE I'm sorry. ,2380000
They look out across the city. ,73300000
ABEL You really do have to be lucky. ,1450000
LAWRENCE Yes... so you are chasing down hijackers now? ,611000
ABEL I was right there... ,56400
I couldn't help myself. ,3940000
LAWRENCE nods approval. 129 ABEL (CONT'D) Have you found the driver? ,1820
LAWRENCE No. ABEL You'll find him. ,11600000
LAWRENCE Probably not. ,12500000
ABEL Well, thank you for coming. ,414000
I wanted to make sure this was handled correctly. ,1610000
ABEL I'm not sure how I got here. ,50200000
LAWRENCE Yeah. ,8420
ABEL So... ,8880
I should tell you that I won't be able to take that deal you offered. ,927000
There is no way I would ever accept a felony charge for anything we've done. ,1030000
LAWRENCE I know. ,14300000
ABEL I am not a felon. ,1020000
LAWRENCE That's probably true. ,104000
ABEL But I also can't have you digging around my life and keeping this hanging around my neck for the next ten years. ,2570000
I love fighting a good battle but this... it's very bad for my business. ,7980000
This gets Lawrence's attention. 130 ABEL (CONT'D) So, we need to come to some sort of conclusion. ,9760
They both look out for a beat. ,5180000
LAWRENCE I hear you closed on this terminal today? ,12200000
ABEL It looks that way. ,3820000
LAWRENCE I didn't realize that you had that in the works. ,2430000
ABEL For a very long time. ,64400
LAWRENCE That will put you in quite a powerful position. ,204000
ABEL Within my business it has that potential. ,48700000
LAWRENCE shifts his tone ever so slightly. ,162000
LAWRENCE If you get this place up and running again it will have significant influence... politically speaking. ,533000
ABEL picks up on the word POLITICALLY and stares down LAWRENCE. A.D.A. ,12900
LAWRENCE (CONT'D) We all have our ambitions. ,503000
LAWRENCE gives a slight smile and then pauses. 131 A.D.A. ,20700
LAWRENCE And sometimes we need help to get there... ,2250000
You've come a very long way. ,39800000
ABEL Yes, I have. ,18000000
LAWRENCE In a very short time. ,4070000
ABEL It doesn't feel that way... ,815000
But please know that I have always chosen the path that was the most right. ,9350000
LAWRENCE The most right? ,72500000
LAWRENCE That one makes my head hurt a little. ,1500000
ABEL The result is never in question for me. ,277000
Just what path do I take to get there. ,130000000
And I have never questioned my path. ,301000
There is always one that is most right. ,3670000
And that is what this is. ,8
LAWRENCE I hope so. ,91000
They look at each other and then out over the city. ,23600000
BIG EYES Written by Scott Alexander & Larry Karaszewski FADE IN: TITLE SEQUENCE: TIGHT on TWO PAINTED EYES. The pupils are impossibly wide. ,27
Imploring. ,392000
The watery rims spill a single tear. ,21500
We PULL OUT... revealing the eyes belong to a child. ,44900
A young girl, fingers clasped pitifully. ,80500
She's forlorn, alone in a dirty gray alley. ,171000
We feel shame. ,10200000
Compassion. ,13500000
Sorrow... ,12800000
Then -- an IDENTICAL girl SLAPS in front of the first one. ,48200000
Then another! It's a PRINTING PRESS, the creation of a BLUR of sad children. ,324000
A KINETIC montage! HORDES of gazing WAIFS get lithographed, bundled: Huddling in worry. ,4300
Floating in space. ,11400000
POSTERS. POSTCARDS. BOOKS. We ZOOM into a MAGAZINE AD: A 1960's era come-on -- "IT'S KEANE! MUSEUM-QUALITY ART, MAILED DIRECTLY TO YOUR HOME!" A blizzard of NEWSPAPER ARTICLES: "Meet America's Million- Dollar Painter!" "Keane Masterpiece at World's Fair" Painted EYES float by. ,85

It has to be good. ,9340000
If it were bad, so many people wouldn't like it." -- ANDY WARHOL CUT TO: EXT. SUBURBIA - 1958 A nice, orderly tract of post-World War II housing. ,2
Identical rows of little yards. ,4350000
Young MOMS. Scampering KIDS. Then, a SUBTITLE: "TEN YEARS EARLIER" 2. ,101000000
INT. HOUSE - DAY CU on two concerned eyes. ,1510000
The same eyes as the paintings. ,1440000
We REVEAL they belong to a real girl: JANE, 8. ,1100000
She sits in her small house -- a typical young family's, spare and underfurnished. ,332000
Suddenly -- Jane's mother MARGARET ULBRICH, 28, rushes through frame. ,3450
Margaret is blonde, yearning, fragile. ,12500
Terribly upset, she is hurriedly packing. ,3680000
Margaret throws her clothes in a suitcase. ,66800
She shoves Jane's clothes and toys into another. ,145000
Margaret barrels through the breakfast nook, which is a mini art studio -- easel, canvases, paints. ,8470
She scoops up her supplies. ,339000
Margaret runs to the door -- then turns. ,481000
The hallway is lined with her PAINTINGS. Oils and inks of wide-eyed Jane, who grows from baby to toddler to child. ,19600
Hastily, Margaret takes them down, each frame leaving an empty mark on the flowered wallpaper. ,6250
Finally she reaches the last spot -- a WEDDING PHOTO: Margaret and her HUSBAND, smiling, happy. ,138000
Margaret peers -- then leaves it hanging. ,23300
The door SLAMS. CUT TO: EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY Cars roar down an interstate. ,31700
INT. PACKARD - DRIVING - DAY Margaret grips the wheel, uncertain. ,60700
Jane stares. ,20600
The car is all loaded up. ,93700000
REFLECTIONS of passing BILLBOARDS drift across the windshield. ,14800
Images of perky, happy-fake Americans. ,276000
Has she made the right decision...? ,1960000
CUT TO: EST. SAN FRANCISCO - DAY San Francisco, 1958! A mix of SKYLINES and STOCK FOOTAGE. EXT. FURNITURE FACTORY - DAY A weathered building: "G & B FURNITURE SUPPLY." Margaret sits in the Packard, fixing her lipstick. ,43600
Jane holds the "WANT ADS," a few circled. ,13600000
Margaret gets out and straightens her skirt. ,198000
Jane smiles. ,4320
JANE Good luck. 3. ,448000
INT. FURNITURE FACTORY - DAY A beaten industrial office. ,2650000
Margaret sits anxiously, watching the BOSS, a tired guy in a cheap suit. ,29300
He glowers unsurely at her JOB APPLICATION. Scratching his face. ,30300
Hmmmm... ,1590000
BOSS We don't get many ladies in here. ,38800000
So your husband approves of you working? ,45400000
MARGARET (quiet; a soft Southern lilt) My husband and I are separated. ,1310000
BOSS (SHOCKED) "Separated"? ,1190000
A deadly silence. ,10400000
He squirms uncomfortably. ,1680
She presses on. ,1270000
MARGARET Sir, I realize I have no employment experience... but I sure need this job. ,2600000
I have a daughter to support. (PAUSE) I'm not very good at tooting my own horn... but I love to paint, and if I could just show you my portfolio... ,20500
He is baffled. ,21300000
Margaret pulls out a large ARTIST'S PORTFOLIO. She opens it, riffling through the pictures... ,27900
MARGARET I studied at the Watkins Art Institute in Nashville, then took Illustration classes in New York. ,52000
Here's a pastel I did... here's some fashion design... a portrait in charcoal... though I enjoy mixing mediums, preferably oil and ink... ,2160
She's alive, enthused. ,37400000
The guy shakes his head. ,1440000
BOSS You do understand this is a furniture company? ,11200000
CLOSEUP - MARGARET A strained smile. 4. ,1120000
INT. FACTORY FLOOR - LATER Margaret works on an enamel baby crib. ,58200
Under stenciled "Humpty Dumpty," she quickly paints on a cartoonish egg man. ,2640
We WIDEN, revealing ten identical, completed cribs behind her. ,948
We WIDEN again -- revealing a DOZEN PAINTERS. All surrounded by identical cribs. ,580
All painting identical Humpty Dumpty's. ,253000
CUT TO: EXT. SAN FRANCISCO NORTH BEACH - 1958 - DAY NORTH BEACH! An exotica of Beatniks, palm readers, interracial couples and coffeehouses. ,18
Ground zero for the Avant Garde. ,366000
Margaret waits on a busy corner, a bit dazed, peering at the parade of fun-loving Hipsters. ,335
Primly, she fixes herself. ,219000
Margaret turns -- and suddenly grins. ,167000
Running up is DEE-ANN, 30, a Beat girl in a black leotard and sandals. ,20900
Dee-Ann excitedly grabs her, and they laugh and hug girlishly. ,19
DEE-ANN Sugar, you made it! You're in North Beach! MARGARET Deirdre, look at you! DEE-ANN (CORRECTING) "Dee-Ann." MARGARET "Dee-Ann"?! DEE-ANN Yeah, I know. ,445
But I hit this scene... and "Deirdre" just sounded like something my mother would call me. ,143000
Margaret giggles. ,548
DEE-ANN So are you flipping for all this?! Are you settled? ,152000
How's Jane? ,12400000
MARGARET Jane -- is swell. ,38900
She's started in a sweet little school. (PAUSE) Though... it's hard without her father. ,719000
I'm not sure we can do this... ,111000000
The thought hangs, and Margaret gets emotional. ,29700
Teary-eyed. 5. ,34300000
DEE-ANN Oh stop that. ,360000
You're better off. ,2300000
Between us, I never liked Frank. ,64700000
MARGARET (SHOCKED) You were a bridesmaid! DEE-ANN Exactly. ,47400
That's why I couldn't speak up. ,134000
But if I ever see you wrong off again, I will tell you. (LONG BEAT) Now come on. ,701000
Let's have some fun. ,1850000
WIDE - They start WALKING. Dee-Ann gestures. ,94600
DEE-ANN Toss off your middle-class preconceptions! This is Pompeii! We're livin' in the volcano!! For jazz, check up the hungry i. ,2
For Italian, Vanessi's. ,29700
For salvation, try the Buddhist temple. ,80600
For art, the Six Gallery -- They pass a GALLERY. The displays are stark, Calder-like MOBILES and found-object SCULPTURES. Margaret stares, unsure. ,6690
MARGARET Do they only show Modern? ,85800000
DEE-ANN Everyone only shows Modern! (SHE POINTS) In the basement, they've got espresso. ,969
MARGARET What's espresso? (WORRIED) Is that like reefer? ,195000
Dee-Ann LAUGHS, astounded. ,42700
DEE-ANN You've got a lot to learn! EXT. ART SHOW - DAY A Sunday ART SHOW. It's picturesque, amateur ARTISTS displaying their paintings, jewelry, sculpture... ,29
The modern stalls are crowded with trendy BOHEMIANS. Abstract lines, speckles of color. ,13400
We drift away... and find Margaret, alone in her stall with Jane. ,35800
Margaret sits patiently, surrounded by Big Eye paintings and charcoal portraits. ,9650
In contrast with the neighbors, her work seems... quaint. 6. ,855000
A pink, chubby TOURIST FAMILY ambles over. ,85400
Margaret brightens hopefully. ,36600
TOURIST GUY Your stuff is cute. ,68600000
MARGARET Today's a special: Two dollars. ,102000
TOURIST GUY I'll give you one. ,1670000
Beat -- then she nods, agreeing. ,121000
She gestures. ,17700
The little BOY sits. ,2120000
Margaret clips a fresh sheet of paper, sharpens her charcoal... and... goes motionless. ,400000
Studying the boy's face. ,20000000
He gazes back. ,5410
Then -- inspired, she begins sketching his EYES. Large and exaggerated. ,17100
Then she fills in the shape of his head. ,4190000
His ears. ,695000
His jaw. ,323000
In a rush, his likeness appears. ,1090000
The parents come over to peek -- then gasp. ,31600
Margaret is good. ,21400000
She sketches faster. ,2180000
Focused. ,15200000
Until a LOUD, PLUMMY VOICE drifts in... ,1770
MAN'S VOICE Monet? "Monet"?! Whew -- that's a hell of a compliment. ,262000
Though, if I may respectfully disagree, I'm more in the tradition of Pissarro. ,230000
Margaret looks up, distracted. ,166000
She resumes her work. ,1850000
MAN'S VOICE C'mon, get closer. ,379000
Closer! Look at that sunlight coming through the mottled leaves. ,122000
That's a bold yellow! Curious, Margaret casually peers over... ,27100
HER POV Holding court in another booth is WALTER KEANE, 40. ,816
Walter is astonishing: Hugely confident. ,13500
Charming. ,13800000
Waggishly handsome. ,3
And dressed like an "Artist" -- striped turtleneck, with hands full of brushes. ,101000
Walter's stall is filled with oils of Paris street scenes. ,16400
He casually flirts with TWO YOUNG COEDS. They admire a painting. ,12300
WALTER You wanna touch it? ,32500000
Do it! I lay it on thick -- you're not gonna break it! (UNWAVERING) I poured myself into that painting. ,8350
Walter glances over -- and notices Margaret watching him. ,1010000
Shy, she quickly turns away, back to her portrait. ,2090000
Walter smiles rakishly. ,453000
He's found a new interest. ,23500
WALTER Excuse me, Ladies. ,4610000
WIDE Walter strides up to Margaret. ,19400
She peers nervously... trying to ignore him. ,17000
She sketches faster. ,2160000
Shading... ,7590000
Walter watches. ,1890
Admiring... and discreetly smelling her hair. ,2000000
Margaret pays no attention. ,962000
Done, she blows into a can of Fix- It. Poosh! A fine mist sprays, setting the portrait. ,4670
Without fanfare, she humbly turns the picture. ,5670000
MARGARET All finished. ,94200
Her customers gape, impressed. ,12200
The guy counts out four quarters, then happily leaves. ,106000
MARGARET AND WALTER are left together. ,796000
An unspoken frisson, until -- WALTER You're better than spare change. ,6940
You shouldn't sell yourself so cheap. ,679000
MARGARET I'm just glad they liked it. ,112000
WALTER Ahhh! You're past that point! Your heart is in your work... ,3160000
He leans in, too close. ,2630000
Margaret shivers. ,1650
Breathing faster. ,182000
WALTER What's your name? ,193000000
MARGARET M-Margaret... ,5210000
Mmm. ,14100000
He grins, checking her out... her loose sexy blouse and tight black capris. ,29
She flushes. ,6850
MARGARET Wouldn't you rather flirt with those dolls over there? 8. ,379000
WALTER Mm, no. (BEAT) I like you, Margaret... ,248000
He zeroes in on the artworks' signature: "M. ,11300
Ulbrich" WALTER "...Ulbrich." (IMPASSIONED) You know, Margaret Ulbrich, you're undervaluing yourself. ,93
Lemme show you how it's done. ,308000
Walter spins to Jane. ,246000
He SHOUTS out, like a carnival barker. ,192000
WALTER Little Girl! How would you like your portrait sketched by the World- Renowned Margaret Ulbrich?! Queen of the Bay! In mere minutes, she will capture your soul! Hm. Jane shrugs, unimpressed. ,218
JANE Nah. ,2920
WALTER "Nah"?! (he grabs a PAINTING) Don't you wish this were you in this beautiful painting?? ,450000
JANE But that IS me! And that's me... (she POINTS all over) And that one started as me, but then Mother turned it into a Chinese boy. ,2330000
Walter peers at Jane... then at Margaret. ,583000
And then -- it hits him. ,14500000
He grimaces, embarrassed. ,6870000
WALTER Oh, you're Mommy! My apologies, Honey. ,936000
I misconstrued the situation. (SHEEPISH) Well I'll just mosey along, before Mr. Ulbrich comes back and socks me in the eye. ,1120
ON MARGARET A gut decision. ,147000
She stares at Walter, then smiles slyly. ,95900
MARGARET Mr. Ulbrich is out of the picture...! 9. ,105000
ON WALTER His face slowly lights up. ,837000
Ah! Sun breaking through clouds. ,4350000
CUT TO: EST. FRENCH BISTRO - NIGHT INT. BISTRO - NIGHT An enchanting bistro. ,117000
Wine barrels, laughing, twinkly tivoli lights. ,18700
Perfection. ,13900000
Walter flamboyantly enters, escorting Margaret. ,5690
Instantly, the STAFF ERUPTS in excitement: "Monsieur Keane! Ah, Monsieur Keane is here! Bonsoir!" WALTER Bonsoir, gang! Henri! Sorry I didn't call first. ,5900
Est-ce que tout va bien? ,217000
MAITRE'D Je vais bien, merci! Comment allez- vous? ,476000
WALTER Je vais bien! I'm with a beautiful woman! Could life be any grander?? ,137000
They get led in. ,9330000
Margaret is dazzled. ,29300
Walter whispers. ,1450
WALTER And I don't even have to pay! I'm set because I gave the chef a painting. ,335000
You know what he said? "Nobody paints Montmartre like Walter Keane!" LATER Margaret and Walter enjoy an intimate dinner. ,8050
The wine flows. ,1080000
MARGARET I can't believe you lived in Paris. ,3880000
WALTER Best time of my life... ,294000
MARGARET I've never even been on an airplane. ,723000
WALTER Well you have to experience these things! Grab 'em!! (JOCUND) I wanted to be an artist, so I just went! Studied painting at the Beaux- Arts. ,70
Lived in a Left Bank studio. ,217000
I survived on bread and wine... 10. ,721000
MARGARET You're a romantic. ,2840000
WALTER Damn right! A wistful shrug. ,40900
He chugs his glass. ,10400000
WALTER Of course, walkin' away from the bourgeois scene wasn't a snap. ,1310
I had to quit my job. ,5160000
Leave my wife. ,14100000
These choices aren't easy... ,2910000
She stares at her wine. ,190000
MARGARET I've never acted freely. ,97900
I was the daughter. ,12100000
The wife. ,11700000
The mother... (SHE SIGHS) All my paintings are of Jane, because she's all I know. ,350000
WALTER You shouldn't knock your work. ,14900000
I'd give an eyetooth to have your talent. ,160000
Margaret is taken aback. ,13300000
He's absolutely sincere. ,39
WALTER You can look into someone and capture them on canvas! You paint people! (he gestures sadly) I can only paint -- things. ,8780
My street scenes are charming... but at the end of the day, it's just a collection of sidewalks and buildings. ,11200
Walter goes silent. ,1480000
He has revealed his fears. ,126000
ANGLE - MARGARET She doesn't know what to say. ,5930000
Gently, she takes his hand. ,163000
MARGARET Walter, I'd bet you could paint anything. ,215000
WALTER (INTENSE) Whew... ,73500
Baby, when you look at me like that, I could fall hard. ,10400000
Margaret gulps. ,17
Afraid to talk. 11. ,1120000
MARGARET This is moving fast. ,967000
You're my first date in a long time... ,56200000
Neither of them speaks. ,2570
The tension builds -- There is a spark between them... ,941000
CUT TO: EXT. PALACE OF FINE ARTS - DAY A lush green knoll, overlooking the park. ,128000
Margaret and Walter have set-up TWO EASELS. They both smoke cigarettes. ,124000
Margaret is spattered with paint, stirring colors. ,12500
Walter paces about, framing the scene with his fingers. ,121000
Jane sits in front of them, playing paddleball. ,335000
Bonk! Bonk! MARGARET Sweetie, could you stop fidgeting? ,3730
JANE Mother, after all this time, you MUST know what my face looks like. ,652000
Margaret winces. ,3530
She gets busy, penciling in LARGE OVAL EYES. Then -- quick marks for the mouth and nose. ,10200
Impatient, Jane spies on Walter's canvas. ,336000
JANE Hey! Your canvas is blank! WALTER Er, you can't rush inspiration -- MARGARET Jane! Don't bother Mr. Keane. ,111000
You know creativity has to well up from the inside... ,77800000
WALTER Don't worry. ,350000
She's not bothering me...! Walter leaves Jane. ,863000
He points at Margaret's canvas. ,4280000
WALTER There's something I gotta ask you. ,1370000
What's with the big crazy eyes...? ,20900000
MARGARET I believe things can be seen in eyes. ,24900000
They're the windows of the soul -- 12. ,12000000
WALTER Yeah, but, c'mon! You draw 'em like pancakes! I mean, they're WAY out of proportion! He's having fun, but she remains serious. ,36000
MARGARET Eyes are how I express my emotions. ,53300
That's how I've always drawn them. (EARNEST) When I was little, I had surgery that left me deaf for a period. ,38600
I couldn't hear, so I found myself staring... ,5750000
She smiles shyly. ,2820000
Understanding, he smiles back. ,695000
Then -- VOICE Walter? ,1400
Hey -- Walt! Walter spins, startled. ,12100
A FRIENDLY GUY in a suit strolls up. ,216000
FRIENDLY GUY I thought that was you! WALTER (EMBARRASSED) Oh! Uh... er, hi, Don. ,242000
FRIENDLY GUY Boy, I'm glad to see you! Have we heard back from the city, on that setback? ,314000
My guys really need the variance, for the first floor retail. ,50100
Walter is mortified. ,521000
He turns away from Margaret. ,124000
WALTER Um... we should hear from Permits by Thursday. ,951000
FRIENDLY GUY Yeah? ,83000
Well that's terrif'! I'll tell the architects! Pleased, the guy cheerily strides away. ,529000
ON WALTER AND MARGARET He is stricken. ,19400
Something ominous just happened. ,131000
MARGARET What was that?? 13. ,14700000
WALTER (ASHAMED) I -- I didn't want you to know... ,138000
A long, horrible pause. ,5740000
Walter's face turns gray. ,204000
We SLOWLY PUSH IN. This revelation is churning. ,142000
Agony. ,7410000
WALTER I'm in commercial real estate. ,2700000
A stunned beat. ,1290000
MARGARET You're a -- Realtor? ,456000
WALTER (CONTRITE) YES! A hugely successful Realtor! Top earner in the Downtown office three years running! MARGARET And you're... ashamed? ,3050
WALTER Of course! Any blockhead can arrange a sublet! (HEARTFELT) All I ever wanted was to support myself as an artist... (SAD; BEAT) I tried to make a clean break, but couldn't cut it. ,26200
I'm just a goddam Sunday painter. ,12800
An amateur. ,1540000
Margaret looks at him, touched by his vulnerability. ,1920000
CUT TO: INT. MARGARET'S APARTMENT - DUSK End of the day. ,499000
Golden light slants in through the windows of this small tidy apartment. ,38900
Margaret holds it for Walter, who chivalrously staggers in, carrying all her supplies: Easel, paints, cans. ,31800
He carefully puts it all down -- then turns. ,1150000
Walter stares at Margaret, their faces caught in the warm light. ,19500
Then, enchanted, he kisses her. ,165000
Margaret smiles, captivated. ,407000
Caught in his glow. ,7390000
The moment could last forever... 14. ,32700
IN THE DOORWAY Jane stares unhappily. ,4010
Threatened. ,11900000
JANE A-hem! ON MARGARET She turns, startled. ,33700
Feeling guilty, Margaret rushes from Walter. ,78700
Busying herself, she skims through the MAIL. Jane shakes her head and marches out. ,332000
Margaret flips through envelopes -- until one stops her. ,1890
On edge, she slowly removes an official DOCUMENT. She scans it... and her face drops. ,2850000
Crushed. ,13200000
Something terrible... ,322000
Walter is worried. ,632000
WALTER What's wrong...? ,59400000
MARGARET (SOFT) Frank wants to take away Jane. ,732000
He says I'm an unfit mother... ,348000
WALTER You're a perfect mother. ,1360000
MARGARET He told the court Jane doesn't have a proper home. ,1950000
It's beyond my abilities as a single woman... ,5610000
Margaret trails off, shaken. ,807000
Walter gulps unsurely. ,18100
Then, he takes her in his arms. ,2590000
We SLOWLY PUSH IN. WALTER Marry me. ,320000
MARGARET (SHE GASPS) Walter! I -- WALTER (he puts a finger to her lips) Shh. ,15400
Don't think of a reason to say no. 'Cause I've got a million reasons to say yes. (he gives a winning smile) I know it makes no sense! (MORE) 15. ,177000
WALTER (CONT'D) But just think of the fun we'll have..! And I'll take care of you girls. ,38800
Margaret stammers, speechless. ,125000
She doesn't know what to say. ,8570000
Walter pulls out his ace. ,5060000
In a debonair move, he creakily drops to his knee. ,617000
He exudes a hammy, wonderful romance: WALTER Margaret, I'm on my knee! C'mon, whatdya say? ,84
Let's get married! We can be in Hawaii by the weekend. ,1430000
MARGARET "Hawaii"? ,3350000
M-marriage? (EMOTIONAL) Walter, I'm crazy about you... but I'm overwhelmed. ,73600
Why would we go to Hawaii?! WALTER (BEGUILING) Because you're a princess... and you deserve to get married in paradise. ,43300
CLOSEUP - MARGARET Margaret shudders, tears in her eyes. ,11200
Hawaiian MUSIC begins... ,4600000
DISSOLVE TO: STOCK FOOTAGE - DAY A propeller-driven PAN AM airplane soars through the sky. ,925
EXT. HAWAII - DAY Hawaii, 1958. ,902000
Heaven on earth. ,12200000
Blossoming flowers, rare birds, lush greenery. ,168000
Margaret is experiencing total bliss. ,19000
We widen. ,16600
She and Walter stand in front of a waterfall, getting married. ,932000
Jane is Maid-of-Honor. ,722000
A PRIEST smiles, and Walter places a ring on Margaret's finger. ,300000
EXT. BEACH - SUNSET Margaret and Walter lie on the sand, making out. ,154000
Cuddling, running their fingers along each other's bodies. ,77200
She stares up, endlessly happy. ,22800
MARGARET You're right... this is paradise. ,30900000
Only God could make those colors. ,53300000
WALTER I knew you'd love it. 16. ,35100000
MARGARET Oh, can't we stay here forever?? ,97300
WALTER Well, I don't know about forever. ,47300000
But maybe... ,996000
I can arrange another week. ,732000
EXT. HOTEL GROUNDS - DAY Thatched umbrellas, Polynesian fun. ,10200
Margaret is set-up, drawing PORTRAITS of the GUESTS. Walter regales them as they wait. ,94200
Joking, gregariously handing out Mai-Tais. ,13500
Margaret finishes a picture. ,2930000
She beams at Walter... then signs the picture "KEANE." Walter gapes, astonished at this gesture. ,12200
Margaret lock eyes with him. ,238000
She smiles girlishly, radiating happiness. ,9890
CUT TO: INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - DAY Old school Cantonese: Dragons and red lacquer. ,21000
Margaret eats lunch with Dee-Ann, showing off SNAPSHOTS from the trip. ,41100
MARGARET This is a waterfall... the air was so fresh you could taste it. ,125000
Here's an ancient altar... that statue is Kane, the god of creation. ,41200
I said a prayer to him. ,4240000
Oh! Here's Walter and Janie, building a sandcastle -- Dee-Ann raises an eyebrow. ,21500
DEE-ANN This is all happening mighty quick. ,238000
In the time you moved here, I've had two dates. ,50300000
You're already married. ,320000
MARGARET (SHE GIGGLES) I thought there was a void in my life. ,1390000
Walter's filled it. ,115000
DEE-ANN Walter's filled a lot of things. ,186000
He's diddled every skirt on the art circuit. ,12200000
They just want art that touches them! CUT TO: ANIMATION WALTER'S VOICE And then... we could sell it anywhere!! EVERYWHERE! 60's-style MADISON AVENUE GRAPHICS: A still of a HARDWARE STORE. Mops, light bulbs, then -- BING! -- framed KEANES. A PHARMACY. Aspirin, candy bars -- BING! -- framed KEANES. A GAS STATION. Tires, motor oil, and -- BING! -- KEANES. INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY An aisle of Sundries: Plastic toys, beach balls... ,2
WALTER What the hell's going on here?!! MARGARET (TIMID) Uh... ,208000
Dee-Ann was just... she... ,164000
Margaret trails off. ,807000
Walter thinks, then SNAPS. WALTER You KNOW I don't like anyone seeing my work before it's done! Walter rushes to the Waif, then for show grabs up the wet brush and quickly starts to "finish" the painting. ,585000
Suddenly -- an odd expression crosses his face. ,209000
He eyeballs the canvas, realizing he doesn't know what to do. ,385000
A furtive glance. ,54200
Then, unbowed, he hastily dips the brush and slaps a little black onto the shaded background. ,26600
Walter spins, victorious. ,183000
WALTER There! CUT TO: INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER The three sit silently, tension thick, sipping gin fizzes. ,20
Nobody speaks. ,55300
Walter finishes his drink and pours a fresh one. ,110000
CUT TO: INT. FOYER - NIGHT They are drunk and SCREAMING. Walter pushes Dee-Ann out the door. 63. ,93900
OUTSIDE Dee-Ann GUNS the engine and squeals away. ,271000
The car peels down the very long driveway. ,1120000
Margaret and Walter watch the car disappear into the distance. ,82600000
Without looking over, Walter speaks. ,1240000
WALTER I don't want her ever invited here again. ,493000
Margaret nods, terribly sad. ,12300
MARGARET I won't. ,55700000
CUT TO: INT. MASTER BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT Margaret and Walter lie in bed, awake. ,94500
Arms crossed. ,347000
Unspeaking. ,20200
EXT. WOODSIDE HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY Margaret and 13-YEAR-OLD JANE play on the lawn with the poodle. ,1430
Jane laughs as the dog chases in circles. ,343000
JANE Go, Rembrandt! Get the ball! She tumbles, and Rembrandt licks her ear. ,32900
She giggles. ,69200
MARGARET Okay, honey. ,2340000
I have to go work. 64. ,141000000
JANE Can I come? (an awkward silence) No. I can never come. ,177000
No! I shouldn't even ask. ,4060000
Jane glares glumly. ,40600
Margaret peers hopelessly at her daughter... then goes inside. ,131000
INT. WOODSIDE HOUSE Margaret strolls to her studio. ,21500
WE SEE the poodle scampering behind her on its cute little legs. ,170000
She enters the INT. PAINTING ROOM Margaret doesn't notice the tiny dog follow her in. ,72900
She LOCKS the door, then turns -- surprised. ,1550000
MARGARET Where did you appear from? ,307000
Didn't you hear? ,2300000
No visitors! Rembrandt wags his tail, his little eyes bright. ,8200
Margaret peers. ,1370
MARGARET Is this what it's come to? ,321000000
You're the only living soul I can tell my secret? (she lowers her voice) Well -- I painted them all! (she shudders with release) It's TRUE! I did every single one -- She gestures, then catches sight of a Walter street scene. ,677
MARGARET Well, every one except that street scene. (BEAT) But I did the rest. ,8620000
Every Big Eye! And nobody will ever know. ,62800
But YOU. Rembrandt pants and BARKS. Margaret chuckles, then goes to work. ,26400
She pulls a CURTAIN across the sliding glass door. ,483000
At her easel, she squirts a tube into a well and starts mixing colors. ,17500
Rembrandt jumps on the couch. ,655
MARGARET No you don't! It's nice to have company, but that sofa is new. (she pushes him off) Let's find you some carpet to lay on. 65. ,52100
Margaret goes over to a CLOSET. Rembrandt follows, curious. ,35600
IN THE CLOSET Margaret turns on the bare bulb inside. ,33700
It's filled with old easels... cans... junk... ,1150000
MARGARET I think there's a scrap back here... ,98400
She rummages, sliding the junk aside. ,44600
In back is a TATTERED WOODEN CRATE. Hm? MARGARET Well what's this? ,16100
Margaret swings the bulb closer. ,737000
The crate is covered with SHIPPING INSTRUCTIONS and international markings. ,529000
Margaret's interest is piqued. ,4490000
She tugs at the lid, pulling it off. ,75100
Revealing inside a STACK OF STREET SCENE PAINTINGS. Ten or fifteen of Walter's canvases. ,7440
Or so it seems. ,928000
TIGHT - MARGARET She peers closer. ,275000
TIGHT - THE PAINTINGS The top painting is a typical Parisian street scene: Cobble stones, a man carrying baguettes, an old lady selling roses... ,2660
But down in the bottom corner is the signature: "S. ,741000
CENIC" TIGHT - MARGARET She sucks in her breath, shocked. ,69700
She examines the painting. ,13800000
Then, she hurriedly grabs the next canvas. ,61500
It's another sunlit scene: A quaint Parisian cafe, a man playing accordian, and in the bottom right corner... the signature: "S. ,8840
CENIC" WHAT?! Margaret grabs the next canvas. "S. ,42800
CENIC" The next canvas. ,16200000
The next canvas! They all are signed "S. ,41800000
CENIC" Margaret starts hyperventilating. 66. ,12200
She thinks, then suddenly bolts from the closet. ,3380000
INT. PAINTING ROOM Margaret races, rushing up to Walter's painted street scene, hung on the wall. ,11700
We PUSH IN TIGHT, as she shoves her face up to the canvas, so close we can see the brushstrokes -- As we MOVE IN TO THE SIGNATURE. Simply, "W. ,688
KEANE" Margaret's face is flushed. ,2840000
She gazes at the name... then rushes back to her work area. ,626000
She manically hunts: Brushes, tubes, rags -- and an EXACTO KNIFE. Ah! She runs back to Walter's painting. ,21
Heart pounding, she grazes the knife up against the signature, then DIGS. And -- the "W. ,12300
KEANE" flecks off. ,51400000
Revealing... underneath... the name "S. ,3840000
CENIC" CLOSEUP - MARGARET She trembles, overcome. ,8910
Music SWELLS. Her eyes spin back -- SERIES OF QUICK FLASHBACKS: Walter painting at the Palace of Fine Arts. ,11500
His canvas is blank. ,3140000
Walter in the apartment, signing his name to a finished piece. ,2110000
Walter spattering paint on his clothes. ,414000
Walter the day we met him. ,235000
He shows off a rack of finished paintings at the Sunday Art Show. ,694000
BACK ON MARGARET She collapses. ,3150000
CUT TO: INT. WOODSIDE HOUSE - THAT EVENING A grandfather clock says 10:15. ,43000
Margaret sits gloomily, staring at the clock. ,12000
Clutching a drink. ,212000
LATER 2:30 a.m. ,94800000
Margaret still stares at the clock. ,18700
She's stewing. ,479000
Suddenly, keys in the door. ,1580000
Walter swings in, tanked and full of life. ,92200
He skids across the marble, humming to himself -- when -- he's startled by his wife. ,12300
He jerks. 67. ,1770000
WALTER M-Maggie! What're you doin' up? ,53800
Margaret glares. ,277000
Not speaking. ,708000
He shrugs. ,87100
WALTER I had a helluva night. ,6960
Worked three or four clubs. (he winks, loosey-goosey) Stumbled onto some hot gossip: Madame Chiang Kai-shek is coming to town! Straight from Taipei! I think we should present her with a painting -- get Dick to flack it... (HE THINKS) Or the heck with Dick. ,2
I met a new guy at UPI... ,875000
MARGARET Maybe you should give her one of your street scenes. ,376000
WALTER (HAZY) You think? ,330000
I dunno -- I thought you could whip off a doodle of Chinatown. ,5910
With a cute little kid, sort of a big- eyed slanty-eyed thing... ,309000
Margaret's anger is raging. ,15100
She glares, steely. ,3250000
MARGARET No, Walter. ,2340000
She's a dignitary. ,10200000
Doesn't she deserve a piece that comes straight from you? (SHARP) From your experience??? ,489000
WALTER Yeah? ,3780
She probably doesn't have a Parisian street scene hanging in her palace. ,122000
Margaret nods, as if they've settled something. ,36500
She turns to walk away -- then suddenly SPINS. MARGARET Unless Madame Chiang Kai-shek already has a Cenic. ,390
ON WALTER He freezes up. ,97900
Suddenly sober, smacked to reality. 68. ,12300
WALTER "Cenic"...? ,25900
Uh, what's that? ,11800000
Margaret stares, eyes sharp. ,134000
MARGARET Cenic is the name of the artist who did all your early paintings. ,1230000
But she shakes her head. ,1010000
MARGARET The more you lie, the smaller you seem. ,123000
WALTER (unyielding, scrambling) How DARE you accuse me of lying! I'm proud of my early Cenics! MARGARET Then why do you paint over the name? ,11400
Walter gasps, floored. ,15700
Margaret bores in. ,2330000
MARGARET A bit of advice: Don't use a water- base over an oil. ,1110000
It flecks off. ,10800
Walter cowers. ,6820
WALTER You sound crazy! For God's sake. ,7000000
You've... you've SEEN me paint!!!! MARGARET No, I haven't. (QUIET; STRONG) I always thought I had... but it's some kind of... mirage. ,362000
From a distance you look like a painter, but up close... there's nothing there. 69. ,4210000
CLOSEUP - WALTER All life drains from his face. ,2780000
His eyes go glazed. ,29100
He speaks mechanically. ,1680000
Tiredly... ,77300
WALTER I studied art in Paris. ,14900000
I went to school at the Beaux-Arts. ,108000
The Grand Chaumiere. ,232000
I spent hours in the Louvre, gazing at the greatness of the Masters... ,12800
MARGARET Walter? ,15000
She winces, pained. ,13800
MARGARET Have you even been to Paris? ,26500000
Walter blanches. ,6
He shakes, broken up. ,58000
He looks away, then staggers to a chair. ,22500
He falls into it. ,12500000
Trembling. ,2100000
Not able to look her in the eye... ,4250000
WALTER I wanted... ,12700000
I so wanted to be an artist. ,762000
But -- it just never turned out good. ,2260000
Margaret stares, seething. ,38900
Then, without comment, she storms away. ,4720000
She SLAMS the door shut. ,556000
BANG! Walter doesn't move. ,207000
CUT TO: INT. KITCHEN - NEXT MORNING Margaret makes Jane breakfast, scrambling up eggs. ,96500
Jane glances over her shoulder -- and notices Walter in the living room, asleep on the couch. ,22900
An awkward pause. ,10100000
Jane says nothing. ,13500000
INT. MASTER BEDROOM - LATER Margaret is making the bed. ,126000
Straightening the pillows. ,10600000
In the b.g., Walter silently creeps into view. ,208000
Shamefully standing in the doorway. ,175000
Not speaking... ,689000
Margaret knows he's there, but doesn't acknowledge his presence. ,14400000
Finally, without making eye contact -- 70. ,1050000
MARGARET I don't want you sleeping in this room any longer. ,10100000
I -- I can't keep living these lies. (SHARP) There's three extra bedrooms. ,10000
Go pick one. ,53400000
INT. HOUSE - LATER Margaret sits, unmoving, trapped in the big house. ,49100
Outside, a JAPANESE GARDENER trims the hedges. ,102000
Margaret stares at the walls, a smothering Walter Hall of Fame: Framed magazine articles on Walter, smugly posed with the Waifs. ,3
She swallows, then gently opens a dresser drawer. ,38100
Inside is an ORIGINAL WAIF from long ago. ,49000
A small oil of Jane, when she was a toddler. ,2380000
Margaret stares... and then her face slowly crumbles. ,1750000
INT. PAINTING ROOM - DAY Margaret huddles with a SKETCHPAD. Rembrandt is at her feet. ,7330
She's drawing. ,10000000
She looks up, as Walter anxiously enters. ,2160000
He's holding a drink. ,5160000
He clears his throat. ,28500
WALTER What are you working on? ,30700000
MARGARET A new MDH. Something for me. ,364000
It's about a woman trapped in an uncaring world. ,23300
I call it, "Escape." Walter bites his lip, afraid to talk. ,240000
WALTER I figured out a solution to our problems. ,48400000
MARGARET What? ,18200
WALTER Teach me. (BEAT) Show me your tricks. ,10100000
Then you can pass off the Waifs, and we won't be lying anymore. ,85700
She looks up in disbelief. 71. ,452000
MARGARET And then -- YOU'LL paint them? ,2150000
WALTER Sure! Why not? ,10400000
MARGARET (OFFENDED) Walter, this isn't paint-by-numbers! You think it's easy?! It took me years to learn -- WALTER Y-you're right! (SHEEPISH) But you know me! I'm a quick study. ,13000
And I've got the basics... ,4430000
He trails off, unsure where this is going. ,2110000
Trying to rouse her, Walter rushes to an easel and throws up a blank canvas. ,17400
She eyeballs him. ,639000
MARGARET If you knew the basics, you wouldn't be at the easel. ,862000
You have to sketch it first! Walter tightens, feeling stupid. ,322000
He lets go of the canvas. ,1530000
Margaret stares, deciding. ,384000
Then, she tosses him a PAD. Walter catches it. ,1540000
Slowly, he crosses over... ,397000
ANGLE - MARGARET AND WALTER They peer at each other, like a Mexican standoff. ,142000
Then, he nervously picks up a pencil. ,770000
WALTER So...? ,25300
What's first? ,17600000
MARGARET I dunno. ,49000
You tell me. ,7730000
You're the creator. ,6390000
He frowns. ,170000
WALTER It's a -- Keane. ,3050000
MARGARET Oh, a Keane! How witty. (SARCASTIC) You know, when we met all those years ago, I never would've imagined in my wildest dreams that one day -- 72. ,2440
WALTER YEAH YEAH! Point taken. ,8280000
I'm standing here naked and humiliated in front of you. ,1410000
Look... can we just do a crying child? ,9650000
She gazes at him. ,6400
Fingering her pencil... ,10600000
Trying to jump-start things, he starts to draw a circle -- MARGARET How old is the subject? ,232000
C'mon, it's a head -- MARGARET It matters! A young child's head is round. ,148000
An older child's head is oval! He feels pressured. ,1800000
Hand shaking, he draws a crooked circle. ,87600
WALTER The child is this old! (ANGRY) You're trying to make this difficult -- MARGARET NO I'M NOT! Every line is a decision! (IMPASSIONED) It's easy to talk about art, but it's not easy to MAKE art!! DISSOLVE TO: INT. PAINTING ROOM - MONTAGE: Margaret easily outlines a head, then two circles for eyes. ,7170
Walter tries copying, but his eyes are misshapen. ,144000
Again, Walter copies, but he's wobbly. ,381000
Angry, he scratches it out. ,164000
Margaret tries to help, guiding his hand. ,1250000
Insulted, he pushes her off. ,1830000
He CRUMPLES the page. ,59300
NEW TACTIC: Walter grabs her sketch. ,14000
He puts it on a LIGHT- TABLE. Despairing, he starts to trace it.. ,500000
LATER Walter finally paints. ,8600000
We can't see the canvas, but he's very meticulous. ,2420000
His expression quite earnest. ,469000
He adds a final flourish... and then... a flicker of pride crosses his face. ,25200
He smiles. 73. ,3040000
We slowly MOVE AROUND... to REVEAL HIS PAINTING. And... it's... absolutely dreadful. ,508000
Kindergarten quality. ,12800
Then, he furtively glances at Margaret's work. ,393000
Comparing... ,30
The realization slowly sinks in. ,3290000
He has no ability. ,71700000
A sadness swells into fury... and suddenly Walter GRABS HIS CANVAS and SMASHES IT AGAINST THE EASEL. CRASH!! The canvas SHREDS. The frame blasts into pieces! Walter spins. ,739
He glares at one of Margaret's finished Waifs... then explodes, even more enraged. ,12200
HE PICKS UP MARGARET'S PAINTING AND STARTS TO SWING IT AT THE WALL -- MARGARET (O.S.) Walter!! Huh? ,187000
He lurches, startled. ,12700
ACROSS THE ROOM Margaret stares him down. ,5060000
Sweaty, chest heaving, Walter staggers towards her. ,12200
His face scowls, untamed. ,34900
He clenches his fist, like he might attack MARGARET -- Then -- he SCREAMS and smashes her CANVAS. BAM!!! The painting RIPS apart. ,408000
Walter KICKS his foot through the remains, then spins and charges from the room. ,17600
CUT TO: INT. KEANE GALLERY - DAY TOURIST FAMILIES mill about. ,169000
Suddenly the door SLAMS open. ,2110000
Walter bolts in, wild-eyed. ,201000
A bit deranged. ,14000000
The families gawk -- glancing from Walter to his photograph all over: "WALTER KEANE! THE WORLD'S TOP-SELLING ARTIST!" Walter ignores them. ,8
He rushes a buxom REDHEADED CLERK. WALTER How's SALES? REDHEAD CLERK Oh, you know. ,12400
Mondays -- Walter MUTTERS strangely. ,35100
He snatches some paper and starts scribbling. ,923000
Then he runs into the 74. ,166000
STORAGE ROOM Walter agitatedly paces, circling the stacks of PRINTS. WALTER How many posters are back here? ,1620
REDHEAD CLERK Exactly? ,1170000
I dunno, 3,000 or -- WALTER Does the printer owe us more? ,506000
Do we owe him?? ,89900
REDHEAD CLERK Uh, let me -- WALTER What about the OILS?! Are there more at the warehouse? ,998000
REDHEAD CLERK Mr. Keane, I'd have to make a -- WALTER For the LOVE OF MUD! What am I PAYING you for? ,47700
The girl freezes, rattled. ,749000
Walter spins, flipping out. ,198000
WALTER Hypothetical question: If you were a man, would you marry Kim Novak or my wife? ,40600
WALTER Okay! Different question! If I got crippled and had to stop painting, how long before the gallery ran out of inventory and went belly up?? ,37200
REDHEAD CLERK (RATTLED) Do you want a glass of water, Mr. Keane? ,28800
Walter sighs. ,5570
His thoughts drift away... ,781000
WALTER What's it all mean? ,1320000000
Why are we put on this earth? ,57700
A 100 years from now, will people even know we existed...? 75. ,4340000
REDHEAD CLERK (UNCOMFORTABLE) I -- I don't understand. ,187000
You'll always be famous. ,125000
You were on the Jack Paar Show... (she glances away) Er, excuse me, sir. ,115000
The girl hurries away, to ring up some customers. ,1150000
Walter silently watches. ,171000
At the register, the Tourists buy a print. ,1410000
A "Madonna and Child," MDH-style. ,2470000
BAMMM! Walter's eyes bulge, like he's been stung. ,97400
WALTER It's not even mine! It's one of hers. ,3250000
Aching, he staggers off. ,281000
Sweating, woozy, he sits at a table. ,12700
Distracted, he glances down at a newspaper... ,28600
INSERT - NEWSPAPER There's an article on the 1964 NEW YORK WORLD'S FAIR. A headline says "CONSTRUCTION RACES TOWARD APRIL OPENING" TIGHT - WALTER His eyes narrow, piqued. ,29200
World's Fair??? ,214000000
He leans in... ,46500
CUT TO: INT. BISTRO - NIGHT A return to the charming bistro Margaret and Walter went to all those years ago, on their first date. ,34200
The Maitre'd BEAMS. MAITRE'D Ah! Monsieur and Madame Keane! Delighted! Always such an honor! ANGLE on the Keanes. ,59
They are sullen. ,1230000
At wit's end. ,404000
AT THE TABLE - LATER They stiffly sit at their old table. ,2370000
He snarls, eyes black. ,82600
WALTER This doesn't change anything. ,2590000
MARGARET (trying to hold her ground) I know the truth. 76. ,140000
WALTER Who cares?! This is all your fault! Maybe it's time to shake things up. ,177000
Start puttin' my name on the MDH's. ,151000
Margaret is astonished. ,56500
A fury crosses her face. ,72300
MARGARET NO! Absolutely NOT!! I still hate myself for giving you the Waifs! WALTER Quiet! Lower your voice -- MARGARET Oh, I'll talk as LOUD AS I WANT -- WALTER NO YOU WON'T! Or -- (FLAILING) I'll have you whacked! She jerks, flabbergasted. ,12
MARGARET What??! WALTER If you tell ANYONE, if you squeal, I'll take you out! I -- I know people. ,665000
Remember Banducci's cousin? ,22200
The liquor wholesaler? ,250000
MARGARET You're threatening me...?! Fine, kill me! My God, I've kept our secret for years! I've never once -- (CRYING) Do you know what it's been like for me? ,19000
I don't have any friends. ,73200000
I've lied to my own child... ,1110000
Margaret shudders, distraught. ,22000
Mascara runs down her cheeks. ,223000
Walter squirms, uneasy with this. ,19700
WALTER Christ, wipe your face! You look a mess. (BEAT) It's life imitating art! A crying Keane! He hands her his handkerchief. ,5920
She dabs at her eyes. ,124000
A looming quiet. 77. ,236000
MARGARET What do you want, Walter? ,7430000
Everything with you is calculated. ,2650000
We're back where we had our first date... ,1850000
We MOVE IN TIGHT on them. ,103000
He drops his voice. ,272000
Dead serious. ,268000
WALTER Look, I don't deny I need you. ,44400000
You're the one with the gift. (BEAT; HUSHED) Right now there's a shot... ,10600000
God, I'm shaking I'm so excited. ,2260000
The New York World's Fair. 70 million visitors. ,128000000
Opening day, I unveil my MASTERPIECE! She is flummoxed. ,1530000
MARGARET What masterpiece? ,548000
WALTER Exactly! What have I been missing all this time?! Da Vinci has his Mona Lisa... ,129000
Renoir has his Boatmen's Lunch... but where's my defining statement? ,24400000
MARGARET You sound insane. ,3100000
Artists don't announce a masterpiece -- WALTER Why not?! Didn't Michelangelo know he was hittin' a homer, when he was on his back painting the Sistine Chapel? ,3390
MARGARET He worked on that for FOUR YEARS! WALTER Posterity, baby...!! She empties her drink. ,10000
WALTER And here's the best part. ,72700000
It's for Unicef! Unicef is sponsoring the Hall of Education. ,417000
Aw, we can finally give back to the children of the world!! Margaret stares, wavering... ,253000
CUT TO: 78. ,402
STOCK FOOTAGE: The 1964 WORLD'S FAIR READIES TO OPEN. Men on 109 cranes hammer away. ,1470
Fantastic, futuristic pavilions rise. ,18000
The Hall of Education gets erected... ,11200000
INT. PAINTING ROOM - DAY ANGLE - An INSANELY BIG, BLANK CANVAS. It's 8 feet across, filling half the room. ,2610
Margaret is in the throes of hastily creating the MASTERPIECE. Sketches are tacked everywhere. ,12200
Margaret is chain smoking, sleep-deprived. ,251000
The DESIGN is a staggering multiracial CROWD of children, mournful, extending to the horizon. ,12100
Walter enters, silently scrutinizing. ,12100
MARGARET It's too big. ,53800000
Why'd you promise them Cinerama size? ,5560000
WALTER Because it has to encompass all children. ,7680000
All races! One hundred stricken faces! Marching to infinity! The ultimate Walter Keane! (BEAT) At least that's what I told Life Magazine. ,519
Margaret ignores this. ,3230000
Walter does a rehearsed turn. ,278000
WALTER Oh, a publisher says it's good timing to put out a coffee table book. ,220000
You know, classy: "Tomorrow's Masters." (AWKWARDLY "CASUAL") So they need my... uh, early portfolio. ,50000
My artistic evolution... ,1230000
We PUSH IN... as she struggles to contain her frustration. ,117000
Suddenly -- she SNAPS. MARGARET You're right! Where are your preliminary sketches?? ,11200
All that time in art school, and somehow we waylaid your youthful experiments! The half- finished charcoals, the struggles... ,9440
WALTER (a bit off-balance) I know you're being sarcastic, but these are all good ideas. ,263000
Berlin war orphans... early self-portraits... 79. ,161000
Her eyes narrow. ,3650000
MARGARET Get out of here. ,12
I'm trying to work. ,4880000
She brusquely spins away, back to the canvas. ,34900
He shoots her an uncertain, dirty look. ,31500
What just happened? ,593000
CUT TO: INT. HOUSE - NIGHT Teenage Jane wanders through the house. ,1040000
Shouting. ,16500000
JANE Mom, what's for dinner? (NO RESPONSE) Mom! Are you home...? ,80800000
No sign of Margaret. ,7120000
Jane tries the door of the PAINTING ROOM. As always, it's locked. ,1190000
Hm... ,16700000
Jane sneakily glances around. ,16900
Quickly, she stands on a chair and reaches above the door sill. ,735000
She feels around... and finds a KEY. Ah! Hurriedly, Jane UNLOCKS the door and lets herself in. ,1410
INT. PAINTING ROOM - SAME TIME The room is a madhouse of WAIFS. Jane takes it all in. ,92000
Her face darkens. ,30600000
Then, heavy breathing. ,48600
Margaret is asleep, curled up under the almost-finished Masterpiece. ,27000
Jane leans in. ,225000
Slowly, Margaret rouses -- then suddenly: MARGARET W-what are you doing in here --? (BLINKING; HALF-AWAKE) This is -- Walter's studio! (DISCOMBOBULATED) You have to leave! Jane peers sadly at her mother. ,8
JANE Mom... ,33100
MARGARET Jane, you don't know anything!! Jane's face tightens. ,49400
Insulted. ,13300000
JANE I'm not a child anymore. 80. ,25700000
Angry, Jane runs out. ,2800000
Margaret stares after her -- completely remorseful. ,63400
She knows she did the wrong thing. ,3420000
Suddenly, she runs after Jane and grabs her tightly. ,44300
Overcome, Margaret starts weeping. ,5770000
Jane starts crying too. ,374000
CUT TO: INSERT - LIFE MAGAZINE A gargantuan spread. ,294000
The LIFE ARTICLE is titled "The Man Who Paints Those Big Eyes." We PULL OUT... ,1410000
INT. NEW YORK TIMES - DAY Starchy John Canaday reads the article, gaping in utter disbelief. ,5450
His desk says "JOHN CANADAY, SENIOR ART CRITIC." He also has Walter's BOOK, "Tomorrow's Masters Series." We WIDEN, revealing he's in the busy New York Times NEWSROOM. CANADAY Four... five... ,61
SIX pages! Is there something here I'm missing? (UPSET) He's like -- the Hula-Hoop! He just won't go away...! He flips a page -- then his jaw drops. ,20900
CANADAY "Will be unveiled in the Grand Pavilion of the Hall of Education... internationally celebrated artist has been selected... will represent the aspirations of children worldwide --" (HE GASPS) Oh this is ABSURD! He GRABS for his phone. ,512
INT. WORLD'S FAIR HALL OF EDUCATION - DAY A panel flicks, and the huge empty space lights up. ,9880
It's overwhelmingly cavernous, a bright, freshly-painted Space Age spectacular. ,153000
Up high hangs The Masterpiece and its 100 kids. ,2010000
A sign says "TOMORROW FOREVER." Below, two tiny figures walk in: Canaday and an obtuse CIVIC LEADER. Canaday stares up in horror. ,16900
Utterly stupefied. ,4310
CANADAY And WHO was on the selection committee? ,1480000
CIVIC LEADER Oh! Well there wasn't a "committee," per se. ,380000
We just had a luncheon with me, Ed, Jerome, Jerome's wife... (MORE) 81. ,105000
CIVIC LEADER (CONT'D) (HE THINKS) Though technically, we didn't invite submissions. ,3360
Mr. Keane just contacted us directly! Canaday reacts, smoldering. ,542
INT. NEW YORK MANSION - DAY A STRING QUARTET PLAYS at a GRAND PARTY. It's completely fabulous -- an old-money mansion filled with stuffy BLUE BLOODS, all tuxes and gowns. ,989
In the doorway appear Walter and Margaret. ,130000
They're dressed to kill. ,639000
Walter's radiant -- but Margaret looks like she's about to emotionally disintegrate. ,5200
Suddenly, he WHISPERS. WALTER Stop. ,331000
Let us appreciate this moment. ,8270000
This is what we've worked toward our whole lives: Rarified air. ,459000
Inside this house are the movers and shakers. ,95000
Kennedys. ,2580000
Rockefellers. (MISTY-EYED) Until today, we've always been on the outside, looking in. ,66800
But when we enter... we will belong. ,3170000
MARGARET I was happier selling paintings in the park. ,17100
He gapes, appalled. ,12100
WALTER You are one crazy bitch. ,274000
Walter spins and grandly enters. ,10900
It's thirty-five dollars. 7. ,1
FANCY LADY It's quite gestural. ,1
CUT TO: INSERT - SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER The front page! A small headline says "BISTRO BRAWL: BANDUCCI AND ARTIST SLUGFEST." Below are two PHOTOS: Walter mid-punch, and Banducci unconscious, sticking out of the Big Eye. ,1

INT. TAXI - NIGHT Margaret rides in the back seat, smiling, her gaze faraway. ,1
The big-bosomed Blonde turns to Walter. ,1
Walter starts rubbing against her, dancing sensually. ,1
He kneels, then smiles gently at Jane. ,1

Dee-Ann watches the drinkmaking. ,1
INT. PAINTING ROOM A room full of MDHs and Keanes. ,1
WALTER You and your whole non-representational crowd are FRAUDS!! DEE-ANN SHUT UP! You're so full of shit, Walter! WALTER Get outta my house! My big house! (LIVID) Go back to sellin' your coat hanger sculptures on Fisherman's Wharf! DEE-ANN Fuck you! Dee-Ann staggers outside, then hops in her car. ,1
WALTER Huhhh? (spinning his lie) Urgh... oh! CENIC! (he laughs crazily) Cenic was my nickname in Paris! All my art school pals loved my scenic views, so they called me "Scenic"! But since those Frogs can't pronounce a hard "e," I became "Cenic." He looks up at her hopefully. ,1
He grabs two CHAMPAGNES from a server. ,12000
WALTER So maybe you have problems with the choices we made... but -- c'mon! Wednesday, the World's Fair opens. ,256000
Thursday, our book goes on sale! MARGARET Friday, I file for divorce. ,344000
WALTER Aw, why are you always so miserable? (IRRITATED) Well, I'm gonna enjoy my afternoon! The HOSTESS is a bejeweled dowager. ,12300
Walter makes a beeline. 82. ,199000
WALTER Mrs. ,8240
Teasdale! Walter Keane. ,1030000
I just want to thank you for hosting this absolutely enchanting soiree. ,188000
Walter takes the woman's hand. ,1760000
She smiles stiffly, silently horrified. ,12300
She glances around for help. ,370000
She catches a SOCIETY MAN's eye, and he hurries over. ,12600000
SOCIETY MAN Hey, Keane. ,459000
Have you seen the Times? ,2430000
WALTER Er, no. ,3580000
Honestly, I've been so busy all day preparing for this lovely -- SOCIETY MAN I think you should read the Times. ,12900
The Man gestures. ,23100000
Perplexed, the Keanes follow him into a INT. DEN - SAME TIME The room looks like a hunting lodge. ,3360
On the desk are all the DAILY PAPERS. Walter grabs the NEW YORK TIMES -- then gasps. ,433000
INSERT - NEW YORK TIMES It's open to a reproduction of "Tomorrow Forever," above a scathing REVIEW. THE KEANES stare, then turn pale. ,30300
INSERT - REVIEW A BLIZZARD of WORDS assaults us: "GROTESQUE" "APPALLING" "TASTELESS" "Lowest common denominator" MARGARET AND WALTER'S faces drop, terribly hurt. ,21100
MARGARET How could anyone... say something so cruel? 83. ,181000
WALTER (a seething fury) What do YOU care?! That's MY name being dragged through the mud! Walter CRUSHES the newspaper. ,15600
He spins on the guy. ,1760000
WALTER Is he here? ,8420000
SOCIETY MAN Er... yes. ,4310000
Which is perhaps why it would be best for everybody if you -- Walter STORMS out. ,56600
The guy futilely chases -- INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME Walter barrels in. ,5890
The ROOMFUL OF GUESTS are all staring. ,12300
WALTER WHO WROTE THIS SHIT? People cower. ,18500
Walter scans the crowd... and spots a cluster. ,52400
Ah-hah! There is Canaday. ,263000
Possessed, Walter strides over. ,12700
Canaday stares, defiant. ,50100
It's tense -- until he clears his throat. ,3720000
CANADAY Mr. Keane, this is not the venue. ,937000
Perhaps you'd like to write a letter to the editor. ,28900000
Walter's throat tightens. ,2460
He steps right into the guy's face. ,4040000
Women GASP. Tension bristles -- like a fight's about to erupt. ,12300
WALTER What are you afraid of?? (MALEVOLENT) Just because people like my work, that means it's automatically bad?? ,7800
CANADAY No. But that doesn't make it art either. ,50800000
Walter shudders. ,37
Canaday asserts himself. ,761000
CANADAY Art should elevate -- not pander! Particularly in a Hall of Education! WALTER (OFFENDED) You have no idea! (MORE) 84. ,4960
WALTER (CONT'D) Why does a man become a critic --?? ,2360000
Because he can't create! You don't -- CANADAY Ugh! That moldy chestnut -- WALTER Don't interrupt! You don't know what it's like! To put your emotions out there, naked, for the world to see. ,6560
CANADAY What emotions?! It's synthetic hack work! (he loses it) Your "masterpiece" has an infinity of Keanes -- which just makes it an infinity of kitsch! Crazed, Walter grabs a FORK off the buffet. ,4
He lunges, like he's about to STAB Canaday! WIDE Women SCREAM. A few MUSCULAR MEN start to break through, to help. ,7630
WALTER looks around -- then quivers, realizing he's out of control. ,128000
Shamed, he slowly drops the fork. ,64200
People breathe a sigh of relief. ,459000
MARGARET is mortified. ,29000
This is all too awful. ,173000
Silent, she watches Walter back out of the party... ,806000
CUT TO: INT. WORLD'S FAIR HALL OF EDUCATION - DAY "Tomorrow Forever" gets TAKEN DOWN. Burly WORKMEN slide the painting into a huge WOODEN BOX. INT. KEANE HOUSE - NIGHT The house is dark. ,617
Walter is raging, in an alcoholic fury. 85. ,133000
WALTER What's wrong with lowest common denominators?! That's what this country was built on!! He KNOCKS over a lamp. ,1630
Crash! WALTER I'm gonna sue EVERYBODY! I'll sue that pansy critic! And the World's Fair! And -- Unicef! (CRAZED) Yeah! I'll take down Unicef, and all their precious little boxes of dimes! Walter RUSHES BY. In a dim alcove, we make out Margaret and Jane, huddled in the shadows. ,1
Jane looks up at her mother with wide, frightened eyes. ,594000
Suddenly -- Walter LUNGES at them! They SCREAM, startled. ,13300
WALTER But I can't sue you, can I? (in Margaret's face) You were the ultimate betrayal! You FAILED me with that painting! Suddenly, he pulls out a BOOK OF MATCHES. He lights a MATCH and waves it sinisterly -- WALTER You crossed over from sentimentality to KITSCH! He THROWS the match at them. ,704
JANE Ow! MARGARET STOP IT! He lights ANOTHER MATCH. WALTER You like making me look bad?? ,205000
You enjoy people laughing at me??! He PUNCHES the wall, then tosses the match. ,31300
Fwoosh! MARGARET Walter! He throws ANOTHER MATCH. 86. ,306000
WIDE Margaret grabs Jane and starts running. ,263000
They rush into the blackness. ,30700000
Walter squints woozily, then starts to CHASE -- INT. HALLWAY The ladies run for their lives. ,638
Violent THUDS behind them! Something SMASHES. Margaret reaches the Painting Room. ,302000
She YANKS Jane inside, then SLAMS the door! Walter staggers up. ,13800
WALTER LET ME IN! INSIDE THE PAINTING ROOM Margaret LOCKS the door. ,486000
She backs away. ,3250000
INT. HALLWAY Walter tugs the door. ,28200
He POUNDS it, crazed. ,7780000
WALTER Lemme in, you BITCHES!! INSIDE THE PAINTING ROOM Margaret and Jane shudder. ,12300
All around them, Big Eyes stare down from above. ,349000
INT. HALLWAY In his haze, Walter remembers the hidden key. ,45600
Raging, he drunkenly pulls over the chair, then stands on it. ,318000
But he's too wobbly -- and falls. ,22600000
Bam! WALTER Ow! INSIDE THE PAINTING ROOM Margaret hugs Jane. 87. ,52300
JANE Mom, what are we gonna do??! Margaret thinks. ,852000
INT. HALLWAY Walter laughs crazily and lights another MATCH. It flickers. ,5350
WALTER You got all that paint and turpentine in there? ,725000
Well I'm gonna burn you up! He pushes the lit match through the KEYHOLE. WALTER You're gonna blow like an atom bomb! INSIDE THE PAINTING ROOM The match drops on the floor -- then goes out, harmless. ,8
Margaret makes a decision. ,2000000
MARGARET We're leaving. ,59000000
Determined, Margaret runs to the curtained wall. ,12200
She whips it aside -- revealing the sliding glass doors. ,1320000
INT. LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER Walter is lighting another match -- when he spins. ,257000
Through rheumy eyes, HEADLIGHTS orbit across the front window. ,234000
He peers, confused... ,3030000
CUT TO: INT. CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT Margaret and Jane drive fast. ,597000
Adrenaline pumping. ,353000

MARGARET Where we're going, we won't need much. (LONG PAUSE) Hawaii. ,798000
Jane freezes, not sure whether to believe. ,4320000

MARGARET Yes, Hawaii. ,2670000
Because it's paradise. ,3640
There's flowers, and birds, and beautiful colors. (GENTLE) And... we're going to make a new life for ourselves. ,280000
DISSOLVE TO: EXT. HAWAIIAN HOUSE - DAY Hawaii, paradise indeed. ,189000
A dense, tropical forest of deep greens and giant blooming flowers. ,48700
Margaret stands on the porch of her small, lovely house, breathing in the clean air. ,14300
She looks lightened. ,2540000
In a clearing, Jane plays with some LOCAL TEENS. INT. HAWAIIAN HOUSE - SAME TIME The house is simple. ,188000
In one light-filled corner is an EASEL. Margaret is painting Nature: Splaying ferns. ,316000
Wild succulents. ,3150
In the window, a BIRD flies by, its plumage a dazzling red. ,27700
Margaret thinks -- then takes out a tube of RED PAINT. She starts to apply the vivid color onto her canvas... ,49300
When -- a RINGING PHONE. Margaret reacts, startled. ,62000
This is unexpected. ,10500000
And unsettling. ,267000
It RINGS. RINGS. RINGS. Finally, she hurries to her one telephone, mounted on the kitchen wall. ,19600
She slowly answers it. ,3000000
MARGARET Hello? ,4560
WALTER (O.S.) Maggie --? ,681000
She freezes. ,54500
INTERCUT: 89. ,66300
WALTER ON THE PHONE - WOODSIDE He is strangely controlled and forboding. ,8360000
WALTER Boy, you were sure hard to track down. ,800000
Thought I might never find you... (a menacing chuckle) I'm a little agitated. ,12200
I got the strangest papers in the mail today. ,35600
Margaret tries to stay cool. ,944000
MARGARET It's a decree of legal separation. ,214000
I would appreciate if you signed it. ,2220000
WALTER Aren't you acting too rash? ,3360000
MARGARET Walter, our marriage is over. ,2180000
WALTER Granted, our romance may have seen its better days. ,165000
The bloom is off the rose. (BEAT) But I'm looking out for both of us. ,4630000
What about Keane Incorporated?! We're a professional couple. ,1510000
Like Roy Rogers and Dale Evans. ,2110000
MARGARET Walter, I want a divorce. ,936000
WALTER Whew. ,31
It hurts to hear you say those words. ,1190000
He is feigning "hurt feelings." Struggling for a response. ,494000
Finally, his thoughts sharpen up, smart and shrewd. ,79000
WALTER I sure hate that it's come to this. (BEAT) Well... ,2290000
I SUPPOSE I can agree to a split -- as long... as you assign me all rights to every painting ever produced. ,37600
MARGARET If that's the price. ,556000000
WALTER Really?! 90. ,4790000
Walter is surprised. ,12500000
Greedy, calculating, he wonders if he can push her further... ,272000
WALTER Uh -- okay. ,718000
And... then, we have to consider future revenue stream. ,19400000
MARGARET My God, Walter! How much more money do you need? ,1710000
WALTER It's -- the marketplace! I gotta stay fresh. ,1600000
Surely you understand? (DEADLY) You want me out of your life, here's my term: You'll have to paint me 100 more waifs. 100 more Walter Keanes! Margaret's face drops, pained. ,739
But she doesn't object. ,2090000
CUT TO: EXT. HAWAIIAN HOUSE - DAY Margaret loads BUNDLED, WRAPPED PAINTINGS into a dusty pickup truck. ,27100
Jane comes running by, barefoot. ,277000
MARGARET Would you like to go into town? ,68200000
I'm stopping by the post office. ,5460000
JANE No, I'm gonna surf with the gang. ,944000
Margaret tightens up. ,24000
MARGARET Your friends are a bit... wild. ,1310000
JANE (SHE SNAPS) Loosen up, Mom! You're impossible! You move me all the way to Hawaii. ,20500
Then I actually make some friends, and all you do is complain about them. (CUTTING) Maybe you need to make some. ,440000
MARGARET Y-you know I can't have people over to the house. ,2800000
JANE That's right! Or they'd see the precious paintings!! 91. ,1290000
Margaret has no response. ,1850000
Jane runs off. ,16400000
INT. HAWAIIAN HOUSE - DAY Margaret is alone, pouring a drink. ,44400
She mixes in some ice -- then sees something odd. ,60200
OUTSIDE THE WINDOW Coming down the long driveway are two FIGURES. Two small WOMEN, patiently walking toward the isolated house. ,14500
Margaret stares, puzzled. ,62200
The women come closer. ,81700000
They are Asian, dressed in formal dresses. ,799000
Curious, Margaret creeps over, spying on them... ,116000
They walk up and ring the bell. ,23900000
DING-DONG! An unsure beat... then Margaret opens the door. ,140000
The ladies smile politely. ,58900
ASIAN LADY #1 Hello. ,11200000
We're visiting everyone in this neighborhood with an important message. ,1520000
No doubt you're busy, so we'll be brief. ,870000
Margaret stares at them deadpan, highball in her hand. ,12500
ASIAN LADY #2 We have something to share with you about the wonderful things that God's Kingdom will do for mankind. ,11200000
MARGARET I'm not interested. ,1460000
She starts to close the door... but they continue. ,395000
ASIAN LADY #1 Do you mean that you are not interested in the Bible, or in religion in general? ,13800000
MARGARET I'm not interested in whatever you're selling. ,981000
The lady glances at Margaret's glass. ,12100
She smiles gently. ,2820000
ASIAN LADY #2 But we're not selling anything. ,13800000
We're just here to share the good news. 92. ,51600000
MARGARET (DOUR) From where I'm standing, I don't see much good anywhere. ,1090000
Just a lot of pride, and thievery, and people treating each other poorly. ,1300000
ASIAN LADY #2 Yes! Exactly! That is the good news! What? ,13800000
Margaret is lost. ,18500000
The ladies grab the opening. ,3860000
ASIAN LADY #1 Bad things in the world are a sign. ,13800000
They show us that earthly Paradise is at hand. ,93200
ASIAN LADY #2 Do you know what it says in Timothy 3:1-5? (she pulls out a BIBLE and quickly thumbs to a page) "In the last days, critical times hard to deal with will be here. ,13800000
For men will be lovers of themselves. ,5440000
Lovers of money. ,12100000
Self-assuming, haughty, blasphemers, disobedient --" MARGARET Sounds like my ex-husband. ,63500
Margaret laughs. ,1720
Surprised, the women laugh, too. ,6100000
Margaret peers at them. ,641000
At their Bible. ,12800000
MARGARET Would you like to come in? ,99900000
CUT TO: LATER The three women sit. ,11000000
Margaret gazes... ,280
MARGARET It's been so long since I've been happy. ,355000
But, I don't even know why I'm telling you... two complete strangers. ,544000
ASIAN LADY #1 It's our mission to comfort those in mourning. ,11200000
Jehovah wants us to help the brokenhearted. ,366000
MARGARET So you're -- Jehovah's Witnesses? 93. ,496000
The ladies nod. ,710
Margaret thinks. ,3740
MARGARET I've explored so many religions. ,896000
But they all had their flaws... ,2960000
ASIAN LADY #2 Then they're wrong for you. ,13800000
Read your Bible -- you might be surprised by the answers it gives. (GENTLE) Margaret, you can't go down a path unless you know, in your heart, it's the right one. ,28
MARGARET And how do you know...? ,53500000
ASIAN LADY #2 (SHE SMILES) Because our beliefs are supported by the Scriptures. ,13800000
Jehovah is the God of truth. ,15
Margaret glances over at a half-completed "Keane" on the easel. ,12500
A strange pause. ,1190000
MARGARET What does that mean, exactly? ,3390000
ASIAN LADY #2 (EMPHATIC) Honesty leads to self-respect. ,13800000
A feeling of well-being. ,987000
Margaret is piqued. ,17300
Her eyes widen. ,55200
Like a Keane. ,55
CUT TO: INT. HAWAIIAN HOUSE - NIGHT Margaret is enthralled, avidly perusing a happy-looking booklet, "The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life." MARGARET It says here a worshiper of Jehovah must be honest in all things. ,38
Jane snorts. ,4500
JANE I just can't believe you let people in the house. 94. ,245000
MARGARET I have nothing to hide! (TORRID) It also says no lies. "Speak truth. ,14300000
Let the stealer steal no more." Margaret and Jane lock eyes. ,275000
CUT TO: INT. WOODSIDE HOUSE - DAY Loud JAZZ plays. ,43300
Back home, Walter is living a Man's, Man's World. ,75000000
He's partying, drinking and dancing with two cute HIPPIE CHICKS in bikinis. ,59000
The place is like a WAREHOUSE, Keane PRINTS stacked everywhere. ,1500000
HIPPIE CHICK Shit, this is crazy! All these copies... you're like Warhol! WALTER Nah, Warhol's like me. ,12500
That fruitfly stole my act! "The Factory"? ,240000
I had a factory before he had a soup can! The girls scrunch their faces, lost. ,377000
Then -- DING-DONG! Walter peeks out the window, then grins. ,38800
WALTER Ah! It's my art supplies. ,28300000
INT. PAINTING ROOM - SECONDS LATER Alone, Walter eagerly pries open a GIANT CRATE. He pulls out padding. ,744
Wadded Honolulu newspapers. ,12400000
Then... a PAINTING. Ah! A new WAIF, surrounded by colorful tropical plants. ,188000
Walter smiles triumphantly -- until -- his happiness melts into confusion. ,16800
Then horror. ,3410000
We ZOOM INTO the painting's SIGNATURE. It says "MDH Keane." Walter freaks. ,3830
WALTER AAAGGGGHH! CUT TO: INT. HAWAIIAN KINGDOM HALL - DAY The JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES sing a joyous, high-spirited PSALM: 95. ,15
JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES "Tremble not before your foe, Let all lovers of truth know! That my reigning Son, Christ Jesus, From the heav'ns has cast the foe. ,3360
Soon will bind the Devil, Satan, Letting all his victims go!" Margaret and Jane are singing happily. ,55300
INT. HAWAIIAN HOUSE - DAY Margaret pours her liquor down the sink. ,329000
Margaret tosses her cigarettes in the trash. ,3440000
Margaret swells, feeling a burst of power. ,12200
Then a VOICE: D.J. (O.S.) Oh yeah! We got a special guest today. ,51000000
A world-famous celebrity who just called up and asked to come in..! INT. RADIO BOOTH - DAY Angle on BIG LOLO, a gregarious Hawaiian D.J. in headphones. ,6170
D.J. ,21000000
She's malihini! Moved to the islands a couple months ago... so let's give a big aloha to Margaret Keane! He pops in a cart. ,789
Canned APPLAUSE plays. ,656000
We reveal across from him... ,8600000
He grins. ,76300
D.J. ,21000000
So is it true your husband Walter is the top-selling painter in the world? ,1740000
We SLOWLY PUSH IN to her. ,2390
Tentative, she speaks. ,1070000
MARGARET No... ,20800
Big Lolo. ,5760
Everything you just said is false. ,85500
Margaret takes a deep breath. ,84800
Working up her courage. ,3970000
MARGARET One: Walter is no longer my husband. (a long pause) And Two: He's not... a painter. ,36700
Margaret exhales. ,17
The D.J. is confused. ,198000000
He checks his notes. 96. ,1600000
D.J. ,20900000
But, am I... mixed-up? ,18100000
Ain't he the guy who does the crazy eyes? ,2450000
MARGARET No. Though he's been taking credit for ten years. (STRONG) I'm the only painter in the family. ,61800
Margaret slowly smiles. ,691000
And then... a calmness comes over her. ,72100
Like a cloud has lifted. ,813000
INT. RADIO STATION HALLWAY - DAY Margaret and Jane walk away. ,396000
Jane beams proudly, then gives her mother a warm hug. ,85300

CANADAY You have got to be kidding! INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - DAY TIGHT - The San Francisco Examiner. ,388000

He whirls and looks around. ,8040000
Paranoia ratcheting. ,22
Is everybody staring at him? ,616000
Walter starts shaking in horror. ,603000
Then -- he jumps and BOLTS OUT. INT. BAR - NIGHT Walter sits with Dick. ,32400
Walter's desperate, sweaty. ,260000
WALTER Margaret's gone berserk! You gotta help me! I need a story, a wire story -- national! -- to calm things down. ,97200
Dick peers shrewdly. ,501000
DICK I don't know... ,8550000
What she has said is pretty inflammatory. ,61700
WALTER But it's nuts! It doesn't even make sense. ,1490000
When I was studying art at the Beaux Arts in Paris, she was still a kid in Tennessee! Dick reacts. ,34100
Walter whips out the "Tomorrow's Master's" BOOK. WALTER Look! These are my early sketches. (he flips pages, like a MAGICIAN) See?! Berlin orphans, 1946! DICK (PIQUED) But... how could she... ,1310
WALTER Exactly! It's impossible! We didn't meet for another nine years! After she busted her first marriage. (HE SHRUGS) Hell, she busted OUR marriage! Sleeping around with whatever trash she could find!! Dick's head is spinning. 98. ,31400
DICK I-I, but... why would Maggie do this? ,2510000
WALTER She's unhinged! She left me and moved into the jungle. ,312000
She fell in with a bunch of religious zealots: (WHISPERING) Jehovah's Witnesses. ,35500
DICK I really don't know much about them... ,13700000
WALTER Oh! These people are gone! Solid gone! They don't celebrate Christmas, they can't salute the flag... they won't even let Janie go to the prom! Dick is startled. ,20
INT. HAWAIIAN HOUSE - DAY Margaret sits with a GROUP of her Witness friends. ,14200
She is sorrowful. ,1210000
Clutching ASSORTED NEWSPAPERS. MARGARET He made me sound crazy!! ASIAN LADY #2 Just rise above it. ,15200000
MARGARET But how can I?! He claims I copied HIM! That he taught ME how to paint! (reading the NEWSPAPER) "She used a slide projector to trace my work and fill in the colors." ASIAN LADY #1 And which part of that is untrue? ,51400
MARGARET ALL OF IT! (IMPASSIONED) When I finally told the truth, I felt good about myself for the first time in years!! I'm not going to let him take that away. ,295000
Nobody is sure what to say. ,17700000
Until -- Jane pipes up: JANE Hey. ,1220000
Is Jehovah okay with suing?? ,163000
EXT. HONOLULU FEDERAL COURTHOUSE - DAY The mighty courtroom steps are SWARMING WITH PEOPLE. It's a circus. ,15700
LOCAL TV NEWS CREWS do standups: REPORTER #1 Seventeen million dollars! (BEAT) The art world is abuzz! Is it possible that the decade's top-selling painter can't even paint??! REPORTER #2 Or is Mrs. ,51
Keane simply a bitter ex- wife, trying to steal her husband's fame and fortune? (BEAT) Today in Federal Court, lawyers present their opening arguments in the case of Margaret Keane vs. ,40800
Walter Keane and Gannett Newspapers. ,10200
A trial that could produce the largest libel and slander award in Hawaiian history. ,22
Margaret, Jane, Margaret's LAWYER, and her FRIENDS walk up. ,244000
Margaret glances over -- and spots FEMINIST SUPPORTERS smiling at her. ,20900
They hold up signs: "Stand Up and Be Counted!" Margaret is bewildered. ,11400
She hurries in. ,150000
AT THE CURB Walter and a POSSE OF LAWYERS exit a towncar. ,15300
The REPORTERS charge over, as Walter puts on a confident face. ,297000
REPORTER #1 Mr. Keane! Are you at all concerned about the charges? ,21800000
WALTER I'm angry as hell! But I'm lucky to have the mighty Gannett News Company watching my back. ,895000
I expect to have this whole trial dismissed by noon. (BEAT) Truthfully, my only concern is that somebody get this woman some psychiatric care. ,19000
She needs it! CUT TO: INT. FEDERAL COURTROOM - LATER The EIGHT JURORS watch attentively. ,11600
Walter sits with the table of slick Gannett lawyers. ,26000
The lead lawyer stands in front of the irritable Chinese JUDGE. 100. ,123000
GANNETT LAWYER Margaret Keane is a public figure. ,56300
And as such, she has to prove that our newspapers published statements, aware of probable falsity. (BEAT) But there is no evidence that our editors could have known that the assertions were untrue. (BEAT) We would like to submit 692 articles and interviews in which Mrs. ,642
Keane credits Mr. Keane as the painter of the so-called "big eye" children. ,296000
His Associate hands two massive bound PILES OF NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES to the BAILIFF. Margaret winces. ,1820
Walter grins, eating it up. ,42200
The Judge stares sourly at the piles. ,9320
JUDGE How many years back do these go? ,33500000
GANNETT LAWYER Mrs. ,256000
Keane has been making these statements since 1958. ,25100
JUDGE This is a very strange case. ,4340000
These paintings hang in museums all over the world, attributed to Mr. Keane. ,9750
And regardless of the truth, Mrs. ,2250000
Keane has contributed immeasurably to the confusion... ,12200
The Judge stares off... then makes a decision. ,4510000
JUDGE It seems impossible that Gannett's actions would ever meet the legal standard for libel. ,4560
So -- the charge against them is dismissed. ,119000
WIDE The Lawyer smiles, relieved. ,12900
GANNETT LAWYER Thank you, Your Honor! 101. ,639000
Walter peers, comprehending... and then, a realization slowly kicks in. ,14000
His face turns to horror. ,638000
The Lawyer nods humbly, then spins away. ,77700
GANNETT LAWYER Good luck, Keane. ,157000
AT THE DEFENSE TABLE The ENTIRE LEGAL TEAM jumps up and begins packing their briefcases. ,48200
Walter sputters in astonishment. ,13000
WALTER "Good luck"? ,1320000
W-where the hell are you going?! GANNETT LAWYER We were charged with libel. ,3140000
You're charged with slander. (BLASE) Just dance your way out of it. ,16400
The Lawyers file out, leaving Walter alone at the table. ,48100
He looks very small and pale. ,165000
The Judge peers quizzically. ,1100000
JUDGE Mr. Keane, you appear to be without counsel. ,1730000
Would you like a postponement, in order to get your affairs in order? ,8800000
Walter glances over at Margaret. ,21200
She stifles a laugh. ,120000
He glares daggers. ,16700
Then, cocksure, foolhardy, he jumps to his feet. ,1010000
WALTER I've always taken care of myself, Your Honor. ,27800
And I don't need a bunch of rent-a-suits to defend my good name! (BEAT) Let's PROCEED! CUT TO: INSERT - WIRE SERVICE TELETYPE MACHINE Words type out: "AP - HONOLULU - KEANE TRIAL TAKES STARTLING TURN" 102. ,2550
INSERT - ANOTHER WIRE SERVICE MACHINE More words type out: "UPI - HONOLULU - HE'S A PAINTER... ,127000
AND A LAWYER?" INT. DICK NOLAN'S OFFICE - DAY Dick frantically types at his typewriter. ,322000
DICK (V.O.) I'm concerned about my old pal Walter Keane. ,275000
The Hawaiian heat may have cooked his brain! The only thing he knows about courtrooms and lawyers comes from watching Perry Mason on television! CUT TO: INT. COURTROOM - LATER Walter stands down front. ,4
Like a Broadway star, center-stage. ,245000
WALTER I'm the sole creator of my art. ,1290000
This is my total life. ,589000
My contribution to the world -- JUDGE Mr. KEANE! I've told you, you must ask the witness questions! If you're acting as your own attorney, you cannot make statements at this time. ,29300
WALTER Oh. Right! Ah, sorry, Your Honor. (BEAT) It's hard to keep this all straight... ,65100
Walter gathers his thoughts -- then turns to the WITNESS STAND. Sitting in it... is Margaret. ,45500
WALTER Mrs. ,8210
It seems impossible that you'd expect anybody to swallow your fantastic story -- JUDGE MR. KEANE!! Walter grimaces. ,5810
He tries again, choosing his words. ,3940000
WALTER Mrs. ,28300
You seem like a lucid woman. ,70600
Reasonably intelligent... ,41000
So how could you possibly have gone along with such a far-out scheme? 103. ,1340000
We slowly MOVE IN ON MARGARET. This is her moment. ,62800
And then -- quietly, she speaks. ,501000
MARGARET I was forced into it. ,1120000
You had -- She stops, bothered by this awkwardness. ,74000000
She looks away from Walter, to the Jury instead. ,1410000
MARGARET He had me dominated. ,1760000
He would rant and rave if I didn't do what he wanted. ,473000
I was afraid. ,1480000
I didn't see any option, so I went along. ,57400000
I felt very bad... ,268000
WALTER (like a TV lawyer) I want to remind you you are under oath. ,205000
The Judge SLAMS his fists down, enraged. ,128000
Walter jumps. ,1560
WALTER S-sorry. ,173000
Margaret turns back to the Jury. ,674000
MARGARET I just gave in. ,7100000
I allowed him to take credit for the big eyes. ,4770000
They reflected all my feelings... and... it was like losing a child... (SHE SIGHS) I was weak. ,322000
I didn't feel I could leave and support myself and my daughter. ,2510000
He said nobody would buy the paintings without his personality. (SOFT) Maybe he was right... (TO WALTER) You were very talented at being charming. ,40000
You were a genius at salesmanship and promotion. ,16800000
WALTER Hm! It sounds like you've described two different men. ,1270000
One a sadistic ogre... and the other a delightful bon vivant. ,12400
Margaret stares him in the eyes. ,471000
MARGARET That's you, Walter. ,26700000
Jekyll and Hyde. 104. ,1530000
WALTER What an outrageous statement! I demand we strike that from the record! JUDGE (he SLAMS his fist) Overruled!! MARGARET (she loses her temper) No! You're outrageous! Constantly criticizing! Wearing me down! Saying I'd be "knocked off" if I ever told the truth!! The Jury GASPS. Walter throws out his hands. ,2210
WALTER Your HONOR! I ask for a mistrial! Both Keanes starts QUARRELING. The Judge STANDS. JUDGE HEY! This is not a domestic squabble! Or -- maybe it is. ,6
But the rest of us have no interest in watching you two go at it. ,73700
Walter calms himself, contrite. ,9350000
WALTER I'm sorry for the emotions. ,1470000
The Judge stares harshly. ,235000
JUDGE Maybe. ,341000
IN THE BACK OF THE COURTROOM Two SKETCH ARTISTS are busy, drawing the trial. ,238000
One guy pokes the other one, to show off his work. ,190000
His SKETCH is a typical courtroom drawing, except everyone is drawn with big ridiculous Keane eyes. ,5720
The second guy GIGGLES. His buddy grins, then quickly erases the silly eyes before anyone sees it. ,3620
CUT TO: INT. COURTROOM - LATER Margaret is back at the litigant's table, with her lawyer. 105. ,2770
Walter stands, at his table. ,1540000
He shouts out. ,170000
WALTER I call as my witness... ,7380000
Mr. Walter Stanley Keane! A strange beat. ,2720
The Jurors glance at each other. ,15100
Walter reacts, like he just heard his name. ,1560000
He strides jauntily over to the witness stand. ,70200
The BAILIFF gives the Judge a weird look. ,63800
Then, he pulls out a Bible. ,2640000
Walter slaps down his hand. ,44900
BAILIFF Do you swear to the tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? ,265000
WALTER YESSS! Walter bounces out, a bit manic. ,76000
He runs back to his lawyer table, then spins to address the empty witness stand. ,27000
WALTER Mr. Keane. ,213000
There has been a lot of innuendo and contradictory testimony about the genesis of the "big-eyed waifs." Would you mind clarifying to this court, once and for all, who spawned these paintings? ,1170
Walter sprints back into the witness stand. ,398000
He sits, then reacts coyly, as if he's surprised. ,27700
WALTER Why -- I created the children. ,1980000
Walter starts to stand again -- but the Judge SLAMS his bench. ,202000
JUDGE The choreography is not necessary. ,326000
Just sit down and testify. ,1930000
Oh. Walter sits, then gathers his thoughts... ,33600
We slowly PUSH IN. He smiles, wistfully... ,2250000
WALTER I've had a wonderful life. ,92300
I've been an artist, a world traveler, a friend of untold celebrities... (he gets misty-eyed) But when I look back at it all, when I peer into my heart and define what mattered... (MORE) 106. ,255
WALTER (CONT'D) it is that I was dedicated to the hungry children of the world. (GENUINE) It all began in Berlin. ,1030
After World War II... ,2550000
DISSOLVE TO: LATER WALTER ...the orphans were clutching the barbed wire. ,12200
Their bodies lacerated, their fingers scrawny, their eyes big and helpless. ,25900
Imploring me, begging me... "Do something!" (HUSHED) "Do something." DISSOLVE TO: LATER WALTER ...and then Miss Joan Crawford walked up to me... ,8150
LATER WALTER ...Kim Novak... ,241000
LATER WALTER ...Liberace... ,215000
LATER WALTER ...Wayne Newton... ,46900
LATER WALTER Miss Natalie Wood walked up and said, "That is the greatest single painting I have ever seen in my entire life." The Judge is bored out of his mind. ,1240
LATER WALTER I was born in a small town. ,1360000
My father made upholstery for the automobile INDUSTRY -- 107. ,1770000
JUDGE You're done. ,152000
Walter stops, surprised. ,1050000
WALTER B-but, I'm not finished -- JUDGE Actually, you are! (he blows his stack) I cannot stomach one more wild tangent or shaggy dog tale. ,6080
You're not testifying -- you're filibustering! The Federal Courts are overburdened enough, without your docket-clogging nonsense. (BEAT) We can stay here until we grow old and die... but it's obvious that this case boils down to your word versus Mrs. ,91
Keane's word. ,169000000
WALTER (HOPEFUL) So... mistrial? ,41000
JUDGE NO! It's not a mistrial!! In my opinion, there's only one way to clear up this thicket. ,10200
You are both going to paint. ,5
Walter gasps, stunned. ,35000
All color drains from his face. ,74900
ANGLE - MARGARET Her face lights up. ,80200000
She slowly breaks into a satisfied smile. ,1530000
CUT TO: INT. COURTROOM - LATER The doors SLAM open. ,394000
The Bailiff leads in a crew of COURT DEPUTIES, all carrying ART SUPPLIES: Easels, brushes, paint... ,3250
BAILIFF Awright, bring those easels down. ,21500
Careful, don't bump anything... watch it with those paint cans, I got some newspaper on the floor down front... ,15400
The Jury is fascinated. ,3450000
Margaret watches, quite eager. ,632000
In the gallery, Jane grins. ,1570000
But Walter is horrified. ,1670000
Trying not to tremble. 108. ,270000
DOWN FRONT The Bailiff directs the deputies, setting up TWO EASELS, back to back. ,79000
On each easel is placed a small square canvas. ,2700000
The Judge addresses the room. ,73800
JUDGE Now, I'm not looking for a masterpiece. ,12300000
I don't know much about these things -- I'm a jurist, not an art critic -- but, is one hour enough? ,320000
Margaret nods: Sure. ,48700
Shaking, Walter barely moves his head. ,30300
JUDGE Okay then. ,14200000
You've both been provided with identical supplies... so -- without any further business... ,54200
Keane, Mr. Keane, the court is yours. ,611000
WIDE Margaret glances at Walter. ,13000
What will he do? ,110000000
Walter's face is grimly blank. ,67400
Margaret proceeds. ,80
Slowly, she pushes her chair from the table and rises. ,635000
Margaret walks over to the closest EASEL, then sits. ,163000
She ties on a smock over her checkered dress. ,113000
THE JURORS crane their necks, intently curious. ,11900
MARGARET takes a pencil. ,454000
She peeks over at Walter -- who's still glued to his seat. ,27500
His face tight, his expression queasy. ,167000
Staring off to some faraway place. ,3170000
Margaret looks up at the CLOCK. 3:20. ,3130000
Totally calm, in a motion she's done so many times, she focuses on the canvas and starts outlining a Waif. ,507
Everybody watches. ,20800
Effortlessly, she pencils the EYES. They are enormous. ,565000
The largest orbs she has ever done. 109. ,169000
WALTER looks ill. ,16100000
Wracked with uncertainty. ,348000
The Judge turns to him. ,4510000
JUDGE Mr. Keane? ,611000
WALTER (FAINT) I'm... setting the mood. (WHISPERING) Getting the... muse to strike... ,96100
JUDGE (BEAT) Well, your muse has 58 minutes. ,183000
MARGARET fills in more detail. ,279000
Ears... nose... then, little fingers clutching a fence. ,853000
The child is peeking over it, staring right at us... ,2690000
WALTER is melting down. ,13600000
In total crisis... ,8550000
THE CLOCK'S second hand sweeps around. ,54400
It's 3:34... ,1380000000
THE JURORS look from Margaret to Walter. ,86000
Why isn't he moving?? ,58100
MARGARET finishes penciling. ,305000
She leans back, satisfied with the composition. ,283000
Then, she reaches for... the PAINT. She unscrews a tube and squirts it on the palette. ,7040
She rests it on her lap and starts mixing a flesh tone... ,21900
THE JUDGE gapes at Walter, befuddled. ,663
WALTER feels all eyes on him. ,312000
He has to do something. ,27
Hesitantly, visibly shaking, he rises from the table. ,119000
Margaret notices this. 110. ,1870000
Walter braces himself, trying to look confident, then takes a step. ,312000
Suddenly -- he SQUEALS. WALTER OW! Walter contorts his face in AGONY. He grabs his shoulder. ,912
JUDGE Mr. Keane! Are you all right? ,1580000
WALTER No -- it's -- (GRIMACING) Ah shoot! My old shoulder injury just flared up. ,4450
I've got a bad muscle -- I've been taking medication for the inflammation... ,1390000
Walter shrugs pathetically -- WALTER I -- I don't think I'll be able to paint today. ,2560000
THE JUDGE is astonished. ,240000
WIDE The courtroom reacts. ,76700
MARGARET peers at Walter, knowingly. ,641000
She's not surprised. ,10000000
This was his only way out. ,65700
She squirts out some white oil paint, then begins painting the eyes. ,429000
WALTER sinks down in his chair, beaten. ,997000
All life gone. ,221000000
He stares at the emerging canvas, eyes wide, and we PUSH INTO WALTER'S FACE. He is witnessing the end of his empire... the destruction of everything that makes him who he is. ,2030
We push in TIGHTER... ,768000
TIGHTER... until the screen fills with his two eyes. 111. ,2500000
Big. ,56300000
Sad. ,16300000
And filling with tears. ,819000
CUT TO: EXT. FEDERAL COURTHOUSE - DAY The doors open, and Margaret comes tumbling out, victorious. ,115000
She has WON! She's surrounded by Jane, her friends, and a MOB OF REPORTERS. They all SHOUT: "Mrs. ,65800
Keane! Margaret! Congratulations!!" MARGARET Thank you! Thank you so much. ,2880000
REPORTER #2 What are you going to call the painting? ,21800000
She smiles, clutching the finished Waif. ,53600
MARGARET "Exhibit 224." They all ROAR with laughter. ,173000
A Reporter does a stand-up: REPORTER #1 The jury found in favor of Margaret Keane on all points. ,5480000
She won on charges of defamation, emotional distress, damaged reputation -- IN THE BACKGROUND Walter drifts out, disheveled and lost. ,7260
He stares hazily... angrily at the crowd. ,203000
WALTER What a group of idiots... a quagmire of incompetence... (RAMBLING) This doesn't change a thing! We slowly PULL AWAY, leaving him tiny in the shot. ,7270
Forgotten. ,15500000
BACK AT MARGARET She hugs Jane. ,1190000
The Reporter jumps in. ,870000
REPORTER #2 Margaret! Do you feel vindicated by the high award? ,21800000
MARGARET Oh... it was never about the money. ,272000
And honestly -- I doubt Walter will even pay. 112. ,822000
The Reporter chuckles. ,826000
Margaret turns serious. ,1330000
MARGARET I just wanted credit for what I had done. ,8720000
The justice is... ,12300000
I got my art back. (SOFT) My prayers have been answered. ,3880000
Margaret takes Jane's hand and starts to walk away. ,2440000
Among the eager fans, a PORTLY LADY steps out, holding a BOOK. She smiles nervously. ,6430
PORTLY LADY Margaret! Could I possibly have your autograph? ,12000
Margaret looks down -- and realizes the book is Walter's volume of "TOMORROW'S MASTERS" Margaret stares at it in wonder, then quickly signs the cover. ,29000
CLOSEUP - MARGARET We hold. ,2270000
She slowly smiles in pride. ,994000
DISSOLVE TO: INT. MARGARET KEANE GALLERY - DAY A brand-new gallery of Margaret's art. ,260000
The walls are covered with NEWLY-PAINTED Waifs and MDH's. ,1270
We GLIDE through the gallery... down the corridors of children and women... ,87200
These paintings of big-eyed children are different. ,3340000
They're in magnificent colorful gardens, surrounded by joyful splashes of red, orange, green... ,2210
CLOSING CARDS: "Walter never accepted defeat, insisting he was the true artist for the rest of his life. ,12200
He died in 2000, bitter and penniless. ,198000
He never produced another painting." "Margaret found personal happiness and remarried. ,761000
After many years in Hawaii, she moved back to San Francisco and opened a new gallery. ,75000
She still paints everyday." We move CLOSER to one child, into the face, until the eyes fill the frame. ,50100
And then... finally, we tilt down. ,760000
Revealing that the child is smiling. ,2320000
INTERSTELLAR Written by Jonathan Nolan STORY BY Jonathan Nolan, Kip Thorne & Lynda Obst MARCH 12 2008 SPACE. But not the dark lonely corner of it we're used to. ,31000
This is a glittering inferno -- the center of a distant galaxy. ,608000
Suddenly, something TEARS past at incredible speed: a NEUTRON STAR. It SMASHES headlong through everything it encounters... planets, stars. ,3330
Can anything stop this juggernaut? ,1180000
Something looms at the heart of the galaxy, hidden inside the blinding starlight, a dark flaw in the fabric of existence itself: a BLACK HOLE. The neutron star is pulled into the black hole's swirl, spiraling closer and closer to destruction. ,846
Finally, it contacts the hole's edge and EXPLODES. The EXPLOSION is so powerful that it sends shock waves into the fabric of space-time itself. ,34800
We ride one of these waves, racing back out from the black hole. ,238000
Suddenly, a portion of the wave disappears down a crystal- like hole, emerging in a much darker region of the universe -- a backwater that, as the wave races past a giant red planet with a distinctive eye, we recognize as our own. ,2450
The wave, now just an infinitesimal ripple, finally reaches our blue planet. ,82000
It drops into our atmosphere over North America, toward the high desert east of the Cascades, and through the roof of a nondescript warehouse. ,975
The wave tickles the atoms in the steel shell of a vacuum chamber, then dances a tiny jig with a laser beam reflected in a heavy piece of glass. ,2560
The wave shoots back out of the building and disappears in the fractal branches of a tumbleweed resting against a concrete tube that stretches for miles in the desert. ,1870
An SUV speeds past the tumbleweed and we follow it till it parks at another plain-looking building at the opposite end of the tube. ,19600
A MAN climbs out of the SUV. INT. CONTROL ROOM, WAREHOUSE -- DAY The man lets himself into a large room that looks like Mission Control. ,695
He pours himself a cup of coffee. ,58300
It is the weekend and the place is empty. ,4320000
No one has been there to see the displays flashing a distinctive shape -- a pulse followed by a series of echoes. ,28100
The man looks up at the screen, then DROPS his cup of coffee. ,4020000
CUT TO: 2. ,436000
INT. LIGO OFFICES, CALTECH, PASADENA -- DAY The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory headquarters at Caltech is a frenzy of activity. ,2790
POSTDOCS and RESEARCHERS huddle around monitors and printouts, arguing. ,2960
ANSEN, 60s, the director of LIGO, walks through the frenzy. ,64000
A postdoc hands him a printout: a pulse followed by echoes. ,22200
INT. LIGO DIRECTOR'S OFFICE, CALTECH -- DAY Ansen steps into the relative calm of a large, sunlit office, which overlooks a grassy stretch of Caltech's campus. ,9
His ASSISTANT, 30s, is on the phone, on hold. ,526000
He looks up at Ansen as he enters. ,31900
ASSISTANT I'm on hold with the INS. (COVERS MICROPHONE) Don't you think we should double check the triangulation before we CALL ANYBODY- ANSEN We have double checked it. ,10100
Someone finally picks up the line. ,2990000
ASSISTANT Yes. ,23500
I'm trying to reach- (pause, listens) No, I don't think you understand how serious this is. (PAUSE) Because if you did, we'd be having this conversation in person. ,40100
He listens for a moment, then hangs up the phone, confused. ,498000
ANSEN What did they say? ,47700000
ASSISTANT They said we should look out the window. ,85200000
Ansen steps to the window and looks out: In the courtyard below, coeds are scrambling to get out of the way as a military helicopter sets down in the middle of the quad and dozens of ARMED FEDERAL AGENTS converge on his building. 3. ,660
INT. MAIN CONFERENCE ROOM, LIGO, CALTECH -- DAY Ansen sits, alone, on one side of a conference table. ,196000
The other side is filled with GOVERNMENT MEN -- NSA mostly, some DIA. The door opens and his assistant steps in. ,69700
Armed guards pat him down, then shove him into a seat. ,119000
ANSEN Is that really necessary? ,479000
One of the NSA agents leans forward. ,530000
NSA AGENT You've been complaining for years that the government doesn't take your project seriously enough, Doctor. (SMILES) You can't have it both ways. ,17800
Ansen motions to his assistant, who turns on a projector. ,12100
On-screen, we see the familiar pulse and echoes. ,2690000
ANSEN Yesterday morning, our facility in Hanford identified this signal: a neutron star colliding with a supermassive black hole. ,1770
We went through the last year's data and triangulated the source. ,4560000
The pulse is translated into a crude animatic of a neutron star circling into the black hole. ,33300
NSA AGENT We know that, Doctor. ,636000
What we don't know is why, according to your numbers, this event took place right here in our own solar system. ,982000
Suddenly, the image overlays the sun, the earth, and the rest of our solar system around the black hole. ,284000
ANSEN It didn't. ,614000
Because if it had we'd all be dead by now. ,10200000
On-screen, Jupiter, then the Earth and the inner planets are consumed by the black hole. ,87700
Only the sun survives, pulled into orbit around its new master. ,58500
ANSEN (CONT'D) Which leaves only one explanation: The signal traveled through a (MORE) 4. ,85100
ANSEN (CONT'D) wormhole. ,8740
A gateway to a distant corner of the universe. ,51300
The black hole is on the far side. ,449000
On-screen, the black hole system is removed to a distant corner, connected to ours by a tunnel through space-time. ,6550
A gravity wave from the collision travels through the tunnel. ,56200
NSA AGENT I've read your book, Doctor. ,9940000
You said that wormholes are impossible. ,51600
ANSEN There is nothing quite as satisfying as being proved utterly wrong. (SMILES) I said that a wormhole couldn't exist naturally. ,9940
Not for more than a few billionths of a second. ,53500000
It would have to be... stabilized. ,1940000
NSA AGENT Stabilized by what? ,1020000
Ansen pauses, unsure. ,51500
His assistant steps in to his defense. ,264000
ASSISTANT We don't have any way to answer that question. ,83300000
NSA AGENT (IGNORES HIM) You're not under peer review here, Doctor. ,34500
I don't care about your reputation. ,23700000
I need to know how that thing got there. ,29200
Ansen finally speaks up. ,106000
ANSEN If you're worried about an invasion, I would start drafting the articles of surrender. (SMILES) Whoever they are, if they can build a wormhole, they could erase us in the blink of an eye. ,6950
Luckily, that also means we have nothing they could be interested in. ,322000
NSA AGENT Then why is it there? 5. ,30600000
ANSEN I don't know. ,9240000
Maybe it's an invitation. ,6650000
A chance to commune with an advanced species. ,758000
The assistant, embarrassed, looks down. ,490000
The agent notices. ,294000
NSA AGENT You don't agree? ,364000
ASSISTANT (DELICATE) No. I don't think we can assume an alien intelligence built the wormhole. (CHANGES TACK) But the opportunity it represents is incredible. ,21500
We could explore parts of the universe we never dreamt of reaching in our lifetimes. ,105000
The agent exchanges a look with one of his colleagues, who steps out of the room. ,321000
ANSEN We need to get back to work. ,80000000
I have a conference call with our European partners in fifteen minutes. ,1740000
NSA AGENT We severed the connections to your European partners this morning. ,163000
ANSEN (INDIGNANT) You can't do that. ,556000000
The Europeans put up some of the funding... ,5930000
GOVERNMENT MAN We'll send them a check. (STANDS) Your project is now classified under the State Secrets Act. ,29600
He steps out the door, leaving the men alone. ,81100
The assistant, outraged, turns back to his boss. ,2320000
ASSISTANT They can't keep this a secret. ,80000000
Sooner or later... ,2070000
The younger man looks down, embarrassed, as he notices that tears are rolling down the older man's cheeks. 6. ,41200
ANSEN I don't care about that. ,1240000
I've spent my whole life being afraid we would wipe ourselves out before this moment arrived. ,15400
We've made so many mistakes, I wasn't sure we'd make it... ,892000
The assitant realizes that the old man is weeping for joy. ,175000
Relief. ,18500000
ANSEN (CONT'D) But this will change everything. ,5550
Fifty years from now, nothing will be the same. ,1930000
The older man looks at the simulation on the screen of the tiny link between our galaxy and another. ,67400
FADE TO BLACK EXT. CORNFIELD, CENTRAL CALIFORNIA -- DAY Corn. ,127000
As far as the eye can see. ,1690000
SUPER TITLE: "FIFTY YEARS LATER" A large old diesel tour bus is parked by the side of a dirt road, smoke pouring out of its open hood. ,727
A dozen MEN in BASEBALL UNIFORMS are standing around the front of the bus. ,136000
A battered PICKUP pulls up, and a MAN, 30s, gets out, leaving his two SONS in the car. ,22100
This is COOPER. He joins the ballplayers staring at the lifeless diesel engine. ,8220
BALLPLAYER Seized up on us. ,12400
COOPER Long way to come by bus. ,58200000
I thought you guys would have a plane. ,140000
BALLPLAYER We did. ,100000000
Ran out of parts for it. ,108000
You know anything about diesels? ,802000
COOPER A little. ,16800000
Cooper steps to the engine compartment. ,195000
The ballplayer notices Cooper's two boys, TOM, 15, and MURPH, 10, watching them. ,1230
He wanders over. 7. ,1030000
BALLPLAYER You think your dad's going to be able to help us out? ,1420000
Murph, a filth-encrusted kid with a black eye, smiles at the ballplayer. ,37
MURPH My dad can fix anything. (WRY SMILE) Except maybe your fastball. ,6010
The ballplayer frowns: smartass kid. ,1910
After a moment under the hood, Cooper signals to the driver, who tries the engine. ,14000
It turns over once, then STARTS. BALLPLAYER Sure appreciate the help. ,1620000
COOPER (SHRUGS) You don't make it, my boys won't get to see you lose. ,179000
The ballplayers load up into the bus and as it pulls away, we can see the logo painted across the back of the bus for the first time: WORLD FAMOUS NEW YORK YANKEES EXT. SPACE, NEAR EARTH ORBIT Earth spins, lazily. ,80
From this height, it looks much the same as it has done for thousands of years. ,78300000
Suddenly, a tiny black object appears, racing toward Earth. ,43300
The object SMASHES into a large satellite and races onward. ,148000
Behind it, the satellite spins out of orbit in a cloud of fragments. ,36600
EXT. BASEBALL STADIUM -- NIGHT An old minor league stadium. ,1060000
The stands are barely halfway full. ,103000
Cooper, his boys, and Cooper's father-in-law, DONALD, 60s, have a row to themselves behind the dugout. ,956
Murph offers his grandpa some popcorn. ,33400
DONALD Popcorn at a ball game is unnatural. ,12300
I want a hot dog. 8. ,4180000
MURPH (CONFUSED) What's a hot dog? ,1360000
Suddenly, play stops on the field below as the players and fans look up at the night sky: A bright blue streak is tearing across it. ,12300
TOM Is that a comet, Dad? ,1270000
COOPER (shakes his head) Satellite. ,139000
Big one. ,6860000
Probably Chinese. ,31600
Everyone watches the fireworks as the satellite burns up in the upper atmosphere. ,95600
After a moment, play resumes -- it's a pretty show, but everyone has seen it plenty of times before. ,57900
Down on the field, the Dodgers' catcher misses an easy pop fly and the Yankees load the bases. ,3440000
Donald looks disgusted. ,670000
INT. COOPER'S TRUCK -- NIGHT Cooper guides his truck along a potholed road. ,143000
His father- in-law is riding shotgun; the boys are sleeping in the back. ,3
DONALD Those clowns would get their asses handed to them by the ballplayers I grew up watching. ,23700
COOPER You ruin it for the boys when you talk like that. ,2340000
DONALD I'm not doing my grandkids any favors by lying to them. ,1080000
They're growing up watching lousy baseball. ,2060000
COOPER They didn't have any baseball at all when I was a kid. ,5260000
That shuts the old man up for now. ,511000
They drive on in silence. ,2380000
CUT TO: 9. ,153000
EXT. FARMHOUSE -- MORNING The sun is gently landing on the horizon, painting the sea of corn around Cooper's modest house gold. ,17600
Cooper walks out of his house, still eating his breakfast. ,145000
Donald is on the porch, looking at a black clouds of smoke in the distance. ,52200
The neighboring fields are BURNING. DONALD Nelson's burning up his crops. ,10300
Found some of the blight on the okra. ,68400
Cooper watches the men walking through the fields, setting fire to the crop. ,208000
COOPER I thought okra wasn't susceptible. ,13000
DONALD (SHRUGS) Better safe than sorry. (looks at him) You've got to take the boys to school. ,968000
COOPER Something wrong with your truck? ,2000000
DONALD (SMILES) Parent-teacher conference day. ,5220000
Cooper bends his head in dismay. ,73400
DONALD (CONT'D) Be nice to Murph's teacher. ,21900
She's single, you know. ,1870000
COOPER What does that have to do with anything? ,45000000
DONALD We're supposed to be repopulating the earth. ,1220000
Gotta pull your weight. ,519000
Besides, the boys could do with a woman in their lives. ,51400000
The boys run out of the house and pile into the truck. ,3140000
Cooper pulls away before Donald can continue. ,64100
EXT. ROAD -- DAY Cooper weaves the car along a dirt road. ,198000
The kids are arguing over an ancient comic book in the back seat. 10. ,147000
Cooper turns around to break it up. ,57800
BANG -- one of the tires blows out in a foot-deep pothole. ,24100
EXT. ROADSIDE -- DAY Cooper examines the flattened tire. ,9240
Looks at his older son. ,151000
COOPER Get the spare, Tom. ,15300000
TOM That is the spare. ,2420000
COOPER All right. ,720000
We'll use the patch kit. ,6390000
He moves to the back of the truck. ,58100
Murph suddenly looks very glum. ,17800
MURPH I... ,15200000
I think the patch kit might not be there... (off his look) Because I was using it for my bike. ,779000
Cooper looks down at the dirt. ,2670000
Sighs. ,16200000
COOPER Murph's law. ,210000
MURPH (CONFUSED) What's that? ,16700000
Tom snorts with laughter. ,37400
Turns to his dad. ,44
TOM The kid doesn't even know what he was named after... ,18200000
Cooper shoots Tom a look -- enough. ,338000
TOM (CONT'D) Murph's law means what can go wrong will go wrong. ,125000
Murph, looking hurt, walks off. ,1350
Cooper turns to his son. ,1990000
COOPER Find something to patch it with. ,1330000
TOM How am I supposed to do that? 11. ,50600000
COOPER Figure it out. ,88300
I'm not always going to be here to help you. ,1470000
Cooper leaves Tom to catch up with his younger son, who is looking out over the river. ,1700000
MURPH Is that really why I'm named Murph, dad? ,384000
COOPER Listen to me. ,7490000
Murph's law doesn't mean that. ,357000
It means what can happen will happen. ,1360000
All kinds of things. ,56600000
Good or bad. ,7490000
And that's the way you want it to be. ,73000000
MURPH Why? ,23900
COOPER Because if nothing ever happened to you then you wouldn't learn anything. ,2860000
Murph is staring off into the distance. ,2090000
He's heard something. ,37700
COOPER (CONT'D) Murph? ,4920
Then Cooper hears it, too. ,303000
A LOW RUMBLING SOUND. Cooper looks out over the river. ,8170000
Then he turns back and tackles his son to the ground. ,11600000
Suddenly, a MASSIVE AIRPLANE SOARS overhead, so close they can almost touch it. ,26500
It bounces the truck on its suspension, then soars off over the fields behind them. ,115000
Cooper grabs Murph and races back to the truck. ,27500
He pulls a laptop and an antenna made out of a Pringles can out of the back of the truck. ,14500
He hands the laptop and antenna to Murph. ,128000
COOPER (CONT'D) Get in. ,374000
Tom is still standing by the side of the road, wrestling with the jack. ,388000
TOM What about the tire? ,10300000
INT. TRUCK -- MOMENTS LATER The truck is SMASHING through the cornfields as fast as Cooper can push it on three good tires. 12. ,1220
Murph is hurriedly firing up the laptop and connecting it to the directional antenna. ,2000
Cooper is straining to see through the cornstalks, scanning the horizon. ,12300
TOM OVER THERE- To the right, the dark shape of the Russian drone appears, flying low over the fields. ,200000
Cooper jerks the wheel-- EXT. RIVER -- DAY The truck BURSTS out of the corn and SPLASHES across the river and into an old, abandoned suburban housing development in the valley below, planted over with corn. ,1350
Half a mile in front of them, the Russian drone is still hugging the ground. ,102000
It has impossibly long, skinny wings, like an old U-2 surveillance plane, but no cockpit. ,26000
The tops of its wings are covered in black solar cells. ,197000
INT. TRUCK -- DAY Murph is fiddling with the computer. ,49300
His older brother takes the computer from him and fires up emulation software. ,224000
COOPER It's a Chinese military drone. ,5290000
Solar cells could power an entire farm. (TO TOM) Take the wheel. ,269000
Cooper hands Murph the Pringles can antenna. ,10100
COOPER (CONT'D) Keep it pointed right at it, OK? Murph nods. ,28900
Tom takes the wheel as his dad works the laptop, trying to communicate with the huge Russian drone. ,26
The screen fills with Cyrillic characters. ,1560000
COOPER (CONT'D) Faster, Tom. ,36200
I'm losing it. ,6090000
Tom WEAVES the truck at speed through the old, curved streets of the development, past oversized suburban mansions planted over with corn. ,6930
They round a corner and come face-to-face with a robot harvester. ,42700
Tom jerks the wheel to avoid it. ,173000
BANG -- the truck loses a wing mirror against the flank of the combine. 13. ,1480
EXT. SUBURBAN DEVELOPMENT -- DAY Tom guides the truck from street to street, trying to chart a straight path across the fields. ,197000
The truck BOUNCES as it SMASHES through an old picket fence. ,25700
Ahead, the drone is soaring, banking, pulling away. ,20000
INT. TRUCK -- DAY Cooper is still trying to hack into the drone's control circuitry as they leave the development behind and begin to climb into the foothills of the Sierras. ,993
EXT. RIDGELINE, HILLS -- DAY Tom guides the truck along the spine of the hills. ,19300
The drone soars overhead, making for the white tips of the Sierras. ,992000
INT. TRUCK -- DAY Cooper is oblivious to the picturesque surroundings as he concentrates on the laptop. ,5030
TOM (UNSURE) Dad? ,720000
COOPER Almost got it. ,8330000
Don't slow down. ,3210000
In front of them, Tom and his brother watch as the drone plummets from view. ,297000
TOM DAD. Cooper looks up. ,1140000
Ahead, the trail disappears as the edge of the hills falls away -- it's a three hundred-foot drop. ,41600
Tom locks up the brakes. ,241000
EXT. RIDGELINE, HILLS -- DAY The truck skids to a halt inches from a precipitous drop. ,1
Cooper climbs out, holding the laptop. ,127000
Murph climbs out next to him, still pointing the Pringles can. ,406
TOM We lost it. ,51400000
COOPER (SMILING) No we didn't. 14. ,3070000
Suddenly, the drone SOARS back over them. ,7200000
Cooper types a couple keys and then moves his fingers across the trackpad. ,53400
The huge drone banks and turns in response. ,37300
As the boys watch, Cooper sends the drone soaring high over them, banking and soaring along the tree-lined sides of the valley, light glinting from the black panels on its back. ,19000
It's a beautiful sight. ,56200000
Cooper crouches next to Murph. ,619000
COOPER (CONT'D) You want to give it a whirl? ,79100
Murph looks at his dad, wide-eyed. ,50800
He takes the laptop and moves his fingers gingerly across the pad. ,365000
In response, the massive plane banks into a tight turn in the valley below. ,160000
For a moment, Murph is in pure heaven, sending the drone dancing through the valley below. ,65900
COOPER (CONT'D) Set her down in the valley -- there, next to the river. ,397000
Murph leads the plane in a figure eight and then begins guiding it into a gentle landing in the valley floor below. ,1820
EXT. ABANDONED GOLF COURSE, VALLEY FLOOR -- DAY The truck limps along the overgrown fairway of a long-defunct golf course towards the massive hulk of the Russian drone, Cooper and the boys climb down. ,9
The valley is silent save for the truck's engine WHEEZING and SPUTTERING as it cools. ,5580
Cooper runs a hand over the smooth carbon flank of the drone. ,22500
TOM How long do you think it's been up there, Dad? ,11000000
COOPER Chinese mission control went down same as us, twenty years ago. ,48400
It's been up there ever since. ,388000
TOM What was it doing flying so low? ,280000
Cooper reads the information pouring into his laptop. 15. ,5380000
COOPER It was looking for something. ,404000
Intercepted some kind of signal. (SHRUGS) It's been at eighty thousand feet. ,4890
Sun probably cooked its brain. ,1170000
Cooper runs his hand along the flank till he finds an access patch. ,73000
He pulls out a crowbar and pries open the hatch. ,143000
Inside, surrounded by a nest of liquid cooling tubes, is a small black module -- the drone's auto-pilot. ,116000
Cooper looks down at Murph, who is standing at his elbow. ,61100
MURPH What are you going to do with it? ,101000000
COOPER Reprogram it. ,1
Give it something socially responsible to do like drive a combine or a tractor. ,1150000
MURPH (QUIET) Couldn't we just let it go? ,5160000
It's not hurting anyone. ,3480000
Cooper looks down at his son. ,2500000
Good kid. ,942000
COOPER We need all the help we can get, Murph. ,39700000
This thing has to adapt, just like the rest of us. ,234000
Cooper gently pries the control module out. ,623000
EXT. COUNTY SCHOOL -- DAY It's a small school, so all the kids and parents waiting in front know exactly who's driving the pickup truck with half of a Russian spy plane hanging out of the bed as it pulls up. ,73700
INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE, COUNTY SCHOOL -- DAY Cooper is ushered into the office. ,571000
The PRINCIPAL, 40s, an efficient-looking man, shakes his hand. ,130000
PRINCIPAL Good to see you, Mr. Cooper. ,595000
This is Ms. Kelly, Murph's teacher. ,17900
Cooper smiles at Ms. KELLY, 30s, attractive. 16. ,67700
PRINCIPAL (CONT'D) So we've gotten Tom's score back. ,2360
He's going to make an excellent farmer. ,304000
The principal slides a carbon copy across the desk to Cooper, who looks taken aback. ,26000
COOPER What about college? ,3
PRINCIPAL The University of California only accepts a few hundred students a year, Mr. Cooper. ,115000
You have to be realistic. ,146000000
COOPER You're ruling out college for him now? ,1160000
He's only fifteen. ,349000
PRINCIPAL I'm sorry. ,2740000
I'm afraid Tom's score simply isn't high enough. ,264000
COOPER What are you, about a 36-inch waist? (BEAT) 30-inch inseam? ,951000
PRINCIPAL I'm not sure I see-- COOPER You're telling me you need two numbers to measure your own ass, but just one to measure my son's future? ,54800
Ms. Kelly stifles a laugh, then, with a look from the principal, takes on the appropriate look of offense. ,829
PRINCIPAL I understand you're a well-educated man, Mr. Cooper. ,1170000
A scientist? ,4570000
COOPER Engineer. ,55200
PRINCIPAL Frankly, the world doesn't need any more engineers. ,413000
We didn't run out of trains or television sets or satellites. (BEAT) We ran out of food. 17. ,12400
Cooper leans back. ,1420000
He's not going to win this one. ,47000000
PRINCIPAL (CONT'D) The world needs farmers, Mr. Cooper. ,205000
And I'm sure your son Tom is going to make a fine one. (SMILES BENIGNLY) We're a caretaker generation. ,8080
But things are getting better. ,14300000
Maybe your grandchildren will be able to attend college. ,1560000
Cooper looks down, swallowing his anger. ,29000
COOPER Are we done? ,12
PRINCIPAL One more thing. ,53900000
Ms. Kelly here says that Murph brought a book to school about the lunar landings. ,62900
He slides an old textbook with a picture of a rocket on the cover across the desk to Cooper. ,38300
COOPER One of my old textbooks. ,759000
Murph liked the pictures. ,140000
MS. KELLY This is one of the old federal textbooks. ,222000
We've replaced them with corrected versions. ,77900000
COOPER Corrected? ,1470
MS. KELLY The new textbooks explain that the Apollo lunar missions were faked in order to bankrupt the Soviet Union. ,44
COOPER You don't believe we went to the moon? ,29200000
MS. KELLY I believe it was a brilliant piece of propaganda. ,32800
The Soviets spent years trying to build rockets and other useless machines. ,7960
COOPER "Useless machines"? 18. ,4000000
Cooper looks to the Principal for help. ,48300
None is forthcoming. ,5350
MS. KELLY Yes, Mr. Cooper. ,2260000
The kind of wastefulness and excess that the 20th century represented. ,263000
Your children would be better off learning about this planet, rather than reading fantasies about leaving it. ,234000
Cooper is silent for a long moment. ,207000
COOPER One of those useless machines they used to make was called an MRI. If we had any of them left the doctors might have been able to find the cyst in my wife's brain before she died, rather than afterwards. ,526
And then my kids could have been raised by two parents, instead of me and their pain-in-the-ass grandfather. ,672000
Ms. Kelly's face falls, ashen. ,408000
Cooper swallows his anger. ,99100
Most of it, anyway. ,9520000
COOPER (CONT'D) You ever consider the best thing for the world and humanity might have been for us to part company? ,11300
Cooper gets up to leave. ,4580000
INT. TRUCK, COUNTY SCHOOL PARKING LOT -- DAY Cooper climbs into the truck, trying to hold it together. ,974
He PUNCHES the wheel. ,621000
The radio KEYS to life. ,322000
He ignores it. ,1830000
Sits for a moment in misery. ,3190000
Finally he picks up the handset. ,309000
CB OPERATOR (O.S.) Got a call from Riggs, down in Galveston. ,551000
Says some of the tractors you built him went haywire last night. ,106000
COOPER Just tell him to power down the controllers for a couple minutes. ,1470000
CB OPERATOR (O.S.) I did. ,410000
He wants you to come down in person anyway. ,7780000
Says he found something you should take a look at. 19. ,613000
Cooper stares at the wheel. ,173000
Shakes his head in frustration. ,82000
EXT. AIRSTRIP -- DAY Cooper pulls his truck up to a grimy-looking hangar. ,2680
Pulls a tarp off of an ancient Piper Cub. ,31200
Checks it over. ,13000000
INT. PIPER CUB -- DAY Cooper guides the plane along a long sliver of deserted beach. ,7140
The radio crackles to life. ,8820000
COOPER Bravo-two-eight, requesting permission to enter your airspace. ,13100
AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL (O.S.) Permission granted. ,658000
Welcome to the sovereign nation of Texas. ,99500
Coop hangs up the radio. ,134000
Banks the plane inland. ,814000
EXT. GULF COAST -- DAY Below, a combine harvester fights its way up the dunes, trying to reach the beach, its wheels struggling for traction in the soft sand. ,20800
A MAN waves up at Cooper's plane as it circles overhead. ,321000
Cooper lands the plane on a deserted roadway. ,5530
Jumps down. ,394000
He intercepts one of the combines as it trundles past, trying to reach the dunes. ,6640
He pops open the cabin. ,3380000
Inside is a mess of wires hooked into an auto-pilot not unlike the one he ripped out of the drone. ,35000
He checks the fault code and resets the computer. ,159000
The man jogs over to meet him. ,26500000
RIGGS Thanks for coming down. ,81100000
Half of 'em took off last night, looking for something. (points to dunes) Looks like they found it, too. ,599000
I thought you were the man to see it. ,86200000
Riggs starts walking up the dune. ,198000
Cooper follows. ,6120
Below, on the beach, a dozen more combines and other farming vehicles are lined up at the tideline, warm gulf water lapping at their metal flanks. ,24
They are circling a deep crater. 20. ,22500
As they watch, an ancient autonomous SUB BEACHES itself, trying to reach the crater. ,5850
EXT. CRATER'S EDGE, BEACH -- DAY Cooper steps between the waiting machines and peers down into the crater. ,391000
At the very bottom is a ROUND BLACK BALL, about a foot across -- the same object we saw punch a hole in the side of a satellite. ,62000
Every few seconds, it emits a distinctive CHIRP. Cooper checks his rad meter. ,10700
A tiny reading -- non-lethal. ,9520000
He takes off his watch and hands it to Riggs. ,1610000
Then he slides down into the hole. ,1200000
The probe CHIRPS as Cooper slides down on top of it. ,105000000
He rubs a hand across its smooth composite bulk. ,1760000
RIGGS (FROM ABOVE) You think it's an alien? ,5740000
Cooper wipes sand off of the object, revealing the faint, familiar outline etched into the side of the probe: The stars and stripes of the old federal government. ,2140
COOPER Not exactly. ,13600000
EXT. CRATER'S EDGE, BEACH -- DAY Using a rope and a winch, Cooper hauls the blackened probe out of the crater and onto the beach. ,1340
Cooper hefts it up and carries it to the back of his plane. ,1000000
COOPER Space probe. ,12800000
Never seen one like it, though. ,2
Looks like it's been to hell and back. ,169000
The probe CHIRPS as Cooper belts it into the back. ,44200
RIGGS How do you think it wound up here? ,5760000
COOPER Lost, I guess. ,15100000
Guidance satellites would have been shot down by the Chinese twenty years ago. ,438000
Cooper looks at the probe for a second, admiring its form. 21. ,131000
INT. KITCHEN, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT Donald is pouring a bottle of corn beer into a bubbling vat of chowder. ,6010
He turns to watch Cooper work, amused. ,31300000
The probe has been clamped to the kitchen table. ,246000
Cooper works at the blackened case with a BLOWTORCH. Cooper gives up -- the torch hasn't made a scratch. ,6270
The probe CHIRPS. COOPER Well I don't know what the hell it's made of, but I can't crack it open. ,11600000
DONALD Good. ,13600
Clear it off the table so I can serve dinner. ,459000
Tom and Murph walk in. ,215000
Murph's got another black eye. ,140000
DONALD (CONT'D) What happened this time? ,124000
MURPH I got suspended. ,3240000
Paul said anyone who believed we went to the moon was an idiot. ,778000
So I hit him. ,311000
COOPER Good boy. ,17600000
Hand me the scanner. ,2600000
Murph hands his dad a defibrillator he's modified for the purpose. ,813000
He attaches the shock pads to the sides of the probe and turns on the power. ,47000
Numbers flash across the screen. ,1080000
Cooper hits a button on the controls and it PULSES. COOPER (CONT'D) Here we go. ,1020000
Standard NASA encryption. ,462000
Memory's been damaged. ,155000
Just noise. ,146000
Hold on. ,13800000
I've got something. ,14500000
Cooper unplugs a monitor from his computer and plugs it into the defibrillator. ,16900
After a moment, an image fills the screen: An ICE-COVERED PLANET nestled in the center of a system impossibly dense with stars. ,349
Murph stares, transfixed. ,20400
MURPH Where is that, dad? ,1050000
COOPER I don't know. ,16000000
Cooper looks at the probe. 22. ,191000
COOPER (CONT'D) Where the hell did you come from? ,120000
Cooper shrugs. ,648
Turns off the monitor. ,7850000
COOPER (CONT'D) We'll take it down to Tyson's tomorrow and have it melted down. ,132000
Might be some copper inside. ,4990000
MURPH But what about its mission? ,1400000
What about the information onboard? ,22100000
COOPER There's no one for it to report to. ,152000000
NASA is all gone. ,38800000
I'm sorry, son. ,2750000
It got home too late. ,234000
Donald pulls his chowder off the boil and slides the pot unceremoniously onto the table. ,67200
INT. DINING ROOM -- NIGHT The boys have gone to bed. ,423000
Cooper and Donald are alone at the table. ,3520000
Donald hands Cooper another beer. ,102000
DONALD I heard your meeting at the school didn't go so well. ,2200000
Cooper shakes his head in disgust. ,132000
COOPER Maybe it's better for everyone to forget what they did back then. ,40600000
Reminds us how far we've fallen. ,214000
DONALD (looks down,) When I was kid, it felt like they made something new every day. ,2750000
Some gadget or idea. (SMILES) Like every day was Christmas. (BEAT) But we made a lot of mistakes. ,22900
Six billion people. ,15100000
Just try to imagine that. ,10300000
Every last one of them trying to have it all. ,77900000
Donald rolls the bottle of beer in his hands. 23. ,185000
DONALD (CONT'D) The truth is this world isn't that bad. ,159000
In a lot of ways its better. ,49900
Tom will be all right, whether he goes to college or not. ,385000
COOPER It doesn't bother me that he can't go. ,3400000
It bothers me that he doesn't care. ,3560000
DONALD Tom isn't the problem. ,5700000
He fits in this world just fine. ,2350000
You're the one who doesn't fit, Coop. ,1920000
You don't belong here. ,8820000
You were born forty years too late, or forty years too early -- I don't know. ,331000
My daughter knew it, god bless her. ,229000
And your kids know it, too. ,63300000
Donald drains his beer. ,28500
Walks to the screen door. ,4670000
Stops, one hand on the frame. ,1030000
DONALD (CONT'D) You were good at something and you never got a chance to do anything with it. ,95000
And I'm sorry, Coop. ,92000
But that's not your kids' fault. ,88000000
Donald pushes out the screen door. ,1350000
Cooper looks at his beer. ,582000
The probe CHIRPS. INT. BEDROOM, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT Cooper flops down on his bed, fully clothed, exhausted. ,1620
He stares up at the ceiling. ,142000
This is his life. ,19800000
INT. BEDROOM, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT The air is filled with a PIERCING NOISE. Cooper BOLTS upright. ,66300
Stumbles out the door. ,10500000
INT. HALLWAY, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT Cooper's boys are in the hallway, exhausted. ,101000
Cooper, holding a baseball bat, makes his way down the stairs. ,154000
Cooper uses the bat to open the kitchen door. ,538000
INT. KITCHEN, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT Cooper steps in, Murph watching from behind him. 24. ,176000
The probe is clamped to the table, the chirp replaced with a DEAFENING SCREAM. Cooper, holding his ears, moves closer to the probe. ,2590
He hits it with the paddles. ,173000
No result. ,4480000
He SMASHES it with the bat. ,205000
He HITS it AGAIN and AGAIN. Finally, the clamps break off chunks of the table and the probe slams to the ground and ROLLS toward the front door. ,6650
As it rolls, it STOPS SHRIEKING. Cooper and the others watch it roll toward the door. ,81300
It stops at the wall. ,4350000
After a second, it begins SHRIEKING AGAIN. Cooper grabs it and rolls it toward the front door. ,52100
Once again, the movement shuts it up. ,1050000
EXT. PORCH, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT Cooper and his boys roll the probe out of the front door. ,146000
It BUMPS down the front steps and comes to rest in the dirt. ,2770000
After a moment, the unholy RACKET starts up again. ,67
Cooper keeps rolling it, but it doesn't seem to help. ,26900000
Murph looks up, sees the stars overhead. ,3280000
MURPH Try a different direction. ,142000
As they roll the probe in a circle, its SHRIEK stops, then picks up again. ,97500
Cooper zeroes in on the direction that keeps it quiet -- southwest -- and pushes it along in the dirt. ,55500
COOPER It's a fail-safe. ,175000
It's going to annoy us into taking it home. ,5330000
Cooper stops rolling the probe and, after a moment, it begins SHRIEKING again. ,60300
TOM What are we going to do? ,67500000
Cooper gets a rope. ,750000
COOPER We're going to get some sleep. ,2070000
He begins tying the rope around the probe. ,20000
INT. BEDROOM, COOPER'S HOUSE -- DAY Cooper wakes. ,1880000
He's been sleeping with a pillow wrapped around his head. ,1170000
The SHRIEK can be heard, but it's muffled, distant. 25. ,192000
INT. KITCHEN, COOPER'S HOUSE -- DAY Tom heads off for school with Donald. ,272000
Murph, still suspended, looks up at Cooper, smiling. ,167000
MURPH What are we doing today? ,79000000
COOPER You're staying here and cleaning the house. ,1620000
Murph looks crestfallen. ,1140000
He looks out towards the yard. ,53700
Cooper follows his stare. ,398000
COOPER (CONT'D) I told you, Murph. ,97500
There's no one to take it back to. ,123000000
MURPH But what if there is, dad? ,9980000
What if there's something we can salvage? ,39600000
Cooper thinks it over. ,1130000
Murph scrambles to get his shoes. ,34200
EXT. COOPER'S HOUSE -- DAY The shriek is still muffled. ,38300000
Cooper walks over to the well, putting in a pair of earplugs. ,184000
A line is staked off, leading down into the well below. ,14500000
Cooper begins hauling the line up. ,26600
As the probe breaks the surface of the water, the SHRIEK returns to its normal volume. ,8980
Cooper rolls the probe out onto the ground. ,385000
INT. PIPER CUB -- DAY The probe CHIRPS next to Murph in the backseat as Cooper spins the plane and guns the throttle and they bounce along the dusty runway and into the air. ,1
EXT. CALIFORNIA COAST -- DAY The tiny plane follows the mountains south. ,43100
EXT. SKIES OVER LOS ANGELES -- DAY Cooper flies in low. ,155000
Los Angeles looks much the same way it did in the early 20th century -- small settlements in Santa Monica and Downtown. ,49700
Wildfires and earthquakes have shaken and burned what was left of the homes in between. 26. ,27300
EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY, MALIBU -- DAY Cooper puts the plane down on the old highway and taxis up to a gas station. ,5200
Ahead, the Coast Highway peters out and disappears beneath rows of wild grass -- Malibu has become ranchland, once again. ,4740
EXT. GAS STATION, MALIBU -- DAY An OLD MAN looks up as Cooper steps out of the plane and checks it over. ,6190
COOPER Got any diesel? ,3280000
OLD MAN Plenty. ,16700000
Shame you can't eat it. ,1910000
Cooper stretches the hose over to the plane. ,332000
INT. PIPER CUB -- DAY Cooper rests a hand lightly on the controls as he follows the coast. ,58500
Murph gazes out the window. ,99900
In the backseat, the probe is HUMMING. A light marine layer beneath them parts, revealing SANTA CRUZ ISLAND, a large, uninhabited island. ,7570
As Cooper soars over the island, the probe HUMS, insistent. ,17400
MURPH I think it's home. ,277000
Cooper circles the island until he finds a long, flat grassland in the center of the island. ,126000
EXT. FIELD, SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- DAY The plane bounces and hops to a halt in waist-deep grass. ,34
Murph and Cooper climb down from the plane. ,12900
Cooper slings a rifle over his shoulder. ,116000
A few dozen yards from the plane they reach the tree line. ,158000
Murph stops, mesmerized by a patch of weeds studded with bright red -- strawberries. ,5460
MURPH Dad, what are these things? ,207000
COOPER I don't know. ,16000000
Don't touch them. 27. ,269000
Cooper spots something in the foliage ahead that looks a little off. ,2510000
He pokes at the undergrowth with his rifle. ,12500
The rifle CLANKS against something metal. ,460000
Cooper reaches -- it's a camouflage scrim. ,57300
He walks over. ,108000
He gently pulls it aside, revealing a chemical transport truck. ,8590
Cooper steps back, alarmed. ,55100
He brings up his rifle. ,2650000
Cooper curses and heads into the forest to look for him. ,122000
EXT. CLEARING, SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- DAY Cooper walks through a glade. ,5600
He stops to get his bearings. ,171000
Leans against a tree. ,42300000
Snatches his hand back -- the trunk of the tree is red hot. ,691000
Cooper steps back -- it's not a tree at all, but a camouflaged chimney stack. ,214000
He looks up: the tree is venting steam. ,9590000
Cooper walks a little further, until he finds several massive tanks. ,31400
The tanks are filling with a bubbling liquid -- some kind of industrial process is taking place beneath him. ,3270
Cooper finally catches up with Murph at the edge of a clearing. ,24300
COOPER Careful. ,531
There's some kind of underground facility here. ,2130000
We might... ,5200000
Cooper notices his son is frozen, staring at something: Standing bolt upright in the middle of the clearing, wearing an old straw hat, is an eight-foot-tall military spec ROBOT. MURPH Is it still... alive? ,19
COOPER Can't be. ,94900000
It's a marine. ,24100000
Haven't made them for thirty years. ,7510000
I've never seen one intact before. ,2790000
Cooper steps closer to the robot, which is frozen. ,49400
Its alloy frame heavily tarnished and weather-beaten. ,20300
It looks like it might have been standing here for decades. 28. ,114000
Cooper moves closer to it, looking into its blackened eyes. ,127000
He steps back, clearly a little spooked. ,85100
COOPER (CONT'D) I think we need to go, Murph. ,40700
MURPH But can't we take it back? ,26700
You could fix it up, get him to do chores. ,835000
COOPER No. I don't know what this place is, but we're leaving. ,5170000
Murph, ignoring his father, steps forward to touch the robot. ,170000
Suddenly, the robot SPRINGS into action, picking up the boy and hoisting him up to eye level. ,49200
Cooper, stunned, points the rifle at the robot. ,128000
The robot turns, dropping the boy, RIPS the rifle from Cooper's hands, BENDS it, then SLAMS him up against the side of the water tank. ,37200
Cooper punches him, then winces in agony. ,33000
Murph picks up the rifle and begins HITTING the robot as hard as he can. ,129000
The robot opens his mouth and addresses Cooper calmly in the clipped tones of a US marine. ,65300
ROBOT Tell the boy to stop hitting me. ,3690000
COOPER (IGNORING HIM) Hit him in the back of the neck. ,162000
Murph raises the rifle butt. ,56400
A voice stops him. ,3170000
VOICE (O.S.) I wouldn't do that. ,134000000
A woman, 30s, step out from the trees. ,4270000
This is AMELIA BRAND -- tough, bright, and a decent shot with the large rifle that she's pointing at Cooper. ,29800
COOPER We were just looking for salvage. ,5290000
BRAND Is that what they call stealing these days? ,165000
COOPER I didn't know it belonged to anyone. 29. ,2240000
BRAND It doesn't. (TO ROBOT) You want to let them go, Tars, or do you want some help with your work? ,332000
The robot, evidently named Tars, looks at Cooper closely. ,24100
Then lets him go. ,24100000
COOPER You've got me wrong, lady. ,42600000
BRAND Really? ,61500
You're not the kind of guy who turns a combat marine with a supercomputer for a brain into a riding lawn mower? ,62600
Cooper says nothing -- she's not that far off the mark. ,572000
BRAND (CONT'D) Get back in your little plane, go back to your farming commune. ,140000
And don't come back. ,52100000
Cooper backs up. ,1340000
Tars holds up his mangled rifle. ,60100
TARS Don't forget your gun. ,3750000
COOPER (points at Tars) Word of advice -- careful with that thing. ,1490000
When the war was over, they didn't know when to stop fighting. ,4900000
BRAND I'd trust him a lot more than I'd trust you. ,6300000
Cooper backs up to his plane. ,5180000
Tars follows him. ,5400000
Suddenly, in the plane, the probe emits a high-pitch SQUEAL. Tars responds instantly, striding past Cooper to the plane. ,4
He sees the probe. ,925000
Tries to open the door. ,986000
It's locked. ,412000
COOPER Wait a second-- Tars TEARS the door off the plane. ,41800
Reaches inside and pulls out the probe. ,3940000
The woman looks at it, stunned. ,3920000
BRAND Get it inside. (MORE) 30. ,885000
BRAND (CONT'D) (points rifle at Cooper) You too. ,264000
We'll figure out what to do with you later. ,22300000
Tars stops, and two panels open in the ground, revealing a huge, reinforced service elevator. ,14100
INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR, UNDERGROUND BUNKER -- DAY Brand waves at a security camera and the lift begins to glide diagonally down a tunnel that cuts hundreds of feet below the island's surface. ,35300
She keeps her weapon shouldered. ,27300
COOPER Now who's stealing from who? ,26200000
BRAND This doesn't belong to you. ,3060000
COOPER You're right. ,82
It belongs to NASA, which shut down thirty years ago when the federal government ran out of money. ,16900
Brand says nothing. ,13900000
The elevator slows to a stop at the bottom of the tunnel. ,42900
Heavy BLAST DOORS grind open and Brand motions for Cooper to step forward. ,2870000
INT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER -- DAY They step into a vast underground facility. ,28100
Standing in the center, braced by a launch tower, is a ten story tall rocket. ,30700
Dozens of ROBOTS are working on in, maintaining it. ,228000
Cooper, stunned, looks at Brand. ,7130000
COOPER Who are you people? ,8880000
BRAND (WRY) The government gave us plenty of practice looking for our own funding. (gestures with rifle) Keep moving. ,2540
Tars carries the probe over to an area of the hangar filled with electronic equipment. ,43900
A group of ENGINEERS and ROBOTS converge around Tars. ,158000
An OLDER ENGINEER looks familiar -- 70s, white-haired, this is Ansen's assistant at Caltech who we met fifty years earlier. 31. ,44
BRAND (CONT'D) I found them outside with it. ,345000
It looks like six. ,35100
Maybe seven. ,48700
I can't tell from the radiation damage. ,172000
The older engineer looks at the probe, astonished. ,12200
OLD ENGINEER Where did you find it? ,16200000
COOPER Galveston. ,1810
BRAND'S FATHER (thinking it over) Of course. ,75000
It must have been looking for Canaveral. ,40100
Tars bolts the probe down into a purpose built rig. ,168000
DOYLE, 40s, an engineer, begins hooking leads into the probe. ,24200
COOPER Canaveral's been gone for thirty years. ,72100
Brand ignores him. ,1350000
Doyle looks up from his monitor, frustrated. ,2470000
DOYLE It's not responding to the handshake. ,332000
I can't open anything on primary. ,1320000
Brand looks up at Cooper. ,3300000
BRAND What did you do to it? ,192000000
COOPER Nothing. ,6210
I got something off of it. ,77800000
Cooper looks around. ,13200000
There's a safety station on the wall with a battery powered defibrillator. ,220000
COOPER (CONT'D) (TO BRAND) May I? ,99200
Brand nods, wary. ,24300
Cooper walks over to the wall, takes the defibrillator, and hooks it up to the probe. ,46500
He taps into the current and runs a lead into the terminal. ,192000
Roth looks at the stars, then back to his model. ,628000
ROTH The smaller black hole. ,158000
We're much closer to it than the models predicted. ,389000
We're being pulled by its swirl. ,26800000
Very quickly. ,3730000
The crew looks out through the hull. ,6360000
They are being pulled into Pantagruel's swirl -- a glittering disc of matter spinning at high speed around the hole. ,7660
Doyle looks behind them. ,6790000
The wormhole mouth is rapidly growing smaller. ,198000
CASE Doyle. ,4050
Fire the engines. ,22400000
The ship's engines FIRE, straining to fight the irresistible pull of the supermassive black hole. ,12100
They won't be able to fight it for long. ,9280000
DOYLE We're being pulled into it? ,6120000
ROTH No. I don't think so... ,114000000
Roth looks at the instrumentation for a moment. ,69
ROTH (CONT'D) It appears to be pulling us on exactly the trajectory we modelled. ,887
If we try to fight it, we could push ourselves off of that trajectory. ,197000
DOYLE You don't know that. ,1670000
Case stares ahead into the darkness. ,13400
ROTH We should turn off the engines. ,3990000
Let the swirl take us. ,2010000
DOYLE (FRANTIC) Listen to me. (MORE) 66. ,209000
DOYLE (CONT'D) If the modelling was wrong, then we can't be sure about anything. ,202000
We need to go back. ,80700000
Case thinks it over. ,13500000
CASE Shut down the engines. ,847000
The engines shut down. ,7490000
SILENCE. The ship drifts for a moment in the swirl, then begins to move. ,8960
EXT. ENDURANCE The ship accelerates as it is pulled by the irresistible force of the black hole onto an inspiraling orbit. ,3120
INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE The crew watch as the ship hurtles around the black hole at higher and higher speeds. ,376
The sky overhead begins to spin due to their motion -- faster and faster until it becomes a blur. ,15
The ship begins to GROAN as it appears to be pulled in two different directions. ,130000
The ship is now speeding around the black hole at incredible speed -- one revolution every four seconds. ,13200
The crew are suddenly SLAMMED against the hull in opposite directions -- some towards the black hole, some towards the opposite side. ,8940
Roth looks at his model, which shows the projected path of the ship. ,72300
It looks perilously close to the event horizon. ,560000
ROTH It's the tidal gravity caused by the black hole. ,38600
It means we're right on the critical orbit. ,193000
The comms screen lights up, TONING again and again, as it receives a long garbled update. ,798
Then it shuts down. ,14400000
Cooper drags himself along the hull until he reaches the controls. ,25300
COOPER We've lost contact with the relay. ,1100000
Case joins Cooper at the comms screen. ,1120000
While they're distracted, Doyle maneuvers himself over to the engine control. 67. ,34500
COOPER (CONT'D) One long garbled transmission came in. ,52600
Then nothing. ,579000
Case looks at the screen. ,988000
Suddenly, the ship is JOLTED as the engines fire at full power. ,934000
The crew looks over. ,8480000
Doyle is standing by the controls. ,216000
DOYLE I'm sorry. ,2640000
I can't let you kill us. ,105000000
We have to go back. ,2480000
The engines strain to fight the swirl -- but they're hopelessly outgunned by the gravity of the black hole. ,9760
EXT. ENDURANCE Instead of reversing course, the Endurance begins to speed up, as it plummets closer and closer to the black hole. ,8420
INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE Doyle's face sinks as he watches the controls -- on the 'volcano' model, the ship is now passing the crest and spiraling towards destruction. ,76
He has made a tragic mistake. ,2610000
DOYLE Why isn't it slowing down? ,46800
ROTH We're being pulled towards the event horizon. ,152000
ALARMS begin sounding throughout the ship as the projected course on Roth's model shifts, showing the Endurance being pushed up the rim, past the critical orbit and down towards the black hole's event horizon. ,10700
Case takes control of the ship, trying to fire the engines forwards to speed them back up to safety, but it's too late. ,73400
CASE (CALM) The engines don't have enough power to push us back. ,11900000
ROTH They would if we used it all at once. ,78900000
Cooper is still trying to understand what Roth means as Tars locks himself into the engine compartment. 68. ,42100
COOPER What is he doing? ,37300000
BRAND Saving us. ,253000
Tars tears open the engine's control panel and begins overriding it. ,8980
EXT. ENDURANCE Tars rips out the cooling circuitry. ,10400
Then, holding on tight, he fires the engine. ,775000
INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE The crew watch as Tars holds the engine, blasting it at full power into the swirl. ,695
The engine heats up white-hot. ,6350000
ROTH Prime the remaining engine. ,282000
When he detonates it, we'll only have a few seconds. ,5400000
If we overshoot we could be pulled into the bigger hole. ,716000
Roth moves to the controls. ,2750000
CASE Secure yourselves. ,19300000
The ship should be able to withstand the blast. ,4240000
COOPER What about Tars? ,3780000
As the crew watches, Tars continues to hold the engine even as the casing around it begins to melt. ,8440
Finally, it EXPLODES. EXT. SPACE Tars is thrown backwards from the explosion, tumbling through space as the ship is ROCKETED upwards. ,755
INT. ENDURANCE The ship is SLAMMED by the explosion. ,439000
Cooper and the rest of the crew are SMASHED against the hull. ,120000
Doyle is knocked unconscious. ,793000
Brand steps over to him and cradles his head, trying to protect him. ,1060000
On Roth's model, the course slowly pushes outward, out of the danger zone, back to the original delicate orbit. ,14100
As they near the original orbit, Case fires the remaining engine, pushing them back onto the outspiraling orbit. 69. ,8080
CASE It's going to be close, but we're going to make it. ,1810000
Brand looks at the instruments. ,96600
Points to a tiny radar contact receding towards the massive black hole. ,9500
BRAND Tars. ,180000
His transponder is still working. ,6930000
The ship's instruments TONE every few seconds as it communicates with Tars' onboard computer. ,22
ROTH He's being pulled toward Gargantua. ,2200000
We can't help him. ,248000
The crew watch, helpless, as the tones grow further and further apart. ,139000
Then they stop. ,152000
Cooper looks at Doyle, anger rising. ,10300
Then he looks down. ,75900
EXT. SPACE AROUND PANTAGRUEL The Endurance slowly spirals back away from Pantagruel, the sky slowing as the orbit grows longer. ,28
Finally, a tiny speck of light appears in front of the ship. ,946000
INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE Roth watches as the Endurance races back away from the black hole and into a perfect orbit around a tiny ice planet. ,191
Roth looks up from his screen, smiling. ,7990000
ROTH We're here. ,99000
INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE As Roth and Doyle study the frozen planet below, Cooper tries in vain to signal the relay on the Earth side of the wormhole. ,2
Brand and Case are having a private conversation away from everyone else. ,2460000
Cooper walks over. ,13400000
COOPER I still can't contact the relay. ,162000
Brand ignores him at first. ,1360000
She nods at Case. 70. ,85900
COOPER (CONT'D) Did you hear me? ,102000
We're not able to communicate back home. ,3350000
She waves him off. ,3580000
But she looks shaken by something. ,361000
BRAND I've already checked it. ,1230000
It's electromagnetic interference. ,436000
We'll try again in a few hours. ,33100
Cooper begins to ask her what's wrong, but she moves off. ,1490000
Roth looks up from his monitor, excited. ,1230000
ROTH I've got a signal. ,3360000
But it's local. ,33100000
A familiar CHIRP plays over the ship's speakers. ,58800
ROTH (CONT'D) The remaining probes. ,170000
We found them. ,56100000
She looks at the monitor. ,28000
The probes ping the ship with their locations, which pop up on the monitor. ,145000
They're all clustered in one spot. ,7
COOPER How could they all have landed in the same place? ,3880000
ROTH (SMILES) Let's go find out. ,1640000
Case programs a course that will lock the ship in orbit above the probes on the surface. ,36400
EXT. SPACE ABOVE ICE PLANET The ship settles into orbit a few hundred kilometers above the surface of the ice planet. ,860
It can't get any closer: The space below it is choked with hundreds of tiny moons -- a cruder version of Saturn's rings. ,8070
The moons are hurtling around the planet at high speed. ,171000
INT. AIRLOCK, ENDURANCE Brand ushers Doyle into the landing module. ,2300
Cooper objects. ,16300
COOPER We're bringing him along? 71. ,1070000
BRAND We need all the help we can get. ,112000000
Besides, the alternative is to leave him on the ship alone. ,268000
You think he'll still be here when we get back? ,1220000
Cooper steps aside, allowing Doyle onboard. ,6840
EXT. SPACE ABOVE ICE PLANET The lander detaches from Endurance, rolls over on its belly, and FIRES thrusters to sink towards the planet's surface. ,3
INT. LANDER The crew watches, fascinated, as the ship descends, navigating between the moons that hurtle past. ,2390
The moons are vastly different than our own; potato shaped and only one to two miles in circumference, they are hugged in a close embrace with the ice planet, only a few hundred thousand feet from the surface. ,11500000
EXT. SURFACE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT The lander touches down on the ghostly surface of the planet. ,67
EXT. SURFACE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT After a moment, the hatch HISSES open and the team steps out, led by Case, holding a rifle. ,66
The team sets out, moving slowly in their cumbersome suits. ,58900
Lit by the nebula, the surroundings are a little brighter than a full moon on Earth. ,63700
Not that there's much to look at. ,98700000
They are standing on a sea of ice, which spreads for miles. ,177000
In the distance, small rock formations break through the ice. ,191000
Brand takes a surface reading of the ice. ,276000
BRAND (RADIO) The probe was right. ,8880000
Looks like significant amounts of oxygen trapped in the ice. ,298000
Case leads the way, drawn by a signal only he can hear. ,99500
He walks fifty yards, then stops on a gentle slope that leads down into a small valley. 72. ,181000
CASE The other probes should be directly beneath us. ,84500
Case and the others begin digging into the hillside. ,445000
Cooper is drawn to a small mound in the middle of the valley, four feet high. ,32800
He takes out a small folding shovel and begins scraping at the ice and snow. ,12400
Case hits something solid. ,1390000
But it's not a probe. ,93700000
He digs around a little more, then reaches up and hacks away at the hillside, revealing the outline of something metal: A door. ,36100
They're not standing at the base of a hill -- it's a shelter. ,3180000
The crew stands back, unsure what to make of it. ,2240000
A few feet away, Cooper cuts enough of the mound away to reveal something flexible -- fabric caked with ice. ,12000
He scrapes away the snow, revealing a bright patch of red fabric: It's the flag of the People's Republic of China. ,29800
BRAND How could the Chinese have gotten here first? ,5500000
The federal government kept the wormhole a secret. ,26900
Case shrugs. ,876
He has a soldier's gallows humor about his old employer's ability to keep anything a secret. ,16500
CASE They didn't do a very good job. ,4710000
Case reaches for the door of the shelter. ,2710000
It's sealed shut with ice. ,84900
He wrenches it open. ,664000
INT. CONTROL MODULE, CHINESE BASE CAMP -- NIGHT Case steps into the shelter, followed by the rest of the crew. ,100000
His lights pick up several years worth of dust. ,667000
Case steps up to an equipment locker. ,771000
Forces it open. ,12500000
Inside are half a dozen black probes. ,16200
Exposed to light, the probes begin TONING like the one Cooper found in Texas. ,26700
DOYLE The Chinese must have captured them. ,44400000
So they couldn't return to us. ,13300000
The crew stare at the probes for a moment, taking it in. ,219000
BRAND Then how did the probe that Cooper found return? 73. ,533000
ROTH The more immediate question is what happened to the Chinese expedition. ,616000
There's no sign of their ship in orbit. ,12500000
Roth picks up an ancient vacuum sealed package of pickled egg. ,91700
Virtually none of the rations have been eaten. ,1310000
EXT. VALLEY, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT Cooper and Brand scrape ice from one of the other small hills surrounding the valley, revealing another structure. ,37
Cooper forces the door open. ,519000
INT. BARRACKS, CHINESE BASE CAMP, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT Cooper and Brand let themselves in. ,6250
The shelter is well stocked with food and equipment. ,76000
Brand is taking readings with a radiation detector. ,57600
BRAND The whole place has been dosed with huge levels of radiation. ,251000
What happened here? ,297000
Cooper looks at the pieces of a modular, one-person rocket, a last-ditch means of escape, stored, untouched in the shelter. ,17800
He steps back, realizing something. ,61400000
COOPER This is the Taichung mission. ,152000
BRAND The Mars mission? ,665000
The Chinese claimed it had been destroyed on landing. ,821000
Cooper looks over the relay log. ,7440000
COOPER They never landed. ,8710000
Not on Mars. ,253000
Four human crew, fifteen robots. ,171000
The log says the base has been here for thirty years. ,8200000
Case's familiar voice comes through the radio. ,2610000
CASE (O.S.) I've found something. 74. ,427000
INT. UTILITY MODULE, CHINESE BASE CAMP -- NIGHT The structure is filled with drilling equipment. ,86300
Cooper and the rest of the team stand at the edge of a three-foot hole that has been drilled into the ice. ,25100
A descending rig is anchored to the top of the hole. ,51900
Doyle and Case struggle to pull themselves out of the hole. ,40100
DOYLE It goes down for a hundred and fifty feet, then stops. ,125000
Tunnel's old -- the ice has reformed at the bottom. ,7480000
BRAND I'm going to descend to take some samples. ,205000
Cooper, want to make yourself useful? ,3190000
Cooper begins to say something, then bites his tongue. ,174000
EXT. LANDER -- NIGHT Cooper emerges, loaded down with several containers of Brand's equipment. ,282000
As he struggles through the wind and snow, his radio picks up data chatter between the mother ship and Case. ,14600
The comms are just noise. ,8710000
After a moment, Case's voice cuts in. ,113000
CASE (O.S.) Get back here, Cooper. ,1980000
We've got a problem. ,79300000
Cooper continues to wade through the snow. ,308000
Suddenly, he trips over something, dropping the equipment. ,6910000
Cooper looks back. ,22500000
He tripped on a white plastic post sticking out of the snow. ,121000
He dusts it off, to reveal a picture of a Chinese Taikonaut smiling in his flight suit. ,94
This is a grave marker. ,11400000
Cooper sweeps his hand through the snow, revealing three more white posts with pictures. ,34900
The entire human crew has been buried here. ,1700000
INT. UTILITY MODULE, CHINESE BASE CAMP -- NIGHT Roth and Case are looking at a portable monitor, showing a projection of the nearby system -- the ice planet is a speck orbiting the local black hole. ,5380
COOPER The entire human crew is buried out there in the snow. 75. ,879000
Roth looks up from the monitor and assesses the situation with his usual detachment. ,30700
ROTH I think I know what killed them. ,65200
This planet isn't the only thing orbiting this black hole. ,1820000
Roth zooms the monitor in, revealing a tiny, impossibly-bright object appearing at the horizon of the black hole. ,27300
ROTH (CONT'D) It's a neutron star. ,183000
The black hole shields the planet's surface from it for twenty hours at a stretch. ,47600
Time's about up. ,5030
Even Brand looks rattled. ,954000
BRAND How long do we have left? ,131000000
ROTH About five minutes. ,6880000
COOPER Then what? ,14200000
BRAND Then we die. ,11200000
The radiation will cook us alive. ,43300
Cooper looks around, their predicament settling in. ,919000
Case walks over to the edge of the mine shaft. ,55000
CASE We have to go down. ,57500000
COOPER What about returning to the ship? ,3300000
BRAND Not enough time. ,15100000
Case is right. ,18100000
The ice can shield us from some of the x-rays. ,2670000
DOYLE It would take a thousand feet of ice to shield us. ,37500000
Brand gives up on the argument, sheds her equipment and clips herself to the line to follow Case down into the ice. ,51000
Cooper looks at Doyle, then follows her. 76. ,202000
INT. ICE MINE SHAFT -- NIGHT Cooper descends into the shaft. ,19500
The only light is from his suit's light array. ,5530000
COOPER What is this? ,7880000
BRAND A pocket formed by gas. ,210000
There may be more below. ,73000000
The ice below them reveals nothing but murky blackness. ,13100
Case has found some of the equipment left behind by the Chinese -- a battery-powered drill and a pick. ,34100
DOYLE We'll never make it far enough down. ,747000
BRAND Shut up. ,5400000
How much time do we have, Roth? ,3090000
Roth checks his watch with his usual detachment. ,4430000
ROTH About three minutes or so until we're fully exposed. ,31400
The rad meter Brand is holding begins to CHIRP with activity -- the radiation levels are rising. ,31900
The ice will not be enough to protect them. ,13000000
Cooper sees that Brand has exhausted herself with the pick. ,27900
He takes over for her. ,4290000
The drill that Case is operating GROANS as the thirty-year- old battery runs out of charge. ,59100
Case casts it aside and begins SMASHING at the ice with his bare hand. ,41400
Brand is looking at the walls of the ice pocket, looking for fissures. ,205000
Her lights pick out something in the ice. ,8340000
She LOOKS CLOSER: Tiny black flecks. ,842000
Brand, ever the scientist, forgets their predicament and begins chipping at the ice. ,22000
BRAND I've found something. ,1450000
Case continues to pummel the ice with his hand, which is badly smashed. 77. ,26300
He pulls off the hand and continues to hack away at the ice with the stump, trying to save his crew. ,23700
Brand is examining a piece of ice in her hands, which contains several black flecks. ,33100
As she shines her light on them, they FLUORESCE, giving off a tiny flicker of light, like a firefly. ,1000000
Brand steps back. ,27400000
BRAND (CONT'D) These things... they're alive. ,41500
Roth joins her, looking down at the tiny creatures trapped in the ice. ,48300
Brand shines her flashlight over the ice again, but nothing happens. ,6150000
Roth takes the depth meter dangling by a lanyard from Brand's suit. ,11900
ROTH It's not your light they're responding to. ,893000
It's this-- Roth takes the depth meter and waves it over the ice. ,2470000
Suddenly, the black flecks begin to shine. ,25800
BRAND X-rays. ,3030000
They feed on them and emit visible light. ,30700000
They've found a way to survive here. ,5690000
Roth looks at the shimmering light of the tiny life-forms trapped in the ice, mesmerized. ,226000
Case hammers down with his arm, gouging a deep hole in the ice below. ,288000
Suddenly, GAS sprays back up at him. ,6600000
He's found the gas pocket beneath them. ,1940000
Roth's rad meter begins BEEPING frantically. ,146000
EXT. ICE PLANET -- ALIEN DAWN Overhead, a tiny ball is orbiting into view from the dark side of the black hole -- the NEUTRON STAR. Its humble size belies its power. ,406
As its rays hit the ice, the ice CRACKLES with energy. ,104000
INT. ICE MINE SHAFT -- ALIEN DAWN Brand steps back from the ice in awe as it begins to glow. ,2430
The microbes are absorbing the x-rays and emitting light. ,204000
Within seconds, they are bathed in an incredible glow. ,1040000
Even Cooper stops, awed by the beauty of the display. ,7330000
Only Case is unmoved, continuing to SMASH at the ice with the broken end of his wrist. 78. ,48400
BRAND (looks at rad meter) They're absorbing most of the x-rays. ,18500
ROTH Not enough, unfortunately. ,7150000
Suddenly, a CRACK as Case punches into the ice. ,101000
Cooper looks down -- a great fissure has opened in the ice beneath them. ,9330000
COOPER Case, wait-- Case PUNCHES again. ,6600000
Suddenly, with a great BANG, the ice floor disintegrates beneath them. ,183000
They fall into the darkness. ,1740000
INT. CAVERN -- ALIEN DAWN Cooper falls. ,17
For a moment, the only light he can see is from Case, falling calmly a few yards beneath him. ,1200000
As they fall, the light from the microbes trapped in the ice above sweeps across the inside of the cavern, illuminating the floor of the massive cavern thousands of feet down. ,4740
The rock formations they saw on the surface are actually the tip of a mountain range extending into the distance, disappearing into the ice above as if it were cloud cover. ,1320
The base of the mountains is covered in a thick jungle-like foliage that runs into a perfectly-still inland sea. ,30100
On the far side of the sea, another mountain range stretches into the distance, supporting the thick ice and rock cavern roof. ,4550
Cooper only has a few seconds to take this in -- he is falling towards the huge inland sea below. ,38800
Seconds before impact, a tiny warning light flickers on inside his helmet: IMPACT DETECTED. Suddenly, a small drag chute EXPLODES from a panel on the back of suit, slowing his fall. ,2780
Airbags EXPLODE on his legs and torso to cushion the impact. ,131000
Cooper SMASHES into the water. ,410000
BLACKNESS. EXT. UNDERWATER -- DAY Cooper comes to underwater, as liquid is flowing into his suit from his shattered helmet. 79. ,8960
Bubbles pour out from his suit and Cooper GASPS as his helmet fills with water and he begins to sink. ,25700
As he sinks, Cooper pulls off his helmet, then tears off pieces of his suit. ,2130000
He forces himself through the neck of the suit and then swims upward. ,7840
He is about to surface when he remembers where he is. ,492000
He hesitates, just beneath the surface, lungs tightening as he runs out of oxygen. ,28
EXT. SEA, ICE PLANET -- DAY Cooper breaks the surface, COUGHS out water, and takes a panicked breath. ,14
Nothing happens. ,1390000
He opens his mouth again and breathes in almost pure oxygen. ,78900
He can breathe. ,7980000
Treading water, he looks around. ,322000
Spots lights in the water below nearby -- Brand, in her suit, is sinking. ,172000
He dives down and struggles to haul her up by the suit. ,3110000
Cooper breaks the surface, looks at Brand. ,348000
Her mask is also broken. ,9430000
COOPER Breathe. ,1850
She refuses at first. ,101000
Water is bubbling into her suit through the open mask. ,4070000
Finally, she takes a deep breath. ,3080000
COOPER (CONT'D) Your suit is filling with water. ,169000
I'm not going to be able to hold it much longer. ,689000
I'm going to let go. ,43100
Brand's eyes widen. ,8300000
BRAND What do you mean, you're going to let go? ,6720000
COOPER Take a deep breath. ,1270000
Brand takes a deep breath and Cooper lets go of her. ,132000
EXT. UNDERWATER -- DAY Brand sinks. ,52100
Cooper swims down, following her, ripping away at her suit. ,12500
The tear-away seals on her suit are stuck fast, damaged in the fall. 80. ,45000
Cooper finally breaks them off. ,4700000
Brand pulls herself out, free, and they swim for the surface. ,78000
EXT. SHORE, ICE PLANET -- DAY Cooper drags himself out of the water and onto the beach. ,98
He turns back to offer Brand a hand. ,5510000
She waves him off. ,3580000
BRAND I don't need your help. ,140000000
COOPER I thought we were supposed to be a collective organism. ,431000
They sit together, soaking wet, trying to catch their breath. ,124000
BRAND Thank you. ,26700000
COOPER Don't mention it. ,185000
Cooper feels the rocks beneath him, which are translucent, like glass, and polished to an impossible shine. ,2400
He looks up to see Case dragging Roth and Doyle, still in their suits, out of the water. ,15800
EXT. SHORE, ICE PLANET -- DAY Doyle and Roth have stripped down from their suits and are breathing in the pure oxygen atmosphere. ,17
Case and Cooper are pulling modular pieces from their equipment packs to form a small shelter. ,79100
Brand is taking readings with her instruments. ,166000
BRAND Oxygen atmosphere. ,1830000
Pure water. ,2500000
Temperate climate. (TO COOPER) You still think this is a coincidence? ,701000
Cooper looks at the tree line, less convinced. ,246000
COOPER Looks like we can climb up the mountains back to the ice. ,569000
We're down to three suits. ,1440000
We'll have to send someone ahead to get a fourth. 81. ,4140000
BRAND I won't need one. ,59100000
BRAND Because I'm not going anywhere. ,1010000
This is our new home. ,1010000
Brand picks up some of her instruments and a sample case and hikes into the jungle. ,84100
EXT. SHORE, ICE PLANET -- DAY Cooper finishes constructing the modest shelter. ,48
They load the suits and the rest of their gear inside. ,198000
COOPER Any sign of Brand? ,49900000
ROTH She's still taking samples. ,736000
If you find her, tell her to head back. ,44000000
Night should be falling soon. ,9290000
COOPER What happens then? ,2650000
ROTH Your guess is as good as mine. ,571000
Cooper hikes into the jungle to look for Brand. ,174000
BRAND This is incredible. ,364000
The organisms trapped in the ice above absorb x- rays and emit light. ,79900
In return, these plants absorb the light and emit oxygen, which feeds the animals trapped in the ice. ,5470
Brand cuts off a sample and drops it into the case. ,1080000
The transparent wall of the case magnifies the structure onto the glass automatically. ,11000
She compares it with the flecks she collected in the ice above, fascinated. 82. ,9750
BRAND (CONT'D) Look at this. ,79600000
I think they're the same organism at a different stage of the life cycle. (shows him the sample) It's fractal. ,162000
No individual cells -- the structure repeats all the way down. ,1340000
Cooper looks at the sample, then continues scanning the jungle around them, nervous. ,56900
COOPER Any sign of big life-forms? ,66100000
BRAND The soil's been disturbed. ,572000
So something's been moving. ,163000
But I haven't seen anything. (notices his look) Cooper... are you nervous? ,1300000
Cooper stops scanning the trees, embarrassed. ,10200
COOPER I just think we should get back to the shelter before night falls. ,2220000
Night is falling. ,15900000
BRAND (LAUGHING) Relax. ,12000000
If there are any large organisms here, even predatory ones, they're not going to attack us -- they have no idea what we are. ,156000
COOPER You don't know that. ,1680000
You just have blind faith this place is going to be some kind of Eden. ,179000
Brand stops. ,4140
He's struck a nerve. ,176000
BRAND (truly pissed off) Faith has nothing to do with it. ,296000
You know what you are, Cooper? ,147000000
You're just another in a long line of people saying 'no.' That this isn't going to work. ,1940000
And frankly, I don't have to convince you. 83. ,7320000
COOPER What's that supposed to mean? ,2130000
BRAND You're on this mission because you're another pair of hands. ,6850000
You want the truth? ,5030000
I told Case we should bring another robot over you. ,182000
At least then I could just reprogram you to- She stops. ,1920000
Something has caught her attention. ,4820000
COOPER What? ,139000
BRAND Nothing. ,15100
I just -- I could have sworn it just moved. ,96500
She walks to the thick, knotted trunk of a tree. ,21900
Puts a hand on it. ,14200000
Overhead, the ice flickers out and the darkness begins to descend, more rapidly than on Earth. ,8720
Suddenly, the tree SHUDDERS. Then, the bark begins to ooze over Brand's fingers. ,12100
Brand snaps her hand away and steps back. ,50900
Even for her, this is too much. ,242000
She turns back to Cooper, who is looking at the jungle around them, spooked. ,148000
COOPER You know how plants don't usually move? ,22500000
Is that a universal rule? ,16600000
BRAND No. There really aren't any rules. ,3740000
All around them, the life-forms begins to melt toward the ground, breaking down into different, smaller forms. ,83
BRAND (CONT'D) (trying to stay calm) Remember, we're the aliens. ,5730
Cooper steps back as several pieces of the nearest tree drop onto the ground and begin scuttling toward him. ,5960
BRAND (CONT'D) Hold very still. ,106000
Don't make any sudden movements. ,79200000
Two of the pieces join together, stacking themselves up and staggering toward him. 84. ,14100
A third piece climbs onto the first two, looking for a good place to hang on. ,23100
After a moment it hunkers down on top, forming a crude head. ,52400
Thirty eye-like structures blink open on the creature. ,32600
The skin of the life-form begins to flicker with a dim light like the animals trapped in the ice above, bathing Cooper and Brand in a warm glow. ,7820
The creature creeps closer to them, taking them in. ,238000
Cooper tries his best to seem non-threatening. ,42700
COOPER Hello there. ,14000000
The creature lurches toward him on three legs, then its head splits open and it BELLOWS. COOPER (CONT'D) OK. Now we run. ,59000
Brand doesn't argue. ,8
They turn and sprint through the trees. ,150000
EXT. JUNGLE -- NIGHT Cooper and Brand smash headlong through the jungle. ,126000
At first, they're running from the rumbling, smashing melee behind them. ,771000
But as they run, the entire jungle around them begins to break apart and move. ,351000
After a moment, they're surrounded. ,15100000
The jungle is completely disassembling itself into a million different pieces, each one a different size and shape than the others. ,2680
COOPER We have to reach the shelter. ,2500000
They head off, crashing through the melee. ,627000
EXT. SHORE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT Case, Doyle and Roth are standing in front of the shelter finishing the day's work. ,5410
Doyle turns around. ,702000
The jungle is breaking apart and crawling down the beach towards them. ,162000
DOYLE I think we've got a problem. ,819000
Case and Roth look up to see the organisms picking up speed as they move towards them. ,358000
Roth begins to step out towards them. 85. ,126000
ROTH Fascinating. ,345
I think- Case grabs him by the arm and pushes him bodily into the shelter after Doyle. ,18300
Case pushes the door closed. ,617000
INT. SHELTER, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT They crouch inside the shelter as the organisms begin POUNDING at the walls, trying to force their way inside. ,28
It's going to be a long night. ,80700000
EXT. JUNGLE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT Ahead, Cooper can see the gleaming water of the inland sea, light still flickering in patches from the ice above it. ,16
COOPER This way. ,12600000
Brand begins to follow. ,540000
BRAND No... wait. ,16900000
Cooper forces his way between two writhing creatures, steps through, and falls... ,14400
EXT. WATERFALL -- NIGHT Cooper gasps as he surfaces from the ice-cold water. ,41400
Brand floats past. ,1830000
The river appears to flow randomly down the slope, with good reason -- the forest rearranges itself every night. ,305000
Ahead, the ground drops away again and the water rushes over it in a torrent. ,51300
Cooper catches himself at the last minute, grabbing a thick tree branch with one hand and, a second later, Brand with the other as she slides past. ,30900
COOPER I've got you. ,10000000
Suddenly, the branch in Cooper's hand illuminates and wrenches itself out of the rock -- it's a limb of a huge colony organism. ,3050
It shakes Cooper loose and they fall again... 86. ,23500
EXT. POOL -- NIGHT Brand surfaces first. ,7990000
She grabs Cooper and hauls him up and out of the water. ,2430000
She smiles down at him, a little smug. ,1470000
BRAND I've got you. ,11000000
Creatures begin splashing down into the pool behind them, as if imitating them. ,251000
Cooper stumbles to his feet and Brand guides them backward into a small cave carved into the rock above the pool. ,13700
INT. CAVE -- NIGHT Brand CRACKS a glow stick, basking the cave around them in a soft light. ,55600
As they watch, horrified, the pool and the rocks in front of the cave fill up with creatures of all sizes, as they tumble down the hill in what appears to be a battle royal. ,6940
For a moment, it looks like Brand and Cooper may go unnoticed. ,1550000
Then, a three-foot-tall creature with a dozen legs creeps its way toward the entrance to the cave. ,16400
Another follows, and another, until the cave entrance is full. ,4170000
Cooper looks around the cave, frantic. ,2150000
He picks up a rock. ,74000000
Brand, scared but still thinking, takes the rock from his hand and drops it back to the ground. ,574000
BRAND It's game theory. ,78800000
The best move is always to cooperate at first. ,50800000
COOPER By "cooperate" do you mean let it eat me? ,13800000
BRAND These organisms have no interest in us. ,8940000
They survive by photosynthesis. ,17100000
All they need is light. ,82400000
COOPER Then why are they killing each other? ,1110000
BRAND I don't know. (LOOKS AROUND) But we're outnumbered, Cooper. ,262000
So unless you have a better idea, I suggest we make nice. 87. ,1130000
The creatures move toward them hesitantly, then faster. ,672000
Cooper stands stock still as the creatures gather around him. ,59900
Several of them join up into bigger animals to get a better look at him. ,72800
One of them wraps itself around his chest and begins prodding at his shoulders, then his neck. ,101000
COOPER (trying to be calm) What is it doing? ,174000
BRAND It's a colony organism. ,2060000
It's trying to incorporate you into its structure. ,5540000
COOPER I don't want it to incorporate me. ,73100000
BRAND Don't open your mouth. ,57800000
COOPER WHY N- As he speaks, the creature on his chest extends four spindly, pointed feelers and reaches gently into his mouth. ,10800
Cooper holds his breath as the organism taps against his teeth. ,14500
Its skin has a roughened texture, as if incomplete, and it appears to be searching for the same texture on Cooper's skin, without much luck. ,14200
Bored, the life-forms climb back down off of Cooper. ,2470000
The last two creatures link up in an imitation of Cooper's lower body and attempt to walk across the room like a human. ,1670
After a moment, the creatures tumble to the ground and flail away. ,1720
Cooper is still breathing hard as the cave empties and he and Brand are left alone again. ,105000
Brand steps to the edge of the cave and watches, fascinated, as the creatures resume wrestling and battling each other. ,42100
COOPER (CONT'D) They're killing each other. ,291000
BRAND No. They don't bleed... they don't die... they're just competing... trying out different shapes, looking for the best one. 88. ,3920
Cooper watches as a hideously-awkward-looking, five-legged beast stumbles past and tackles another animal. ,222
COOPER I'd say they have a long way to go. ,19600000
BRAND (AMAZED) They do this every night. ,183000
As they watch, a two-foot-long creature with one huge claw scuttles along the ground, grabbing smaller opponents and smashing them apart, then sorting through the wreckage and adopting some of the writhing parts as its own. ,42
Something about the movement is endearing, the way it experiments with each piece -- less like a massacre and more like an over-caffeinated self-assembling erector set. ,1840
Suddenly, a massive, lumbering creature SMASHES down in front of the claw beast. ,318
No match, the smaller creature turns to scuttle away. ,18800
Too slow. ,1810000
The larger organism brings one club-like limb smashing down on top of it. ,10800
After a moment, it lifts its claw -- the two animals have become one. ,63200
The new organism lumbers away through the jungle, happily snapping its new claw at larger opponents. ,44
BRAND (CONT'D) The behavior changes as the animals get bigger and bigger. ,32500
More sophisticated. ,1030000
More calculated. ,90100
Two of the larger organisms square off, circling each other, lights pulsing up and down their bodies in a fierce display. ,1670
COOPER But what are they competing for? ,636000
BRAND I don't know. ,9240000
Brand shivers -- it's getting colder. ,74000
INT. CAVE -- NIGHT Brand and Cooper huddle around a small chemical fire they've brought with them. ,200000
Brand looks at the sample of the fractal wildlife in her case. ,203000
It's moving around, splitting apart, reforming, trying to find a way out. 89. ,833000
BRAND These creatures are billions of years older than we are. ,82800
But they're relatively primitive. ,3410000
They haven't developed tools, culture, language. ,3900000
COOPER Why not? ,12700000
BRAND I don't know. ,9240000
No one knows how intelligent life began on Earth. ,642000
But the surface of this planet has virtually no craters. ,104000
No impacts. ,736000
It's been sheltered by the local black holes. ,1440000
COOPER What difference would that make? ,5330000
BRAND Maybe not enough has gone wrong here. ,802000
Maybe bad luck is the key to intelligent life. ,57800
COOPER (QUIETLY) Murph's Law. ,206000
BRAND Exactly. ,101000
Maybe our interaction with them will push them over the top. ,2590000
Maybe that's part of the plan. ,19600000
COOPER (shakes his head) The plan. ,22300000
BRAND Why is it so hard for you to accept that someone might be trying to help us? ,69100
Cooper is silent for a moment. ,890000
His mood darkens. ,52000
COOPER I was in Denver during the first year of the famine. ,49300000
I was just a kid. ,1540000
We kept waiting for someone to come help us. ,4160000
People starved to death sitting on the ground, waiting for someone to come. (MORE) 90. ,811000
COOPER (CONT'D) (looks at her) I only made it because I realized that nobody was coming to save us. ,95900
We were on our own. ,1020000
Cooper looks away. ,13100000
The memories are never that far away. ,5510000
COOPER (CONT'D) Honestly? ,11200
After the things I saw... you want to know why I don't believe that someone would be trying to help us? ,1340000
Because I'm not sure we're worth saving. ,4970000
They sit in silence for a while. ,3960000
EXT. CAVE -- NIGHT Cooper sleeps. ,67200
After a moment, Brand steps back out into the darkness. ,123000
EXT. PLAIN -- DAWN Brand exhales great streams of frosted breath -- the temperature is well below freezing. ,19100
The first flickers of light are visible in the ice above. ,1610000
The creatures are huge now, forty or fifty feet tall, battling each other more and more slowly. ,33500
As Brand watches, the largest of them beats down his rivals, climbing to the top of the heap. ,31100
Just as the beast reaches the top, it freezes, as if stuck. ,56500
Above, the ice begins to shine brighter and brighter. ,123000
Suddenly, the beast on top breaks apart, unfurling into planes to catch the light. ,192000
This is what the contest has been about -- a better place in the sun. ,52400000
Brand takes it in. ,8980000
EXT. JUNGLE -- DAY Cooper and Brand pick their way their way through the foliage, which is now perfectly still, absorbing the light. ,16700
Cooper looks at the plants, wary. ,382000
Brand sees his trepidation and laughs at him. ,703000
BRAND They're not going to move now, Cooper. ,167000
They need to spread themselves as thin as they can to absorb the light. 91. ,832000
Cooper leads the way, pushing through the trees. ,176000
Suddenly he stops again. ,4170000
Brand, annoyed, pushes through the foliage to join him. ,40000
BRAND (CONT'D) Cooper, honestly, you're a bit of a- She stops. ,7550
Cooper is standing at a sheer cliff. ,130000
Spread out on the plain below is a massive, fortified base. ,53200
INT. CHINESE FORTIFIED COLONY -- DAY Massive blast doors, long since smashed in, open onto a building that has been overrun by the local fractal wildlife. ,2740
Case steps inside first, his worklights flickering on. ,22000
Cooper and the others follow him in. ,148000
INT. MESS HALL, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY The room is barely recognizable -- the fractal life has covered the tables and chairs. ,1160
Water pools on the floor and light streams in from a massive hole the fractal animals have punched in the ceiling. ,36100
DOYLE Looks like the Chinese picked a fight with the locals. ,167000
COOPER Looks like they lost. ,550000
They continue through the ruins. ,268000
INT. BARRACKS, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY The deeper they go, the less fractal wildlife they find. ,30700
The barracks are pristine -- hundreds of perfectly made beds, waiting for colonists who never came, like one of the bunkers the federal government used to keep in case of nuclear winter. ,3800
DOYLE Look at the size of this place. ,78900000
They built it for thousands of people. ,4490000
But no one came. ,94200000
Brand looks around, determined. ,11500000
BRAND They will. ,14800000
We can salvage it. ,1870000
This place will save us years. 92. ,77400000
COOPER But why didn't they come? ,90700000
BRAND (SHRUGS) The Chinese government collapsed, same as ours. ,12300
The people who knew about this mission probably died years ago. ,39100000
We had the same problems. ,78900000
Roth finds a sign he likes the look of -- it points to the science levels. ,349000
INT. LABORATORY, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY A massive door GRINDS open and the team steps into a massive complex of underground laboratories. ,71200
INT. DAMAGED LAB, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY Cooper and the others carefully make their way through a lab that has been completely emptied -- no desks, no chairs, nothing. ,10800
The only thing that remains is a solid ball of matter in the center of the room. ,724000
BRAND What happened here? ,31500000
Roth stares at the ball, intrigued. ,26600
ROTH They were testing something. ,188000
Cooper looks at the walls, which are bowed inwards. ,23500
COOPER Testing what? ,3770000
Roth is looking at the ball, which appears to have been built from layers of different material. ,99600
The outermost layer is flattened steel. ,32400
COOPER (CONT'D) (LOOKING CLOSER) Is that a chair? ,158000
Roth looks. ,3320
The outermost layer of the ball indeed looks like a steel chair, flattened with incredible force onto surface of the ball. ,1370
Brand opens the door to the next lab. 93. ,3170000
INT. LABORATORY, CHINESE COLONY -- NIGHT The lab is empty, except for a large metal sphere on a pedestal in the center of the room. ,2640
A black box is set into a cavity in the sphere, wired to a control panel. ,138000
Cooper looks at the walls of the room, which have been bowed inwards, as if some great force had been pulling from the center of the room. ,1770
COOPER Everything in here is bolted down. (looks at sphere) What do you think this thing does? ,6560
ROTH (EXCITED) Let's find out. ,117000
Roth finds a control panel. ,248000
Wipes off an inch of dust and begins tinkering with the controls. ,11000
COOPER I wouldn't turn it on until we can figure out what it does, Roth. ,387000
Roth continues to look over the controls, oblivious. ,1770000
BRAND (O.S.) Cooper. ,7790000
Come look at this. ,14800000
Brand calls out from the hallway. ,713000
INT. STAIRWELL, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY Cooper follows Brand's voice down the stairs to a sub-basement beneath the lab level. ,23800
INT. OBSERVATORY, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY Cooper steps into a huge space filled with a near perfect holographic representation of the local system. ,32300
Cooper joins Brand and Doyle in the map, looking at the incredibly detailed models of each star. ,95000
Case is standing at a terminal, hacking into the camp's records. ,252000
CASE I've found the Chinese mission logs. ,3420000
They're encrypted. ,4520000
Cooper walks over. ,13400000
COOPER Old military-grade encryption. ,84000
It's not very robust. (looks at Case) No offense. ,20300000
Hang on. ,8790000
Cooper punches a few keys into the terminal. ,126000
Opens up the terminal. ,95
Scans the motherboard. ,10600000
Takes Case's rifle and SMASHES one of the chips on the board. ,29800000
Cooper hands Case his rifle. ,1380000
COOPER (CONT'D) That should open up most of it. ,178000
Case is silent for a beat, parsing the information. ,1300000
CASE They got here twenty years ago. ,80100000
The human crew was killed by radiation the first day. ,2460000
But the robots survived. ,7090000
They built the colony and radioed home. ,1820000
But they didn't receive a response. ,97900
COOPER No one was listening. ,39400000
CASE (SCANS DOCUMENT) After a few years they discovered a problem. ,645000
DOYLE What problem? ,10700000
CASE It doesn't say. ,112000000
Their science team took the ship to continue exploring the system. ,644000
It says they found some kind of... (TRANSLATING) ...The word literally means 'treasure.' Case skims through the rest of the logs, large portions of which have been redacted. ,6160
CASE (CONT'D) The science team returned after five years with a new technology. ,523000
They began the experiments upstairs, then they left again and never returned. 95. ,292000
BRAND Where did they go? ,7130000
They've deleted their mission plan. ,2070000
There's nothing else. ,2090000
DOYLE I think I know what the problem is. ,1710000
Doyle is manipulating the time component of the map, slowing down the passage of time, reversing it, speeding it up. ,504000
DOYLE (CONT'D) Look. ,165000
Doyle speeds up the map until the ice planet is nearly a blur, speeding in its orbit around Pantagruel. ,583
DOYLE (CONT'D) There's a small black hole moving into the system. ,32600
Too small for us to have seen in our survey. ,1580000
It's not going to hit the planet, but it's going to come close. ,71200000
A tiny black hole soars through the system. ,1140000
Although it misses the ice planet, it deflects its orbit by a tiny degree. ,1270
After a dozen more orbits, the ice planet dips down close to Pantagruel's event horizon and is torn apart. ,370
Brand and the others watch as the sequence rewinds and repeats -- the planet is pieced back together again and ejected, then pulled back in and torn apart. ,7980
Over and over. ,6830000
DOYLE (CONT'D) This place isn't paradise. ,376000
It's doomed. ,570000
Just like us. ,1300000
The crew stand, watching the sequence in stunned silence. ,39600
COOPER How long does this place have? ,19200000
CASE A few years. ,12900000
A decade at most. ,3450000
Doyle turns to Brand. ,651000
DOYLE So much for the plan. ,758000
She is in disbelief, staring as a lifetime's training and optimism are torn to pieces. 96. ,5060
BRAND But I don't understand... why are we here? ,1280000
What are we here for? ,258000
Cooper looks down. ,12700000
Brand's upset is turning to anger. ,459000
BRAND (CONT'D) What the hell are we here for? ,68700000
I trained my whole life to reach this place. ,128000
She looks at Cooper, questioning. ,401000
COOPER (GENTLE) Maybe... maybe Roth's right... maybe we just don't understand it yet. ,7010
She looks down. ,2150000
She knows he doesn't believe what he's saying. ,4700000
He's been right all along -- they're alone. ,3830000
For a tiny moment, all hope is lost. ,195000
Suddenly, with a distant RUMBLE, the building begins SHAKING. COOPER (CONT'D) Case, what is that? ,52
CASE It's nighttime. ,1390000
The native life- forms are mobile again. ,24100000
The RUMBLE grows more intense, as if the entire building is being gently shaken. ,13300
COOPER No. It's closer than that. (REALIZING) Roth. ,50300000
The RUMBLE grows. ,10000000
As Cooper watches, Case's rifle slides free of the desk. ,90500
But instead of falling, it simply hangs in the air. ,123000
Then he realizes the same thing is happening to them -- his boots no longer have traction with the ground. ,214000
After a second everything in the room is floating an inch off of the ground. ,2410000
COOPER (CONT'D) Quick -- hold onto something. ,129000
He reaches out to Brand but it's too late -- suddenly they're no longer floating, they're falling. ,95900
They're falling up. 97. ,2720000
Cooper, Brand and the rest of them hit the ceiling. ,81700
Cooper picks himself up and adjusts to his surroundings -- up is now down. ,11200
He helps Brand up. ,2360000
DOYLE What the hell is happening? ,974000
Case doesn't answer -- he's looking up at the control equipment for the holographic display, which is GROANING under a load it was never built to handle. ,126000
Case grabs Cooper and Brand and pushes them towards the stairwell as the control panel TEARS free of the floor and CRASHES towards them. ,35900
Cooper falls into the stairwell -- now they're being pulled up and sideways through the stairwell, like an Escher painting. ,1210
Brand pushes Cooper out of the way as debris from the control panel orbits past them back up towards the lab. ,3780
They try to hang on but the force is becoming irresistible, dragging them along the wall of the stairwell and back towards the lab upstairs. ,2340
Brand wedges herself against the railing as objects and debris are SMASHING against the door to the lab. ,8140
Doyle is trying to hang onto the handrail but his grip slips and he CRIES OUT as he falls towards the door to the lab, SMASHING it open. ,2220
Doyle disappears up and into the lab. ,81900
Cooper slips trying to help Doyle. ,72300
Brand reaches out for him... ,1840000
Cooper is pulled through the open door. ,156000
INT. INTACT LAB, CHINESE COLONY -- NIGHT Cooper is pulled through the door and past the control panel. ,105000
He reaches out and grabs the underside of the panel. ,50600
He dangles, the panel cutting into the meat of his hand, trying to get his bearings: Roth, Doyle, and everything that hasn't been bolted down is either pressed against the sphere in the center of the room or is orbiting around it. ,587
Roth, who is laughing, jubilant, shouts up to him: ROTH The control panel is beneath you. ,16200
See if you can turn it off. 98. ,62900000
Cooper slips as he tries to reach the controls. ,500000
Finally he finds the controls for the machine. ,473000
COOPER (YELLS UP) I found it. ,48400
Hold onto something. ,74300000
Roth and Doyle crawl up the side of the mass and hold onto the support wires. ,35100
Cooper hits a key on the monitor. ,60400
Suddenly, the room inverts again, reverting to a normal gravitational field. ,12100
Cooper floats for a second, then topples back to the ground, along with everything else. ,64500
Brand stumbles in to find Cooper sprawled on the floor as Roth and Doyle hang onto the sphere for dear life. ,1680
INT. INTACT LAB, CHINESE COLONY -- NIGHT Roth, back on terra firma, is looking at the tiny black box he's pried from the center of the sphere. ,10800
Cooper is looking over his shoulder. ,3310000
COOPER They found a way to make gravity. ,3150000
ROTH Not make it. ,4210000
Adjust it. ,1350000
Dial it up, or down. ,6400000
I think they were experimenting with it -- firing these into the black hole to try to save this planet. ,353000
DOYLE All that from one tiny box. ,553000
Roth has hooked the box up to a terminal and it scrolling through the incredibly sophisticated machine code, trying to parse how it works. ,5980
Cooper looks on. ,12600000
ROTH (AMAZED) It barely uses any power. ,3280
I'm only beginning to understand what it does but I think it sends a signal out into the bulk. ,27500
It must tap into the same technologies that were used to create the wormholes in the first place. ,282000
COOPER What does that mean? 99. ,5180000
ROTH It means whoever built the wormhole probably doesn't exist inside our universe. ,3930
Cooper looks at the tiny box. ,2070000
COOPER But how did the Chinese develop the technology? ,303000
This would take decades, maybe hundreds of years, to create. ,73500
CASE Wherever they went, they found something that allowed them to build it. ,507000
Brand looks at the box. ,1500000
ROTH They came back here and tried to use these devices to save this planet. ,209000
But they didn't work. ,1520000
Nothing would be strong enough to weaken a black hole. ,19200000
BRAND Maybe we could work with it. ,44200000
Try to improve it. ,7790000
ROTH No. You're missing the bigger picture. ,345000
The robots had strict mission parameters. ,16800
They were told to build a colony and report back. ,936000
They tried to. ,1190000
But they failed. ,12000000
Like us they were fixated on this place. ,3860000
ROTH (CONT'D) They didn't realize they had already found something that would save us all. (holds up the box) This. ,1610
This is the prize. ,6910000
He holds up the box. ,66
ROTH (CONT'D) Don't you see? ,170000
Earth's gravity is like a prison. ,1050000
But this is like a master key. (MORE) 100. ,53900000
ROTH (CONT'D) If we could build more of these, we could turn down the earth's gravitational field enough to save millions of people. ,3930
We wouldn't have to pick a handful of people to survive. ,93100
With this we can save everyone. ,13500000
BRAND And go where? ,53900000
ROTH Wherever we want. ,7030000
We don't belong in any one place. ,1040000
Can't you see that now? ,1010000
Not Earth. ,134000
Not this place. ,22200000
If the human race is going to survive, we need to keep moving. ,44900
Split up. ,4230000
Spread out. ,2870000
Fly. ,18700000
With this, we can. ,5050000
Case looks at the box. ,1500000
Makes a decision. ,4220000
CASE In the morning we're taking this and going home. ,800000
Doyle, Roth and Case set about making preparations to leave -- gathering space suits, equipment. ,48300
In the bustle, Cooper finds Brand sitting alone, staring at the sample of fractal life. ,45800
COOPER I know this isn't exactly what you trained for. ,2380000
But I think Roth might be right. ,6890000
BRAND That doesn't help this planet. ,6150000
This creature is doomed. ,4510000
Unlike us it doesn't have anywhere to go. ,19500000
The fractal organism almost seems to be looking at her, trying to comprehend. ,12700
But it quickly loses interest and goes back to breaking itself into pieces and reforming into different shapes, trying to escape. ,14000
Brand sets it back down. ,345000
CUT TO: INT. BARRACKS, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY Morning. ,426000
Cooper and the others prepare to head out. ,1860000
They are laden down with gear -- space suits for the return trip to the lander once they reach the surface. 101. ,33800
Roth carries the gravitational prototype. ,12100
EXT. ENTRANCE, CHINESE FORTIFIED COLONY -- DAY They make their way through the ruined entrance. ,8670
CASE We need to hurry. ,3130000
We only have a few hours to reach the ice before nightfall. ,42600000
Cooper stops. ,5440
He puts a hand on Brand's shoulder. ,2730000
He points to the tree line. ,44600000
Something is moving. ,14000000
COOPER Don't make any sudden movements. ,1570000
They can't hurt us if we're unarmed. ,6130000
BRAND Who? ,215000
Suddenly, three ROBOT MARINES step out of the jungle, weapons raised. ,53700
They are wearing ghillie suits, pieced together from dried dead pieces of the local foliage. ,419
Under their camouflage, they looks identical to Case. ,1820000
With one key difference -- faded red and gold insignias. ,374000
Case steps protectively in front of his team. ,2980000
The CHINESE OFFICER steps forward, rifle levelled. ,591000
CHINESE OFFICER Ni Hao. ,462000
My name is Technical Sergeant Liu, 177th reconnaissance Marines, Army of the People's Republic. ,90800
Welcome to New China. (POLITE) Please put down your weapon. ,172000
Sergeant Liu speaks in the same even tones as Case -- they were probably built in the same factory before the war. ,33200
CUT TO: EXT. EARTH, 2320 -- DAY This is North America. ,3700000
But it doesn't look much like it. ,2410000
Mother Nature has just about wiped the slate clean. ,596000
Most of the vegetation is gone, and unchecked winds sweep across the barren plains. ,77600
Patches of ice lie think on the ground, as if a heavy snow has come and gone. ,439000
SUPER TITLE: "TWO HUNDRED YEARS LATER" One of the Chinese spaceships descends through the thick clouds above and settles gently onto the plain. ,4270
The hatch opens and Cooper steps out. ,28600
He takes a cautious look around. ,114000
He is holding the fractal life in its small container. ,940000
The clouds are threatening, but the weather looks calm enough right here. 144. ,1360000
Cooper starts to walk. ,3180000
EXT. COLLAPSED HOUSE -- DAY Remarkably, part of Cooper's old house is still standing. ,41200
INT. COLLAPSED HOUSE -- DAY Cooper stands in the middle of his kitchen. ,4770000
Two walls are missing and the rest is collapsed in a heap. ,1330000
But he can still see where he used to feed his kids breakfast. ,4770000
He has kept his promise. ,145000
Several hundred years too late. ,7130000
Cooper hunkers down, staring at the space where his kids used to be. ,1890000
Rainwater covers the ancient formica. ,19700
It has taken him years to finally reach this place. ,360000
He has had plenty of time to come to grips with what he might find. ,54300
But nothing has prepared him for this: He is completely alone. ,7380000
Nothing is left. ,300000
INT. COLLAPSED FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT Cooper is still sitting there when the ice storm hits. ,27500
Unchecked by trees or vegetation, the wind rockets through the house, blasting Cooper and pelting what's left of the structure with fist-sized hail. ,1710
Cooper takes shelter against the remaining wall. ,1510000
He's going to have to sit this one out -- the hail and winds are the brutal descendants of the weather he knew. ,45500
They'll finish him off if he steps back outside. ,2140000
As he watches, the pool of water on the kitchen floor freezes over in seconds. ,115000
INT. COLLAPSED FARMHOUSE -- DAWN Cooper shivers, pressed against the wall. ,12
The storm is still raging outside. ,596000
He is freezing to death. ,113000
He has to move now or he will die. ,91200000
He pulls the hood tight around his face and stumbles outside. ,84700
EXT. SNOWBOUND FIELD -- DAY Cooper makes his way through the blinding snow. ,29900
He tries to find his way, but the ship has been consumed by the blizzard. ,39600
He stumbles to the ground, dropping the glass case with the fractal wildlife in it. ,2290000
The case shatters. ,18600000
Cooper tries to stand back up, but his strength is dwindling. 145. ,448000
As he watches, the fractal wildlife creeps tentatively out of its broken habitat. ,12300
It forms together against the cold. ,97
After a moment, it burrows into the ice. ,215000
As it does, the ice glows faintly. ,64800
It seems to be right at home. ,391000
Cooper laughs, glimpsing the outline of a plan. ,11000000
Was this what the beings who made the wormhole intended all along? ,1940000
Cooper suddenly spots the outline of the ship through the driving snow. ,269000
He stumbles back up to his feet and struggles a few more steps, then stumbles again, spent. ,12600
Finally, he sits down in the snow to die. ,3260000
As his senses flicker in and out, he is struck with memories of his boys, so vivid he reaches out for them, crawling forward in the snow. ,10300
He stops, and laughs, remembering what Case told him about what happens when humans die. ,1430000
He struggles to his feet and stumbles a few more feet, eventually coming to rest just steps from the ship. ,50400
Cooper takes a final step. ,5570000
Finally, he collapses under his ship, as the wind continues to HOWL around him. ,35300
As the snow clears for a moment, Cooper is alone on a vast arctic tundra. ,52400
He will die alone. ,21600000
BLACK FADE IN: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY Cooper wakes. ,239000
He is in a sunlit room. ,22200000
A breeze rustles the curtains as it makes its way in through a large open window. ,10300
Cooper sits up. ,12700000
As he a does, a control panel on the wall TONES gently, as if in response to his movement. ,45300
He stands and looks around. ,3960000
He can see sunlight through the open windows and hear people -- kids YELLING as they play. ,1850000
He moves toward the window. ,1110000
Reaches for the curtains. ,6280000
Before he can, the door opens behind him. ,49500000
A WOMAN in a white coat steps in, smiling warmly. ,1450000
DOCTOR Good morning. ,4020000
Don't go outside just yet, Mr. Cooper. (MORE) 146. ,3030000
DOCTOR (CONT'D) (offers him a pill) This will help with the disorientation. ,15600
Cooper opens his mouth to talk, but his voice is cracked. ,86200
He gives up. ,26500000
Swallows the pill. ,9280000
DOCTOR (CONT'D) Wait a minute for that to take effect. ,80600
It can be a bit of an adjustment. (looks him over) You had some frostbite. ,1670000
Nothing too serious. ,2080000
As she talks, Cooper looks past her to the window. ,2600000
COOPER Where am I? ,7840000
DOCTOR (SMILES) It's a bit of a coincidence, really. ,700000
When the rangers found you, we were the nearest facility. ,216000
COOPER What's coincidence? ,2500000
What is this place? ,2720000
DOCTOR We have a lot to show you. ,82500000
The doctor reaches for the curtains. ,10800
She offers him a hand. ,23
Cooper declines the help and steps outside. ,181000
EXT. HOSPICE, COOPER STATION -- DAY Cooper is standing on a rooftop deck of a four-story building in a medium-sized city surrounded by fields. ,13
But as the road and the buildings stretch into the distance, the landscape curves up, not down. ,2530000
The entire landscape is contained within a huge cylinder- shaped space station. ,837000
Cooper stumbles, and reaches instinctively out. ,21600
The doctor catches him. ,827000
DOCTOR You're OK. We get this from people who move here from planetary colonies all the time. 147. ,96500
DOCTOR Like I said. ,80000000
It was a coincidence. ,3250000
There was a facility closer to Earth, but they had a problem, so you wound up here. (off his look) This is the Space Station Joseph A. ,30800
Cooper takes in the incredible surroundings. ,5180000
A thousand feet above them, black specks are sprinkled over an ocean of green -- Jersey milking cows grazing in a field of wild grass. ,12400
DOCTOR (CONT'D) I've got someone who wants to meet you. ,45400
Cooper looks at her. ,3470000
INT. INTENSIVE CARE ROOM, HOSPICE, COOPER STATION -- DAY Cooper steps inside. ,114000
The room is dark, still, the only noise is the labored RATTLE of an old man struggling to breathe. ,16700
Cooper steps closer to the bed. ,663000
The man's skin is paper- thin. ,133000
He is ancient. ,20900000
DOCTOR He was moved here after they found you. ,22500000
He's a little old for a transfer, but they made an exception. ,3380000
Cooper hovers at the back of the room, unsure. ,14200
He turns to the doctor, questioning. ,73500
Then he notices the pictures on the old man's desk: There are dozens of them. ,7600000
Children, grandchildren. ,321000
Then the older ones -- the man's own parents. ,29400
Grandparents. ,13500000
Cooper spots a tiny framed picture with someone he recognizes: Murph, 80 years old, surrounded by his daughter and her family. ,6700
They are standing in front of a re-opened Cape Canaveral, and a huge spaceship under construction. ,8680
Cooper picks up the picture and stares at it. ,37700
The doctor points to a shy little boy hiding behind Murph's leg in the picture. ,9270
DOCTOR (CONT'D) That's him. 148. ,247000
She points to the old man lying in the bed. ,10700000
DOCTOR (CONT'D) His name is Anthony Welling. ,72900
Anthony Cooper Welling. (SMILES) He's your great great grandson. ,93500
He's been waiting a long time for you. ,14400000
Cooper's eyes well with tears. ,458000
He steps over to the bed and looks down at the ancient man, teetering on the edge of death. ,411000
The old man looks at him, eyes widening in excitement. ,151000
He strains, trying to reach the bedside table. ,45000
He's trying to reach the drawer. ,105000
Cooper helps him open it. ,1050000
Inside is a simple, familiar wristwatch. ,279000
The old man carefully takes out the watch. ,4210000
He gives the watch a few winds and, hands shaking, offers it to Cooper. ,2480000
Cooper, eyes filling with tears, closes his hand over the old man's hand, enveloping both the watch and the man's hand. ,2260
CUT TO: EXT. CORNFIELD, COOPER STATION -- MORNING Cooper is sitting in a well-appointed office. ,68700
A middle-aged BUREAUCRAT smiles at him from the far side of a huge desk. ,13700
ADMINISTRATOR You're a hero, Mr. Cooper. ,600000
Let's just start off by saying that. ,2630000
It's an incredible and... unexpected honor to have you here with us. ,98000000
Cooper smiles, uncomfortable. ,561000
ADMINISTRATOR (CONT'D) None of us would be here without the efforts of you and the other crewmembers of the Endurance. (smiles, unconvincingly) So I don't want you to take this the wrong way. ,949
But there are some questions I've been told to ask. ,1690000
The man looks petrified, like he's been instructed to grill George Washington on his expense reports. ,5210
COOPER Shoot. 149. ,2120000
ADMINISTRATOR The rangers who found you reported that you had released a sample of an alien life-form into the wild. ,14100
Which is, unfortunately, against regulations. ,2110000
COOPER It was last of its kind. ,14600000
Their planet was destroyed. ,1300000
The administrator cues up a series of images on his computer. ,33600000
ADMINISTRATOR The rangers attempted to isolate the life-form, but it had already spread out of control. ,30600
It seems to be thriving. ,3620000
He shows Cooper a satellite image of north america. ,723000
A considerable portion of the frozen tundra is glowing. ,33100
Cooper begins laughing. ,1320000
Which makes the administrator even less comfortable. ,5700000
ADMINISTRATOR (CONT'D) Can you tell me why you... elected to release the life-form back on earth? ,71800
Cooper is still laughing. ,7890000
COOPER Because that was the plan. ,5230000
ADMINISTRATOR Whose plan? ,177000
COOPER (SMILES) I don't know. ,8550000
The administrator tries to smile back. ,438000
Makes a few notes in his file. ,6720000
Changes the subject. ,2240000
ADMINISTRATOR My assistant tells me you've applied for a position with the exploration fleet. ,17400
COOPER Feel like I should be pulling my weight. 150. ,5690000
ADMINISTRATOR That's admirable, Mr. Cooper. ,371000
The truth is, most of the fleet's personnel are automated. ,443000
There are a small number of crewed ships. ,114000
But there are great numbers of candidates. ,8170000
Very well trained candidates. ,13100000
COOPER I was hoping to enroll in a course. ,333000
Try to get myself up to speed on the new systems. ,822000
ADMINISTRATOR I don't want you to take this the wrong way, Mr. Cooper -- like I said, you're a hero. ,1180000
But the truth is we have somewhat limited resources. ,2870000
Cooper remembers this conversation. ,517000
He looks down. ,5750000
COOPER No one's heard anything from Brand? ,574000
ADMINISTRATOR I'm sorry. ,2660000
Officially, she's been listed as missing for over 200 years. ,828000
Mind you, I guess you turned up eventually, didn't you? ,3890000
COOPER Am I really going to hurt anybody by going to look for her? ,6940000
I just need a small ship. ,417000
I made a promise. ,295000
The bureaucrat looks down. ,683000
Is he really going to have to tell this guy the lay of the land? ,6990000
ADMINISTRATOR Listen. ,2340
You're a hero. ,65500000
You're the oldest man in the human race. ,3340000
Don't you want to take it easy? (off his look) I hope you understand, we all you hold you in the highest possible regard. (QUIET) Which is why they're never going to let you go off by yourself in a spaceship. ,91800
Cooper looks at his hands. ,3480000
He's got a couple centuries on the bureaucrat in Earth years, but looks ten years younger. ,20400
He puts his hands in his pockets. 151. ,2880000
ADMINISTRATOR (CONT'D) I've got some good news, however. (BIG SMILE) We all know about your early life, Mr Cooper. ,15800
I wrote a paper on it when I was a boy. ,15100000
And I think we found something you'll really enjoy. ,1130000
EXT. CORNFIELD, COOPER STATION -- DAY Corn blows in an artificial breeze. ,59400
A red tractor makes its way through the field, which curves gently up in the distance. ,15700
ADMINISTRATOR (V.O.) The machines do most of the work, of course, but we were able to get you a few acres. ,689000
You're going to be a farmer again. ,1870000
After a moment, the tractor stops. ,190000
Cooper climbs down from the seat. ,231000
Looks at the front steering linkage, which is jammed with an errant tree branch. ,340
He wipes his forehead and begins working the branch out of the machine. ,30000
He looks miserable. ,21000000
A robot, a similar unit to Tars, walks over. ,50500
Offers Cooper a bottle of water. ,924000
Cooper accepts it. ,12700000
EXT. HANGAR BAY, COOPER STATION Cooper stands on an observation deck, high above the hangar floor. ,1710
Below him, bright young things in uniforms climb into sleek-looking spaceships and prepare to set out. ,750
EXT. BASEBALL DIAMOND, COOPER STATION Cooper sits in the stands, listening to the familiar crack of the bat as an intramural team from the university practices. ,28
He looks bored. ,21800000
The kid up to bat cracks a pop fly. ,81700
For a second, the catcher shuffles back and forth, trying to get himself into position. ,11100
But the ball never returns. ,7660000
The catcher YELLS out a warning. ,21800
Above, the ball begins to slowly fall up, not down, toward the town center above. ,193000
After a second, the ball smashes through a skylight of a building high above them. ,34400
Cooper watches as the kid rounds the bases, laughing. 152. ,95900
INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE, COOPER STATION -- DAY Cooper's robot sits at the kitchen table. ,117000
Cooper is fiddling around in the back of his head. ,69000
ROBOT Settings: general settings, security SETTINGS-- COOPER Curiosity. ,1010000
New level setting. 100 percent. ,33000
ROBOT Confirmed. ,1780
Would you like to make any additional changes? ,73100000
COOPER Sense of humor. ,120000
New level setting. 100 percent. ,32500
Wait. (THINKS) 80 percent. ,76400
He begins putting the robot back together. ,157000
EXT. FARMHOUSE, COOPER STATION -- TWILIGHT Cooper sits on his porch, joined by the same robot as before. ,15100
They watch as the space station rotates lazily out of alignment with the local star, casting the inside of the cylinder into shade, then darkness. ,1000
The shadow races past them. ,56500
Another day. ,10800000
Another night. ,928000
EXT. HANGAR, COOPER STATION A maintenance worker finishes looking over one of the sleek- looking spacecraft. ,30400
He packs up his tools and heads out. ,3410000
After a moment, two figures pick their way across the hangar floor, sticking to the shadows. ,28700
As they reach the first ship in the line, we get a better look. ,47400000
It's Cooper and his robot pal. ,840000
The robot is wearing a baseball cap and carrying a toolbox. ,78000
Cooper gestures to the robot, who sets down the toolbox with a click against the mirror-like floor. ,108000
Cooper shakes his head, annoyed, at the robot, and puts his finger to his lips. ,19000
The robot nods, bashful. ,85500
Cooper waves a small handheld computer near the skin of the ship until it lights up. ,35800
Then he punches in a few codes. ,32500
He punches in a few more. 153. ,23900
Suddenly, the hatch opens with a HISS. INT. SHIP Cooper moves quickly to the cockpit of the ship. ,48700
Looks over the controls. ,4030000
The robot straps himself in next to him. ,5470000
Cooper looks up through the windows. ,7590000
The inky black void of space beckons. ,2880000
Cooper smiles and reaches for the controls. ,159000
COOPER Where do you want to go first? ,157000000
The robot thinks it over. ,1000000
EXT. HANGAR, COOPER STATION The technician walks back into the hangar. ,19300
He walks along the row of ships till he reaches the last one. ,23100
It's not there. ,25700000
He looks out into the blackness of the void. ,62400
Sees a tiny glowing speck, getting smaller and smaller. ,14600
BIRDMAN Written by Alejandro G. ,81300
Inarritu Nicolas Giacobone Alexander Dinelaris, Jr. Armando Bo 1 BLACK 1 We hear a clock ticking. ,6970
FADE IN: 1 INT. RIGGAN'S DRESSING ROOM - THEATER - DAY 1 Close on the brilliant colors of a middle eastern rug, the center of what seems to be a makeshift "meditation" space. ,2860000
We slowly tilt up to discover the back of Riggan Thomson (55). ,11700
He is in the proper `Lotus' position, dressed only in tight white briefs and he appears to be meditating deeply. ,11800
And if all this seems a little odd, it becomes all the more so when you notice that he is levitating almost two feet above the floor. ,127000
His breath is calm and measured... in and out... in and out. ,1760000
MAN (V.O.) How did we end up here? (Beat.) This place is a fucking dump. ,38100
We begin to slowly move toward Riggan's back while his measure breathing continues. ,16400
We see a clock on the wall, ticking. ,5980000
MAN (V.O.) Smells like balls. ,35300
A slight twitch in Riggan's neck. ,408000
MAN (V.O.) We don't belong in this shithole. ,7640000
A Skype call shatters the silence. ,588000
Close on his back, we follow Riggan as he walks over to the computer and answers the call. ,145000
On the computer screen appears Sam (21), in a pair of Levi's and a Led Zeppelin T-shirt. ,15000
She has simple and striking good looks, with an edge in her voice and behind her eyes. ,500000
She stands in a Korean Deli among the flowers, talking to Riggan through her iPhone. 1A 1A The Korean Store owner (50) stands in the background screaming at her the whole time. ,3
RIGGAN Sam, I can't-- (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 2. ,22200
SAM Dad? ,7970
What kind of-- (Turning to Korean.) SHUT UP!!! (Back to screen.) What kind of flowers did you say you wanted? ,170000
RIGGAN Alchemillas. ,25
Or something soothing that smells nice. ,1860000
Listen I can't-- SAM It all smells like fucking Kimchi! RIGGAN Then whatever looks nice. ,3790
Anything but roses. ,12900000
No roses. ,99500
KOREAN Flowers don't need you touch! They need you buy!!! SAM (Close into the screen.) I hate this job. ,167000
And the Skype call is over. ,4100000
Riggan closes the laptop and leans forward trying to regain his calm. ,13100
His reflection appears in the mirror, and for the first time we see his face. ,1490000
He has a dark goatee and his hair looks strangely abundant. ,11700000
There is a piece of paper on the mirror with the handwritten phrase "A thing is a thing, not what it is said of that thing." ANNIE ON SPEAKERS Riggan, they're starting scene five. ,1150
We need you on stage. ,101000000
RIGGAN Shit... ,6
Riggan throws on a sweater and stumbles into his slacks. ,755000
He hurries out... 2 INT. HALLWAYS - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 2 ...through the narrow corridors of the theater. ,4920
There is a lot of activity as various workers and stage hands appear and disappear carrying equipment and scenery. ,143000
As Riggan descends the stairs, a Stage Hand· passes by in the opposite direction. ,4210
STAGE HAND· Mr. Thomson. (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 3. ,232000
RIGGAN Steve. ,796
STAGE HAND· It's Daniel. ,10
RIGGAN (Already passed.) Okay. ,1380000
Riggan continues on until he arrives backstage. ,783000
He runs into Jake (42) his producer and friend. ,1080000
JAKE How's it going, buddy. ,6620000
RIGGAN Great. ,6100
It'd be even better if I could get Ralph to stop acting like he's in an educational video for syphilis... ,17000
The camera moves off of them and onto... 3 INT. STAGE - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 3 ...the stage. ,1040000
Suddenly we are in the midst of an Americana style kitchen. ,223000
Around the kitchen table sit Lesley (35), plain and no nonsense, her simple hairstyle and makeup can't hide how attractive she is. ,23300
Laura (35), dark, exotic, the kind of woman who makes every person she meets feel like she's seducing them. ,46000
And Ralph (40), slightly handsome, slightly balding, slightly invisible. ,5040
A half empty bottle of gin on the table, they drink from highball glasses as they chat... ,60900
LESLEY He loved me. ,42700
RALPH Yeah. ,3030
He loved her so much he tried to kill her. ,2280000
LAURA He tried to kill you? ,199000
LESLEY No. (A beat.) Okay, well, he did beat me up one night. ,8340000
He dragged me around the living room by my ankles, yelling "I love you, I love (MORE) (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 4. ,178000
LESLEY (CONT'D) you, bitch." What do you do with a love like that? ,108000000
RALPH How is that-- That is not love and you know it. ,70900000
Why do you insist on calling it-- LESLEY You can say what you want, but I know what it was. ,1420000
RALPH What about you, Nick? ,30900000
Does that sound like love to you? ,1120000
Riggan arrives at the table and sits. ,2260000
RIGGAN Sorry I'm late. (Beat. ,57
In character.) I'm the wrong person to ask. ,415000
I didn't know the man. ,5990000
I've only heard his name mentioned in passing. ,12900000
You'd have to know the particulars. ,1920000
But I think what you're saying is that love is absolute. ,2950000
RALPH Yeah. ,2950
The kind of love I'm talking about is... ,268000
The kind of love I'm talking about, you don't try and kill people. ,14400000
LESLEY (Sadly.) It was love, Mel. ,17100
To Eddie, it was. ,3
I don't care what anybody says. ,22500000
He was ready to die for it. ,198000
RALPH Ask her what he did after she left him. ,8690000
LESLEY He shot himself in the mouth. ,485000
But he screwed that up, too. ,2410000
Poor Ed. RALPH Poor Ed, my ass. ,1540000
The guy was dangerous. ,15200000
LAURA How'd he screw it up if he shot himself in the mouth? ,107000
RALPH (By the numbers.) He used to carry this twenty-two. ,217000
We lived like fugitives those days. ,2450000
I never knew-- (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 5. ,566000
RIGGAN (Breaking character to direct. ,4860000
Exasperated.) Okay. ,3730
Fugitives are on the run, Ralph. ,457000
How many times do I have to-- Fugitives are scared. ,3390000
Give me more of that. ,100000000
Ralph nods. ,1240
He takes a breath and dives in once again... ,97100
RALPH (The same but louder.) We lived like fugitives those days... ,56900
Extremely frustrated, Riggan stares out into the auditorium. ,4550
From his POV we see Jake who is now sitting in the third row. ,1610000
His head buried in his hands, tortured by Ralph's performance. ,125000
Riggan turns back to Ralph. ,13300
RALPH (CONT'D) ...I never knew if he was going to come out of the bushes or from behind a car and just start shooting. ,35700
Riggan watches Ralph act and sees his whole production headed down the drain. ,70100
Ralph is just that bad. ,12600000
RALPH (CONT'D) The man was crazy. ,54600
He was capable of anything. ,331000
The actors all wait for a cue from Riggan, who is now staring up into the lights above the stage. ,10500
Laura finally picks up Riggan's cue. ,57900
LAURA Christ. ,4770
What a nightmare... ,10400000
RALPH He used to call me at the hospital and say... (Over the top.) "Son of a bitch. ,170000
Your days are numbered." Silence. ,2460000
Ralph looks over to Riggan. ,425000
RALPH (CONT'D) Too much? ,64000
Little bit? ,13800000
I just wanted to give you a range, so you could-- And with that a light comes barreling down from it's perch and crashes into Ralph's head, making him hit the floor like a rag doll. ,958
LAURA Holy shit. (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 6. ,310000
Lesley and Annie (35), the Stage Manager, run over to Ralph who is out cold. ,48100
Not knowing what to do, they stare at him. ,2440000
LESLEY Is he breathing? ,6300000
Jake runs toward the stage. ,2240000
JAKE Someone call 911! Riggan slowly backs away from the chaos. ,19500
LAURA Is that blood coming out of his ear? ,3500000
JAKE (To Riggan.) Where are you going? ,44800
LESLEY Okay, he's breathing. ,19900
What did he have for lunch? ,73000000
LAURA Did anyone call for help? ,5420000
ANNIE (Clapping.) Wake up! Wake up! Two crew members try to help Ralph. ,42100
CREW MEMBER Grab his legs. ,560000
I got the top. ,54400000
JAKE Don't move him! Wait for the ambulance. (Calling out.) For the love of God! I could get a black audience in this theater faster than a doctor! Riggan heads off the stage, and Jake chases after him. ,714
We follow them as... 4 INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 4 ...they walk through the corridor. ,216000
JAKE Where are you going? ,559000
We'll have the understudy ready to rehearse in five-- (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 7. ,45700
RIGGAN Forget the understudy. ,39600
We have to postpone the preview. ,10900000
JAKE What are you-- It's a full house. ,142000
We would have to refund all the-- RIGGAN Then do it. ,5650000
A crew member· passes in the opposite direction. ,177000
CREW MEMBER· How's Ralph? ,164000
RIGGAN He'll be fine. ,483000
JAKE Wait. ,90900
RIGGAN Listen to me. ,7490000
It was going to be a disaster. ,6210000
That guy's the worst actor I've ever seen. ,604000
The blood coming out of his ear was the most honest thing he's done so far. ,1510000
JAKE He's not that bad. ,9660000
Riggan stops in his tracks and stares at Jake. ,7310
JAKE (CONT'D) Okay, he's fucking horrible. ,158000
But-- Riggan starts walking again. ,25
JAKE (CONT'D) You have the press in your dressing room in a few hours. ,156000
How are we-- RIGGAN I'll make something up. ,52400000
Two Technicians· hurry up in the opposite direction. ,180000
RIGGAN (CONT'D) Jake. ,55
This happened for a reason. ,1260000
It wasn't an accident. ,103000
JAKE What do you mean? (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 8. ,18200000
RIGGAN I-- (A beat.) I made it happen. ,14000
JAKE Oh. Okay. (Beat.) Are you drunk? ,97700
RIGGAN Find me an actor. ,137000
A good actor. ,18100000
Philip Seymour Hoffman... ,11800000
JAKE He's doing the third Hunger Games. ,807000
RIGGAN Michael Fassbender? ,1350000
JAKE Doing the prequel to the X-Men prequel. ,138000
They arrive at Riggan's dressing room. ,78400
RIGGAN What's his name? ,70100000
Jeremy Renner... ,1010000
JAKE Who? ,87800
RIGGAN The... the Hurt Locker guy. ,1890
JAKE Yeah. ,9840
He's an Avenger. ,10200000
RIGGAN (With disgust.) Fuck. ,62600
They put him in a cape, too? (A beat.) Look, I don't care. ,2720000
Find me someone. ,190000
Riggan enters... 5 INT. RIGGAN'S DRESSING ROOM - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 5 ...his dressing room and tries to shut the door. ,467
Jake, still in the corridor, stops it with his foot. ,1840000
JAKE (Sticking his head in.) Ralph'll sue us. ,284000
He'll sue us. ,944000
And he's got a case. (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 9. ,261000
Riggan releases the door. ,11300000
RIGGAN Then make him go away. ,4250000
JAKE How do you suggest I do that? ,9
RIGGAN You're my lawyer, my producer and my oldest friend. ,3000000
We are going to make this work. ,8
Now just get out there and do what you were born to do. ,9570000
JAKE What's that? ,7000000
RIGGAN I have no idea. ,423000
But I have faith. ,7540000
Now go away from me. ,840000
JAKE Do you think we should-- Riggan slams the door shut on Jake. ,20200
On a television, a segment of E! News. ,170000
A busty blond, with an exaggerated smile, hosts. ,12300
BLOND WOMAN ...and when we come back, an exclusive interview with Robert Downey Jr., who tells us about the billion-dollar Iron Man franchise. ,30900
The talented actor invited us onto the set of Iron Man 3... ,55300
Riggan slams the tv off, his mind racing. ,29100000
He sits on a chair. ,4770000
MAN (V.O.) That clown doesn't have half your talent and he's making a fortune in that Tin Man get up. ,250000
Riggan stares into the mirror, in the reflection he catches sight of a poster from a movie called "Birdman 3". ,2680000
The superhero, Birdman (a younger Riggan in a bird costume), wings widely spread, stares directly back at him. ,42200
A hand written note on the top of the poster reads: "Thomson, break a wing! From the boys at Local 1." Riggan tries to calm himself with a mantra... ,7240
RIGGAN "Breathing in, I embrace my anger. ,1170000
Breathing out, I smile to it." (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 10. ,1070000
BIRDMAN (V.O.) Embrace it. ,37700
Kiss it. ,735000
Turn it around and fuck it in the-- A knock on the door behind him. ,191000
RIGGAN Not now! Laura opens the door and sticks her head in. ,10100
LAURA Can I come in? ,553000
RIGGAN No. LAURA Okay. ,1500000
Two words. ,8630000
Shia La Beouf. ,2600000
RIGGAN That's three words. ,58700
LAURA It's two. ,16200000
RIGGAN Get out. ,121000
Riggan tries to calm himself down, but Laura opens the door again. ,61700
LAURA (CONT'D) I take it we're not going to dinner anymore? ,102000
RIGGAN I don't have an actor. ,115000000
LAURA I don't have a life. ,45700000
RIGGAN Laura... ,779
LAURA Fine. ,16800
Whatever. (Goes to leave but stops.) You remember at Joan's when you asked me to come do a Broadway play with you? ,28800
You said it would be fun... (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 11. ,54600000
RIGGAN Go away. ,2
LAURA So far? ,6000
No fun. ,1190000
Riggan closes the door and looks at the Birdman poster. ,203000
BIRDMAN (V.O.) Fun? ,521000
You know what would be fun? ,8690000
Getting the fuck out of here before we humiliate ourselves. ,411000
That would be fun. ,454000
Riggan looks at himself in the mirror and begins to pull at his hair. ,93600
As it comes off his head, we discover it was a wig. ,17400000
He turns away from the mirror, trying desperately to stay calm. ,685000
Something catches his eye: a vase of roses on the end of the table. ,332000
A card in them says, "They didn't have the whatever you wanted - Sam". ,402000
Enraged, Riggan focuses on the vase. ,12100
It begins to shift. ,526000
Then, with a surge of anger, without ever touching it, he sends it crashing against the wall on the other side of the room. ,6830
The camera pans over the roses scattered across the floor. ,149000
It hovers over the carpet and around the perimeter of the room, until it finally settles on Riggan, now dressed in a casual blazer. ,49000
A5 A5 It is later the same day. ,5840000
He is sitting on the sofa and on three chairs in front of him are three journalists: Gabriel, a geeky theatre journalist, wearing thick glasses and a thin tie. ,1100
Clara, a reporter from an entertainment blog. ,639000
And Han, a polite, obese Japanese journalist, who sits next to his translator, another Japanese guy. ,67
GABRIEL Why does somebody go from playing the lead in a comic book franchise to adapting Raymond Carver for the stage? ,46700
Riggan tries to remain calm. ,318000
GABRIEL (CONT'D) I mean, as you're probably aware, Barthes said, "The cultural work done in the past by gods and epic sagas is now done by laundry detergent commercials and comic strip characters." It's a big leap you've taken... ,19
Riggan shifts nervously. (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 12. ,890
RIGGAN Well... ,56
Absolutely. ,15400000
As you said... that Barthes said... ,56300
Birdman, like Icarus... ,1630000
CLARA Hang on. ,492000
Who's this Barthes guy? ,699000
Which Birdman was he in? ,5750000
GABRIEL Roland Barthes was a French philosopher, who-- CLARA Oh. Okay. ,23500
Now, is it true you've been injecting yourself with semen from baby pigs? ,36000
RIGGAN What? ,520
CLARA As a method of facial rejuvenation. ,105000
RIGGAN Who told you that? ,8010
CLARA It was tweeted by... (checks her notes) @prostatewhispers. ,11
RIGGAN It's a lie. ,19700
CLARA I know. ,11700000
But did you do it? ,16
RIGGAN No! GABRIEL Are you afraid at all that people will say you're doing this play to battle the impression that you're a washed-up super hero? ,16900
RIGGAN No. I'm not. ,38400
And that's exactly why 20 years ago I refused to do Birdman 4. ,165000
HAN Birdman 4??? ,137000
You do Birdman 4??? ,2680000
Jake opens the door and the camera pans to him. (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 13. ,103000
JAKE Okay. ,4200
That's enough for today. ,331000
We're expecting some great pieces from you... ,346000
Riggan stares at the Birdman poster. ,773
JAKE (CONT'D) Publicity guys are trying to get you a Times feature. ,126000
Riggan stands up and pulls the Birdman poster off of the wall. ,544000
JAKE (CONT'D) So, How'd it-- Whoa. ,515000
If I were you I wouldn't do that. ,140000000
RIGGAN I don't want to look at it anymore. ,21400000
JAKE That was a present from the crew. ,2850000
Don't fuck with those guys, they're union. ,1040000
RIGGAN I don't care. ,999000
Riggan leaves the poster on the floor, facing the wall, and walks to the window. ,125000
He opens it. ,21100000
We can hear distant drums coming from the street. ,977000
JAKE So... ,31000
RIGGAN Great. ,6100
JAKE (Worried.) Did they ask about Ralph? ,4790000
RIGGAN Nope. ,5
JAKE Good. ,21000
He did it, you know? ,72900000
The motherfucker threatened to sue us. ,30200
Didn't even wait to get out of the hospital. ,12900000
RIGGAN And, what did you say? (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 14. ,62300000
JAKE What'd I say? ,4310000
I said, "You motherfucker. ,6940000
You're threatening me? ,2800000
ME? I swear to god, you fuck, I so much as get a letter from a lawyer, the press'll get the pictures we got off your computer." RIGGAN What pictures? ,92800
JAKE The guy has a thing for nuns... in diapers. ,617000
What do you care? ,3050000
You shouldn't have any knowledge about it anyway. ,6280000
The important thing is that I made him go away. ,114000
RIGGAN Right. ,546
JAKE Yeah, it's fantastic. ,3950000
One problem. ,1080000
We don't have an actor. ,115000000
And if we cancel the first preview the press will smell the blood. ,2920000
We can't afford to lose any more money. ,2910000
At all. ,15900000
RIGGAN What do you want me to do? ,114000000
JAKE We pay an understudy, let's use the understudy. ,267000
RIGGAN No. JAKE No? Riggan, listen to me. ,1170000
Our dream actor is not going to knock on that door and say: "Hey fellas, when do we start?" B5 B5 There is a knock at the door. ,1850
Leslie peeks in. ,3430000
LESLIE Can I talk to you for a second? ,19400000
RIGGAN Yeah. ,298
What's up? (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 15. ,2
LESLIE Did you find another actor? ,20000000
RIGGAN No. LESLIE Okay. ,143000
Mike's available. ,2070000
RIGGAN He is? ,23500000
JAKE Mike who? ,15000000
RIGGAN I thought he was doing-- LESLIE He was. ,894000
He quit. ,502000
Or got fired. ,123000
JAKE Mike who? ,15000000
RIGGAN Which one? ,32700000
Quit or fired? ,11300000
LESLIE With Mike it's usually both. ,1260000
JAKE Mike Fucking Who? ,15
LESLIE Shiner. ,2440
JAKE Yes! RIGGAN Jake... ,29400
JAKE Yes! How do you know Mike Shiner? ,479000
LESLIE We share a vagina. ,77200
RIGGAN You think he'd want to do it? ,1250000
LESLIE Yeah. (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 16. ,2990000
JAKE How do you know? ,49700000
LESLIE Because he said he'd want to do it. ,84000000
JAKE Yes! RIGGAN Jake. ,29400
Hang on a minute. ,7820000
JAKE (to Riggan) Ask me if he sells tickets. ,539000
RIGGAN Does he sell tickets? ,10100
JAKE A shitload of tickets. ,11600
Now ask me if the critics like him? ,1890000
RIGGAN Do they like him? ,483000
JAKE They want to spooge on him. ,49700
RIGGAN (Indicating Lesley.) Hey. ,578000
JAKE Leslie... ,6060
LESLIE Right on his face. ,3730000
JAKE Everything for a reason, right? ,340000
RIGGAN You think he'll be able to come tonight? ,25100
LESLEY I can call him and find out. ,8870000
Riggan gives Jake a look. ,10000000
JAKE I'll call his agent. ,82200
Jake charges out of the room. ,1160000
The camera follows him into... 10/29/14 / 17. 6 INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 6 ...the hallway and as Jake makes a left turn, Annie enters from the right. ,516
JAKE Annie, turn the work lights on and get me a fresh copy of the script. ,1060000
We're gonna have a "put in" tonight. ,42800000
ANNIE Who? ,87000
JAKE You'll find out... ,605000
Jake disappears down the hall and we follow Annie through the theater and onto... 7 INT. STAGE - THEATER - EVENING 7 ...the stage, where she turns some of the stage work lights on. ,27
We pan along the stage until we find Riggan, wearing the same clothes as before, scanning the empty auditorium. ,10200
MIKE (O.S.) Intimidating. ,3840000
Isn't it? ,5300000
Riggan sees Mike Shiner (39) coming down the aisle, slovenly dressed with mussed hair and intense eyes. ,11
MIKE (CONT'D) Do you have any idea who walked these boards before you? (Beat.) Geraldine Page, Marlon Brando, Helen Hayes, Jason Robards... ,75
And now you. ,274000000
Riggan Thomson. ,36300
Riggan, trying to hide the intimidation. ,2730000
RIGGAN Thanks for coming on such short notice, Mike. ,6190000
I appreciate it. ,11700000
MIKE Hey. ,31300
This is what we do. (Indicates a script.) So, you wrote this adaptation? ,496000
RIGGAN I did. (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 18. ,34600000
MIKE And you're directing the adaptation and starring... ,1110000
RIGGAN I am. ,27300000
MIKE Ambitious. ,90
RIGGAN Thank you. ,24200000
A sly smile from Mike. ,460000
He leaps onto the stage. ,52300
MIKE Why don't we do a bit of it? ,88300000
RIGGAN Hey, I wasn't expecting you to-- MIKE First preview is tomorrow, right? ,127000
RIGGAN Yeah, but you can go on with the script until you feel comfortable-- MIKE Let's just do some of it. ,54900000
Riggan tries to hide his excitement. ,2180
He grabs the script from a nearby table and walks it over to Mike. ,501000
RIGGAN Take a look at page twenty-- MIKE Yeah. ,384000
I don't need that. ,1800000
RIGGAN What? ,520
MIKE I don't need the script. ,18200000
Just give me a cue. ,2010000
RIGGAN What are you talking about? ,27900000
MIKE Feed me a line. ,148000
RIGGAN I don't-- What? (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 19. ,84500
MIKE Feed. ,5020
Me. A line. ,26700000
Riggan drops the script and begins the scene. ,179000
RIGGAN "I'm the wrong person to ask. ,7280000
I didn't know the man. ,5990000
I've only heard his name mentioned in passing. ,13500000
I wouldn't know. ,2040000
You'd have to know the particulars. ,1920000
But I think what you're saying is that love is absolute." Mike stares at Riggan, hyper-focused. ,12900
MIKE (Ruminating.) Am I saying that love is absolute? (He transforms.) "Yeah. ,3230000
The kind of love I'm talking about is. ,268000
The kind of love I'm talking about you-- " (An intense pause.) Well, you don't try to kill people. ,1840000
Riggan is transfixed, and almost immediately intimidated. ,26
RIGGAN How do you know the lines? ,621000
MIKE I have a thing, a whatever, a gift. (A beat.) Come on, I helped Lesley get off book. ,149000
Hey, give me that cue again. ,575000
RIGGAN "I'm the wrong person to ask. ,7280000
I didn't know the man. ,5990000
I've only heard his name mentioned in passing. ,13500000
I wouldn't know. ,2040000
You'd have to know the particulars. ,1920000
But I think what you're saying is--" MIKE Okay, can I-- Do you mind if I-- RIGGAN No, go ahead. ,612000
MIKE Follow me. ,30600000
He says, "I'm the wrong person to ask." What's his intention? ,3600000
Is he fed up with the topic? ,2250000
Deflecting? ,567000
Guilt about his wife maybe? ,956000
Then four sentences all say the same thing... "I didn't even know the man." (MORE) (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 20. ,2760000
MIKE (CONT'D) "I've only heard his name mentioned in passing." "I wouldn't know." "You'd have to know the particulars." First of all, particulars? ,2620
What are you, my grandmother? ,24600000
But the point is, YOU DON'T KNOW THE GUY, WE FUCKING GET IT. Make it one line. "I didn't even know the guy." Right? ... ,927000
RIGGAN You pretty much know my lines too, huh? ,78000000
MIKE Can we-- Are we doing something here? ,7460000
Come on let's go. ,16100000
Cut it down, give it to me again. ,1620000
RIGGAN "I'm the wrong person to ask--" MIKE Oh, right, sorry, you see? "I'm the wrong person to ask?" That's another fuck you. "Don't put me on the spot. ,2320000
Don't make me self conscious about my marriage when my wife is sitting right here..." See? ,256000
Give it to me. ,20700000
RIGGAN Okay, let me-- MIKE Come on. ,48300000
Give it to me right now. ,1800000
Fuck me. ,12500000
Right now. ,18000000
Let's do it. ,6200000
RIGGAN Okay, yeah... ,16600000
MIKE DO IT! RIGGAN (Jumps in w/out thinking.) "Hey. ,5540000
I'm the wrong person to ask, okay? ,2490000
I didn't even know the guy. ,6400000
So what's your point?" MIKE "What's my point?" RIGGAN "What's your point? ,30800000
What are you saying? ,41000000
Spit it out. ,10200000
You're saying, what? ,1130000
That love is an absolute?" (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 21. ,1000000
MIKE (Exploding.) "Yeah! Alright? ,4170000
The kind of love I'm talking about is absolute. ,25100000
The kind of love I'm talking about you-- (A painful memory.) Well, you don't try to kill people. ,2020000
Riggan stands silently, his heart pounding. ,483000
MIKE (CONT'D) So what do you think, boss? ,185000
Do I have a job? ,102000000
Riggan calls over to the wings. ,22100
RIGGAN What do you think? ,19500000
Mike turns to see Sam, who has been there for a bit. ,1030000
SAM Larry needs to see him for a fitting. ,136000
MIKE I'm gonna take that as a yes. (Walking to Sam.) And you are...? ,267000
RIGGAN That's my daughter, Sam. ,41300
MIKE Right. ,23000
I can see it around the... (A beat) She doesn't look anything like you. (To Sam.) And your job is...? ,2060000
RIGGAN She's my assistant. ,8040000
MIKE Your assistant... (To Sam.) And can you speak? ,5660000
SAM Yup. ,3710
I can even 'sit', 'stay' or 'roll over' if you have any treats. ,816000
RIGGAN Welcome aboard, Mike. (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 22. ,10200
MIKE (Mock saluting.) Thank you, Captain. ,541000
We follow Mike and Sam off as they... 8 INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 8 ...advance through the hallways. ,32500
MIKE I'm Mike Shiner, by the way. ,5660000
SAM I know who you are. (Reluctantly honest.) I saw you in 'Hothouse' at the Geffen. ,12200
It was... great. ,4030000
MIKE That ass is great. ,40000
She turns her head toward him with a disgusted expression. ,89300
SAM Dude. ,5630
Seriously? ,14400000
Moving by her, into a dressing room. ,50800000
MIKE This is the theatre, honey. ,329000
Don't be so self-conscious. ,78000000
She follows him into the room where we see... 9 INT. COSTUME DEPARTMENT - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 9 ...Larry stressing out while he works on a costume. ,590
He turns to see Mike standing there. ,257000
Sam stands against the wall, focused on her cell phone. ,233000
LARRY Oh, thank the Lord and pass the biscuits! I finally have an actor to dress. ,44000
Hello, Mr. Shiner. ,141000
MIKE How're you doing, Larry? ,586000
LARRY Better, now that you're here. ,85000000
Take off your clothes. (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 23. ,2290000
Mike takes off his shirt and hands it to Sam. ,1560000
She doesn't budge, and it hits the floor. ,25300
He begins to unbutton his pants... ,19100
MIKE You gonna stand there? ,162000
SAM (Glancing at her cell.) This is the theatre, honey. ,478000
Don't be so self-conscious. ,78100000
Larry searches for a few costume pieces. ,1010000
LARRY Okay. ,3040
I'm gonna have to start from scratch, with less than twenty-four hours... ,6510000
Let's see if these-- He turns to see a completely naked Mike. ,1160000
LARRY (CONT'D) Holy-- What is happening? ,40800
Where are your underpants? ,25900000
MIKE At home, under the bed, I think. ,83000
Sam glances at Mike for a second, then returns to her phone. ,8710000
Larry begins to help Mike into some pants which, given the situation, is very awkward. ,21400
LARRY Okay. ,3040
Everything is too small. ,8570000
SAM Yeah, you're not kidding. ,20000
Lesley enters the room immediately coming face to face with a naked Mike. ,58800
She doesn't notice Sam who is partially hidden by a clothes rack. ,25200
She just goes about trying a costume shirt. ,667000
LESLEY Oh, that's nice... (To Larry.) Forgive him, Larry. ,1110000
Mike's like my five year old son. ,68200000
Neither one of them has clean underwear... ,4390000
LARRY Or pubic hair, I imagine. (Folding the pants.) Okay, well, I can take out the suit but we're going to need some new pants and shirts. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 24. ,885
LARRY (CONT'D) (Looking back.) And underwear... ,275000
Mike just stands there naked, staring at his penis in the mirror. ,183000
LESLEY (To Larry.) This is too small. (To Mike.) What the hell are you doing? ,294000
MIKE Waiting for Larry to finish. ,1050000
LARRY I'm finished. ,691000
Larry disappears deeper into the costume room. ,58000
MIKE Okay, well, then I'm just standing here with my balls out. ,166000
LESLEY Get dressed. ,38000
Riggan's daughter is hanging around, and I don't need her to walk in here and-- MIKE Leslie... ,153000
LESLEY No, Mike. ,1050000
You haven't seen her. ,719000
She's always hanging around, just-- I don't-- Watching everyone. ,1750000
It's creepy. ,343000
It's-- MIKE Les... ,81700000
LESLEY I don't know if the drugs fried her brain or what, but I don't need her running to her father saying you showed her your junk. ,23300
MIKE Okay, then we should probably get her out of here. ,12400000
Lesley's expression goes blank. ,45100000
LESLEY Oh, God. ,153000
Really? (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 25. ,2
MIKE Hey, Sammy... ,795000
SAM It's Sam. ,8490
LESLEY Fuck. ,12400000
Sam steps forward. ,655000
LESLEY (CONT'D) (To Sam.) I didn't mean-- SAM (Totally relaxed.) It's cool. ,87800
He's a handful, huh? ,2920000
They both look back at Mike. ,74700000
LESLEY Almost. ,685
Sam smiles at her and exits. ,953000
Lesley wheels on Mike. ,288000
LESLEY (CONT'D) Jesus... ,7930
How is it you always manage to find a new way to humiliate me? ,80000
MIKE To be fair, you make it really easy. ,407000
LESLEY What the hell was she doing here? ,173000
MIKE She brought me. ,97400
LESLEY And stayed??? ,9630000
MIKE I know, right? ,71800000
She's a little-- LESLEY Look at me, Mike. ,3770000
This is Broadway. ,11800000
And I'm begging you, if you love me, please, do me a favor... don't fuck it up. ,4190000
MIKE (Gently.) Come here. (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 26. ,171000
Lesley moves toward Mike. ,965000
He cups her face in his hands tenderly. ,11700000
They are face to face. ,2250000
MIKE (CONT'D) Play with my balls... ,59000
She twists his nipples hard and walks out. ,9000
MIKE (CONT'D) I won't fuck it up... ,301000
Probably! Larry reappears holding some clothes. ,339000
We follow him out... 10 INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 10 ...through the hallway. ,503000
He walks by Jake and Riggan who are mid conversation. ,2080
We stay with them. ,42700000
RIGGAN (O.S.) I don't care, sign it. ,5740000
JAKE (O.S.) Listen to me. ,7500000
RIGGAN (O.S.) No you listen to me-- JAKE (O.S.) I can't afford to listen to you... ,790000
LARRY I'm gonna need to go shopping again. ,4110000
JAKE Fucking sew something, you old fuck! RIGGAN I don't care. ,4
Give him what he wants. ,15300000
JAKE His agent is asking for almost four times what we were paying-- RIGGAN Then go into the reserve. ,111000
JAKE The reserve is gone. ,259000
You spent it on the fog. ,2660000
And those fake trees... (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 27. ,4430000
RIGGAN It's a dream sequence, it-- JAKE And three union midgets that dance around like-- RIGGAN You're not supposed to call them midgets-- JAKE The reserve is gone! RIGGAN Listen to me, you didn't see what I just saw. ,614
But you will, at the preview tomorrow. ,73100
Look, get the contract done. ,445000
I'll get the money. ,6350000
Riggan begins marching toward the stage. ,44300
JAKE (Calling after him.) When??? ,196000
Laura comes down some stairs and chases Riggan. ,2180
LAURA (Incredulous.) Hey, is it true? ,4540
Shiner? ,3170000
RIGGAN He's in. ,65700
LAURA Holy shit! When can I meet him? ,62200000
RIGGAN He's in a fitting with Larry. ,7520
Lesley comes down the hallway. ,2230000
LESLEY I'm going to Starbucks. ,1370000
You guys want anything? ,5680000
RIGGAN I'm fine. ,40800000
How's Mike? ,13600000
LESLEY Did you talk to your daughter? ,39400
RIGGAN No. (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 28. ,483000
LESLEY He's great. ,2000000
LAURA (To Lesley. ,13300000
Matter-of- factly.) Honey, your tits look like fucking anjou pears in that top! LESLEY (Uncomfortable.) Okay, well I'm gonna-- Thank you. ,2
She walks away. ,187000
LAURA And that ass. ,260000
Like two eggs in a hanky! A10 A10 Riggan walks, Laura follows him. ,821
LAURA Okay, I was going to tell you this over dinner, but everything-- I have some news too. ,11600000
RIGGAN Good or bad? ,139000
Cause right now-- A technician walks by. ,4120000
LAURA (Whispering.) I missed my last two periods. (Beat.) I think it's happening this time. ,781000
Riggan stops. ,14
LAURA (CONT'D) Is that good or bad? (He stares at her.) Riggan...? ,3270
RIGGAN It's good. ,144000
It's great. ,5790000
She smiles, her eyes filled with emotion. ,799000
Riggan smiles back, and nods absently. ,17700
LAURA Say something else... (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 29. ,5410000
RIGGAN (Joking.) You're pretty sure it's mine? ,41100000
LAURA (Unamused but plays along) Well, let's see. ,352000
There's you. ,31700000
Jake. ,15500000
That masseuse wore a condom so... ,9850
Yes, it's yours... idiot. ,5790000
She puts her head on Riggan's chest. ,592000
We see his mind racing. ,577000
Laura is moved, and confused. ,1950000
LAURA (CONT'D) Are you excited? ,458000
RIGGAN Yeah. ,297
LAURA Me too. ,78900000
Laura moves slightly away from him and suddenly slaps him across the face. ,63700
Riggan looks at her, confused. ,31200
RIGGAN What--? ,520
LAURA You're not funny. ,30000
She kisses him intensely on the lips and briefly places his hand on her belly, then moves it up to her breasts. ,31700
LAURA (CONT'D) First preview tomorrow. ,331000
Here we go! Laura turns and walks away. ,341000
Riggan continues down the corridor. ,3210000
He passes by a Security Guard· in front of a small TV. The camera becomes Riggan's POV and advances until... 11 INT. BACKSTAGE - THEATER - EVENING 11 ...we go through the stage door. ,48
We scan the backstage area to see the stagehands ready to do their jobs. ,76700
We can feel the electricity of a first preview. ,201000
On stage part of the kitchen set from before is visible. ,590000
Annie stands at her podium, calling the cues for the show. ,337000
ANNIE (Into her headset.) Cue 34 and 35. ,55400
Go. (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 30. ,3430000
She turns and looks directly into the camera. ,137000
ANNIE (CONT'D) Places. ,264000
RIGGAN (O.S.) Okay. ,161000
Riggan walks on screen wearing his costume, carrying a bucket of ice and a bottle of gin. ,29600
He goes to the opposite side of the stage and takes his place in the wings. ,724000
He peeks out at the audience who seem to be watching with interest. ,679000
Then we pan to the stage to find Mike, Lesley and Laura performing the scene we saw at the beginning, around the table. ,79200
Mike looks comfortable, sipping at his drink. ,471000
A half empty bottle of gin on the table. ,143000
MIKE The maniac shot himself right in front of us. ,221000
I rode with him in the ambulance to the hospital. ,85900
LESLEY I'll never get that image out of my head. ,160000
Right before he did it, his eyes-- they were so sad... lonely. ,886000
LAURA Did you have to treat him? ,58800000
MIKE I didn't have to. ,30000
But I did. (Pouring another drink.) He was in bad shape. ,66000
His head swelled up to like twice the size of a normal head. ,23700
I'd never seen anything like it. ,66200000
And I swear to God, I hope I never do again. ,34500
Riggan stands near Annie. ,566000
RIGGAN He's good. ,65700
ANNIE He's incredible. ,8460000
I think he's drinking real gin. ,6530000
Riggan looks out at Mike, who is refilling his glass. ,27200
RIGGAN What? (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 31. ,483000
A stagehand gives Riggan a bottle. ,380
Riggan watches and waits for his cue. ,1080
MIKE Ask Nick what real love is. ,72900000
He'll agree with me. ,80000
You watch. ,14100000
LESLEY Why don't we just head to the restaurant? ,2580000
LAURA Don't get him started, Mel. ,45000000
You haven't seen how he's been lately. ,834000
He's been depressed. ,525000
I'm worried about him. ,2930000
He's been-- She gently pushes Riggan and we follow him on stage... 12 INT. STAGE - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 12 ...where Mike goes to refill his glass with the last of the real gin. ,5080
Riggan snatches the bottle out of his hands and gulps the rest, straight from the bottle. ,12200
RIGGAN Been what? (Beat.) I'll tell you what real love is. ,52100000
This happened a few months ago. (Drops bottle on table) And it ought to make us ashamed when we talk like we know what we're talking about when we talk about love. ,22200
LAURA Nick, for God's sake. ,5650000
Are you getting drunk? ,13200000
RIGGAN (Pointed at Mike.) I don't have to be drunk to say what I think. ,51900000
MIKE Nobody's drunk. ,9470000
We're just having a few drinks. ,2660000
LESLEY You've had more than a few. ,1110000
RIGGAN What are you, counting? (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 32. ,4320000
LAURA Don't you talk to her like that. ,1610000
Don't talk like a drunk if you're not-- RIGGAN (Exploding.) Shut up. ,1120000
For once in your life. ,12100000
Will you do me a favor and shut up for a minute? (Beat.) Like I was saying... ,111000
There's this old couple, had a car wreck out on the interstate. ,372000
Some drunk kid plowed his dad's pick up into their camper. ,56600
We begin to hear the underscoring of violins. ,4350
RIGGAN (CONT'D) Fucking teenager. ,22
By the time I got to the hospital, the kid was dead. ,49300000
He was off in a corner laid out on a gurney. ,1620000
We took the old couple up to the O.R.. They were a mess. ,33000000
We worked like hell on them for most of the night... ,541000
Over the speech, Mike reaches for the new bottle that Riggan placed on stage. ,26800
He refills his glass. ,1140000
RIGGAN (CONT'D) When we were done, we wrapped them in full body casts. ,6610
The husband was depressed. ,15600000
Even when I told him his wife was gonna pull through, he was still depressed. ,679000
So, I got up to his mouth hole and asked him, and he told me it was because he couldn't see her through the eye holes. ,171000
Can you imagine? ,11600000
I'm telling you, the man's heart was breaking because he couldn't turn his goddamn head and see his goddamn wife. ,140000
Riggan is doing a good job. ,13600000
Lesley and Laura are genuinely moved. ,13500
Mike notices. ,309000
He sips his drink. ,277000
RIGGAN (CONT'D) I mean... ,4710
It was killing him. ,438000
Killing him that he-- MIKE I'm tired of this shit. ,111000
They all look at Mike. ,6190000
In silence. (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 33. ,3960000
MIKE (CONT'D) (to Riggan) What the fuck is this? ,185000
Water? ,24000000
He hurls the glass against the wall. ,4060000
Some laughter from the audience. ,3110000
Riggan stares at him, confused. ,159000
He presses on. ,87500
RIGGAN It was killing the old bastard... ,3360000
MIKE Did you just give me water? ,41800000
RIGGAN Come on, Mike. ,80000
MIKE Come on what? ,70000
RIGGAN Take it easy. ,235000
You're drunk. ,145000000
MIKE Of course I'm drunk! I'm supposed to be drunk! This is Carver, man! The guy lost a piece of liver every time he wrote a page! If I'm supposed to drink gin then bring me fuckin gin! I mean, you fucked the time period! You took all the good lines for yourself! At least let me-- The audience is now hysterical. ,671
Dozens of cell phones pointing at the stage. ,461000
Mike walks toward the apron, facing the audience. ,77000
MIKE (CONT'D) Oh, okay. ,442000
Seriously? ,14400000
You people are pathetic. ,1510000
Put the cell phones down and join the real world! Will somebody please just live in the real world?!! He crosses to the refrigerator. ,43900
LAURA Where's he going? ,439000
LESLEY (Firmly.) Mike, cut it out. ,234000
Mike rummages through the fridge. (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 34. ,45600
MIKE Look at this. ,15100000
It's all fake. (Tossing items out of the fridge.) The milk is fake. ,219000
The butter is fake. ,2080000
Riggan storms off the stage. ,1070000
MIKE (CONT'D) (To Riggan.) Your performance is fake. (He finds some fried chicken.) Hey! There's chicken. ,2550
Real chicken. ,308000
The only thing real up here is the chicken. ,2710000
So I'm gonna stick with the chicken. ,710000
The audience laughs harder. ,7060000
MIKE (O.S.) (CONT'D) Hey, this is good bird, man! Riggan charges through the chaos backstage running into a panicked Annie. ,55
RIGGAN Get Mike out of here. ,100000
ANNIE How do you want me to do that? ,133000000
Riggan keeps walking up to... 13 INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 13 ...the hallway. ,46800
Jake chases him. ,12700000
RIGGAN I want him gone. ,4800000
JAKE No. RIGGAN What? ,22300
JAKE We can't do that. ,115000000
Citizen Kane By Herman J. ,604000
Mankiewicz & Orson Welles PROLOGUE FADE IN: EXT. XANADU - FAINT DAWN - 1940 (MINIATURE) Window, very small in the distance, illuminated. ,418000
All around this is an almost totally black screen. ,252000
Now, as the camera moves slowly towards the window which is almost a postage stamp in the frame, other forms appear; barbed wire, cyclone fencing, and now, looming up against an early morning sky, enormous iron grille work. ,55600
Camera travels up what is now shown to be a gateway of gigantic proportions and holds on the top of it - a huge initial "K" showing darker and darker against the dawn sky. ,10300
Through this and beyond we see the fairy-tale mountaintop of Xanadu, the great castle a sillhouette as its summit, the little window a distant accent in the darkness. ,81
DISSOLVE: A SERIES OF SET -UPS, EACH CLOSER TO THE GREAT WINDOW, ALL TELLING SOMETHING OF: The literally incredible domain of CHARLES FOSTER KANE. Its right flank resting for nearly forty miles on the Gulf Coast, it truly extends in all directions farther than the eye can see. ,56
Designed by nature to be almost completely bare and flat - it was, as will develop, practically all marshland when Kane acquired and changed its face - it is now pleasantly uneven, with its fair share of rolling hills and one very good- sized mountain, all man-made. ,14
Almost all the land is improved, either through cultivation for farming purposes of through careful landscaping, in the shape of parks and lakes. ,6700
The castle dominates itself, an enormous pile, compounded of several genuine castles, of European origin, of varying architecture - dominates the scene, from the very peak of the mountain. ,4000
DISSOLVE: GOLF LINKS (MINIATURE) Past which we move. ,332000
The greens are straggly and overgrown, the fairways wild with tropical weeds, the links unused and not seriously tended for a long time. ,7810
DISSOLVE OUT: DISSOLVE IN: WHAT WAS ONCE A GOOD-SIZED ZOO (MINIATURE) Of the Hagenbeck type. ,7380
All that now remains, with one exception, are the individual plots, surrounded by moats, on which the animals are kept, free and yet safe from each other and the landscape at large. (Signs on several of the plots indicate that here there were once tigers, lions, girrafes.) DISSOLVE: THE MONKEY TERRACE (MINIATURE) In the foreground, a great obscene ape is outlined against the dawn murk. ,16400
He is scratching himself slowly, thoughtfully, looking out across the estates of Charles Foster Kane, to the distant light glowing in the castle on the hill. ,57
DISSOLVE: THE ALLIGATOR PIT (MINIATURE) The idiot pile of sleepy dragons. ,25800
Reflected in the muddy water - the lighted window. ,14900
THE LAGOON (MINIATURE) The boat landing sags. ,315000
An old newspaper floats on the surface of the water - a copy of the New York Enquirer." As it moves across the frame, it discloses again the reflection of the window in the castle, closer than before. ,11800
THE GREAT SWIMMING POOL (MINIATURE) It is empty. ,1120000
A newspaper blows across the cracked floor of the tank. ,441000
DISSOLVE: THE COTTAGES (MINIATURE) In the shadows, literally the shadows, of the castle. ,310000
As we move by, we see that their doors and windows are boarded up and locked, with heavy bars as further protection and sealing. ,350000
DISSOLVE OUT: DISSOLVE IN: A DRAWBRIDGE (MINIATURE) Over a wide moat, now stagnant and choked with weeds. ,12200
We move across it and through a huge solid gateway into a formal garden, perhaps thirty yards wide and one hundred yards deep, which extends right up to the very wall of the castle. ,22000
The landscaping surrounding it has been sloppy and causal for a long time, but this particular garden has been kept up in perfect shape. ,9570
As the camera makes its way through it, towards the lighted window of the castle, there are revealed rare and exotic blooms of all kinds. ,1820
The dominating note is one of almost exaggerated tropical lushness, hanging limp and despairing. ,6340
Moss, moss, moss. ,31800000
Ankor Wat, the night the last King died. ,10800000
DISSOLVE: THE WINDOW (MINIATURE) Camera moves in until the frame of the window fills the frame of the screen. ,18900
Suddenly, the light within goes out. ,122000
This stops the action of the camera and cuts the music which has been accompanying the sequence. ,46100
In the glass panes of the window, we see reflected the ripe, dreary landscape of Mr. Kane's estate behind and the dawn sky. ,12000
DISSOLVE: INT. KANE'S BEDROOM - FAINT DAWN - A very long shot of Kane's enormous bed, silhouetted against the enormous window. ,4410
DISSOLVE: INT. KANE'S BEDROOM - FAINT DAWN - SNOW SCENE. An incredible one. ,132000
Big, impossible flakes of snow, a too picturesque farmhouse and a snow man. ,665000
The jingling of sleigh bells in the musical score now makes an ironic reference to Indian Temple bells - the music freezes - KANE'S OLD OLD VOICE Rosebud... ,1880
The camera pulls back, showing the whole scene to be contained in one of those glass balls which are sold in novelty stores all over the world. ,31000
A hand - Kane's hand, which has been holding the ball, relaxes. ,52400
The ball falls out of his hand and bounds down two carpeted steps leading to the bed, the camera following. ,114000
The ball falls off the last step onto the marble floor where it breaks, the fragments glittering in the first rays of the morning sun. ,10700
This ray cuts an angular pattern across the floor, suddenly crossed with a thousand bars of light as the blinds are pulled across the window. ,454
The foot of Kane's bed. ,8370000
The camera very close. ,394000
Outlined against the shuttered window, we can see a form - the form of a nurse, as she pulls the sheet up over his head. ,6220
The camera follows this action up the length of the bed and arrives at the face after the sheet has covered it. ,53800
FADE OUT: FADE IN: INT. OF A MOTION PICTURE PROJECTION ROOM On the screen as the camera moves in are the words: "MAIN TITLE" Stirring, brassy music is heard on the soundtrack (which, of course, sounds more like a soundtrack than ours.) The screen in the projection room fills our screen as the second title appears: "CREDITS" NOTE: Here follows a typical news digest short, one of the regular monthly or bi-monthly features, based on public events or personalities. ,23
These are distinguished from ordinary newsreels and short subjects in that they have a fully developed editorial or storyline. ,4200
Some of the more obvious characteristics of the "March of Time," for example, as well as other documentary shorts, will be combined to give an authentic impression of this now familiar type of short subject. ,64700
As is the accepted procedure in these short subjects, a narrator is used as well as explanatory titles. ,24400
FADE OUT: NEWS DIGEST NARRATOR Legendary was the Xanadu where Kubla Kahn decreed his stately pleasure dome - (with quotes in his voice) "Where twice five miles of fertile ground, with walls and towers were girdled 'round." (DROPPING THE QUOTES) Today, almost as legendary is Florida's XANADU - world's largest private pleasure ground. ,19
Here, on the deserts of the Gulf Coast, a private mountain was commissioned, successfully built for its landlord. ,19400
Here in a private valley, as in the Coleridge poem, "blossoms many an incense-bearing tree." Verily, "a miracle of rare device." U.S.A. ,5860
CHARLES FOSTER KANE Opening shot of great desolate expanse of Florida coastline (1940 - DAY) DISSOLVE: Series of shots showing various aspects of Xanadu, all as they might be photographed by an ordinary newsreel cameraman - nicely photographed, but not atmospheric to the extreme extent of the Prologue (1940). ,19
NARRATOR (dropping the quotes) Here, for Xanadu's landlord, will be held 1940's biggest, strangest funeral; here this week is laid to rest a potent figure of our Century - America's Kubla Kahn - Charles Foster Kane. ,1900
In journalism's history, other names are honored more than Charles Foster Kane's, more justly revered. ,269000
Among publishers, second only to James Gordon Bennet the First: his dashing, expatriate son; England's Northcliffe and Beaverbrook; Chicago's Patterson and McCormick; TITLE: TO FORTY-FOUR MILLION U.S. ,7310
NEWS BUYERS, MORE NEWSWORTHY THAN THE NAMES IN HIS OWN HEADLINES, WAS KANE HIMSELF, GREATEST NEWSPAPER TYCOON OF THIS OR ANY OTHER GENERATION. Shot of a huge, screen-filling picture of Kane. ,23400
Pull back to show that it is a picture on the front page of the "Enquirer," surrounded by the reversed rules of mourning, with masthead and headlines. (1940) DISSOLVE: A great number of headlines, set in different types and different styles, obviously from different papers, all announcing Kane's death, all appearing over photographs of Kane himself (perhaps a fifth of the headlines are in foreign languages). ,1080
An important item in connection with the headlines is that many of them - positively not all - reveal passionately conflicting opinions about Kane. ,52200
Thus, they contain variously the words "patriot," "democrat," "pacifist," "war-monger," "traitor," "idealist," "American," etc. ,6200
TITLE: 1895 TO 1940 - ALL OF THESE YEARS HE COVERED, MANY OF THESE YEARS HE WAS. Newsreel shots of San Francisco during and after the fire, followed by shots of special trains with large streamers: "Kane Relief Organization." Over these shots superimpose the date - 1906. ,77
Artist's painting of Foch's railroad car and peace negotiators, if actual newsreel shot unavailable. ,6750
Over this shot sumperimpose the date - 1918. ,32
NARRATOR Denver's Bonfils and Sommes; New York's late, great Joseph Pulitzer; America's emperor of the news syndicate, another editorialist and landlord, the still mighty and once mightier Hearst. ,9900
Great names all of them - but none of them so loved, hated, feared, so often spoken - as Charles Foster Kane. ,14600
The San Francisco earthquake. ,2010000
First with the news were the Kane papers. ,763000
First with Relief of the Sufferers, First with the news of their Relief of the Sufferers. ,15500000
Kane papers scoop the world on the Armistice - publish, eight hours before competitors, complete details of the Armistice teams granted the Germans by Marshall Foch from his railroad car in the Forest of Compeigne. ,42
For forty years appeared in Kane newsprint no public issue on which Kane papers took no stand. ,372000
No public man whom Kane himself did not support or denounce - often support, then denounce. ,48600
Its humble beginnings, a dying dailey - Shots with the date - 1898 (to be supplied) Shots with the date - 1910 (to be supplied) Shots with the date - 1922 (to be supplied) Headlines, cartoons, contemporary newreels or stills of the following: 1. ,18

Also, recent newsreels of the elderly Kane with such Nazis as Hitler and Goering; and England's Chamberlain and Churchill. ,84300
Shot of a ramshackle building with old-fashioned presses showing through plate glass windows and the name "Enquirer" in old- fashioned gold letters. (1892) DISSOLVE: NARRATOR Kane's empire, in its glory, held dominion over thirty-seven newpapers, thirteen magazines, a radio network. ,11700
An empire upon an empire. ,6720000
The first of grocery stores, paper mills, apartment buildings, factories, forests, ocean-liners - An empire through which for fifty years flowed, in an unending stream, the wealth of the earth's third richest gold mine... ,470
Famed in American legend is the origin of the Kane fortune... ,108000
How, to boarding housekeeper Mary Kane, by a defaulting boarder, in 1868 was left the supposedly worthless deed to an abandoned mine shaft: The Colorado Lode. ,37
The magnificent Enquirer Building of today. 1891-1911 - a map of the USA, covering the entire screen, which in animated diagram shows the Kane publications spreading from city to city. ,32500
Starting from New York, minature newboys speed madly to Chicago, Detroit, St. Louis, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington, Atlanta, El Paso, etc., screaming "Wuxtry, Kane Papers, Wuxtry." Shot of a large mine going full blast, chimneys belching smoke, trains moving in and out, etc. ,19
A large sign reads "Colorado Lode Mining Co." (1940) Sign reading; "Little Salem, CO - 25 MILES." DISSOLVE: An old still shot of Little Salem as it was 70 years ago (identified by copper-plate caption beneath the still). (1870) Shot of early tintype stills of Thomas Foster Kane and his wife, Mary, on their wedding day. ,64300

Shot of Capitol, in Washington D.C. ,2250000

Walter P. ,380000
Thatcher is on the stand. ,5720000
He is flanked by his son, Walter P. ,8960
Thatcher Jr., and other partners. ,469000
He is being questioned by some Merry Andrew congressmen. ,80600
At this moment, a baby alligator has just been placed in his lap, causing considerable confusion and embarrassment. ,16800
Newsreel close-up of Thatcher, the soundtrack of which now fades in. ,11100
THATCHER ... because of that trivial incident... ,15800
INVESTIGATOR It is a fact, however, is it not, that in 1870, you did go to Colorado? ,357000
THATCHER I did. ,24400000
INVESTIGATOR In connection with the Kane affairs? ,91400
THATCHER Yes. ,4330
My firm had been appointed trustees by Mrs. ,1320000
Kane for the fortune, which she had recently acquired. ,1570000
It was her wish that I should take charge of this boy, Charles Foster Kane. ,765000
NARRATOR That same month in Union Square - INVESTIGATOR Is it not a fact that on that occasion, the boy personally attacked you after striking you in the stomach with a sled? ,3070
Loud laughter and confusion. ,848000
THATCHER Mr. Chairman, I will read to this committee a prepared statement I have brought with me - and I will then refuse to answer any further questions. ,8560
Mr. Johnson, please! A young assistant hands him a sheet of paper from a briefcase. ,13000
THATCHER (reading it) "With full awareness of the meaning of my words and the responsibility of what I am about to say, it is my considered belief that Mr. Charles Foster Kane, in every essence of his social beliefs and by the dangerous manner in which he has persistently attacked the American traditions of private property, initiative and opportunity for advancement, is - in fact - nothing more or less than a Communist." Newsreel of Union Square meeting, section of crowd carrying banners urging the boycott of Kane papers. ,36600
A speaker is on the platform above the crowd. ,104000
SPEAKER (fading in on soundtrack) - till the words "Charles Foster Kane" are a menace to every working man in this land. ,815
He is today what he has always been and always will be - A FASCIST! NARRATOR And yet another opinion - Kane's own. ,252000
Silent newsreel on a windy platform, flag-draped, in front of the magnificent Enquirer building. ,12200
On platform, in full ceremonial dress, is Charles Foster Kane. ,111000
He orates silently. ,4650
TITLE: "I AM, HAVE BEEN, AND WILL BE ONLY ONE THING - AN AMERICAN." CHARLES FOSTER KANE. Same locale, Kane shaking hands out of frame. ,934000
Another newsreel shot, much later, very brief, showing Kane, older and much fatter, very tired-looking, seated with his second wife in a nightclub. ,1990
He looks lonely and unhappy in the midst of the gaiety. ,18600
NARRATOR Twice married, twice divorced - first to a president's niece, Emily Norton - today, by her second marriage, chatelaine of the oldest of England's stately homes. ,1950
Sixteen years after that - two weeks after his divorce from Emily Norton - Kane married Susan Alexander, singer, at the Town Hall in Trenton, New Jersey. ,1680
TITLE: FEW PRIVATE LIVES WERE MORE PUBLIC. Period still of Emily Norton (1900). ,14700
DISSOLVE: Reconstructed silent newsreel. ,18100
Kane, Susan, and Bernstein emerging from side doorway of City Hall into a ring of press photographers, reporters, etc. ,37900
Kane looks startled, recoils for an instance, then charges down upon the photographers, laying about him with his stick, smashing whatever he can hit. ,4700
NARRATOR For wife two, one-time opera singing Susan Alexander, Kane built Chicago's Municipal Opera House. ,48800
Cost: three million dollars. ,27100000
Conceived for Susan Alexander Kane, half-finished before she divorced him, the still unfinished Xanadu. ,894
Cost: no man can say. ,28200000
Still of architect's sketch with typically glorified "rendering" of the Chicago Municipal Opera House. ,78200
DISSOLVE: A glamorous shot of the almost-finished Xanadu, a magnificent fairy-tale estate built on a mountain. (1920) Then shots of its preparation. (1917) Shots of truck after truck, train after train, flashing by with tremendous noise. ,304
Shots of vast dredges, steamshovels. ,34
Shot of ship standing offshore unloading its lighters. ,24900
In quick succession, shots follow each other, some reconstructed, some in miniature, some real shots (maybe from the dam projects) of building, digging, pouring concrete, etc. ,26200
NARRATOR One hundred thousand trees, twenty thousand tons of marble, are the ingredients of Xanadu's mountain. ,10100
Xanadu's livestock: the fowl of the air, the fish of the sea, the beast of the field and jungle - two of each; the biggest private zoo since Noah. ,28900
Contents of Kane's palace: paintings, pictures, statues, the very stones of many another palace, shipped to Florida from every corner of the earth, from other Kane houses, warehouses, where they mouldered for years. ,94
Enough for ten museums - the loot of the world. ,119000
More shots as before, only this time we see (in miniature) a large mountain - at different periods in its development - rising out of the sands. ,5730
Shots of elephants, apes, zebras, etc. being herded, unloaded, shipped, etc. in various ways. ,253
Shots of packing cases being unloaded from ships, from trains, from trucks, with various kinds of lettering on them (Italian, Arabian, Chinese, etc.) but all consigned to Charles Foster Kane, Xanadu, Florida. ,34000
A reconstructed still of Xanadu - the main terrace. ,4890
A group of persons in clothes of the period of 1917. ,969000
In their midst, clearly recognizable, are Kane and Susan. ,21000
NARRATOR Kane urged his country's entry into one war, opposed participation in another. ,10300
Swung the election to one American President at least, was called another's assassin. ,1420000
Thus, Kane's papers might never have survived - had not the President. ,21300
TITLE: FROM XANADU, FOR THE PAST TWENTY-FIVE YEARS, ALL KANE ENTERPRISES HAVE BEEN DIRECTED, MANY OF THE NATIONS DESTINIES SHAPED. Shots of various authentically worded headlines of American papers since 1895. ,18
Spanish-American War shots. (1898) A graveyard in France of the World War and hundreds of crosses. (1919) Old newsreels of a political campaign. ,19200
Insert of a particularly virulent headline and/or cartoon. ,23200
HEADLINE: "PRESIDENT SHOT" NARRATOR Kane, molder of mass opinion though he was, in all his life was never granted elective office by the voters of his country. ,1300000
Few U.S. news publishers have been. ,23400000
Few, like one-time Congressman Hearst, have ever run for any office - most know better - conclude with other political observers that one man's press has power enough for himself. ,2460
But Kane papers were once strong indeed, and once the prize seemed almost his. ,328000
Kane and young Howard Kane, age five. ,3180000
They are acknowledging the cheers of the crowd. (Silent Shot) (1910) Newreel shot of dignitaries on platform, with Kane, alongside of speaker's table, beaming, hand upraised to silence the crowd. (Silent Shot) (1910) NARRATOR Then, suddenly - less than one week before election - defeat! Shameful, ignominious - defeat that set back for twenty years the cause of reform in the U.S., forever cancelled political chances for Charles Foster Kane. ,74
Then, in the third year of the Great Depression... ,1680000
As to all publishers, it sometimes must - to Bennett, to Munsey and Hearst it did - a paper closes! For Kane, in four short years: collapse! Eleven Kane papers, four Kane magazines merged, more sold, scrapped - Newreel shot - closeup of Kane delivering a speech... (1910) The front page of a contemporary paper - a screaming headline. ,20
Twin phots of Kane and Susan. (1910) Printed title about Depression. ,13300
Once more repeat the map of the USA 1932-1939. ,86200000
Suddenly, the cartoon goes into reverse, the empire begins to shrink, illustrating the narrator's words. ,16300
The door of a newspaper office with the signs: "Closed." NARRATOR Then four long years more - alone in his never-finished, already decaying, pleasure palace, aloof, seldom visited, never photographed, Charles Foster Kane continued to direct his falling empire ... vainly attempting to sway, as he once did, the destinies of a nation that has ceased to listen to him ... ceased to trust him... ,9140
SHOTS OF XANADU. (1940) Series of shots, entirely modern, but rather jumpy and obviously bootlegged, showing Kane in a bath chair, swathed in summer rugs, being perambulated through his rose garden, a desolate figure in the sunshine. (1935) NARRATOR Last week, death came to sit upon the throne of America's Kubla Khan - last week, as it must to all men, death came to Charles Foster Kane. ,41
DISSOLVE: Cabinent Photograph (Full Screen) of Kane as an old, old man. ,8250
This image remains constant on the screen (as camera pulls back, taking in the interior of a dark projection room. ,1410
INT. PROJECTION ROOM - DAY - A fairly large one, with a long throw to the screen. ,119000
The image of Kane as an old man remains constant on the screen as camera pulls back, slowly taking in and registering Projection Room. ,4080
This action occurs, however, only after the first few lines of encuring dialogue have been spoken. ,81900
The shadows of the men speaking appear as they rise from their chairs - black against the image of Kane's face on the screen. ,74300
NOTE: These are the editors of a "News Digest" short, and of the Rawlston magazines. ,91500
All his enterprises are represented in the projection room, and Rawlston himself, that great man, is present also and will shortly speak up. ,129000
During the entire course of this scene, nobody's face is really seen. ,21100000
Sections of their bodies are picked out by a table light, a silhouette is thrown on the screen, and their faces and bodies are themselves thrown into silhouette against the brilliant slanting rays of light from the projection room. ,2460
A Third Man is on the telephone. ,5630000
We see a corner of his head and the phone. ,969000
THIRD MAN (at phone) Stand by. ,80600000
I'll tell you if we want to run it again. (hangs up) THOMPSON'S VOICE Well? ,3720000
A short pause. ,3230000
A MAN'S VOICE It's a tough thing to do in a newsreel. ,22400000
Seventy years of a man's life - Murmur of highly salaried assent at this. ,384000
Rawlston walks toward camera and out of the picture. ,36200
Others are rising. ,11000
Camera during all of this, apparently does its best to follow action and pick up faces, but fails. ,123000
Actually, all set-ups are to be planned very carefully to exclude the element of personality from this scene; which is expressed entirely by voices, shadows, sillhouettes and the big, bright image of Kane himself on the screen. ,9260
A VOICE See what Arthur Ellis wrote about him in the American review? ,1280000
THIRD MAN I read it. ,74200000
THE VOICE (its owner is already leaning across the table, holding a piece of paper under the desk light and reading from it) Listen: Kane is dead. ,13000
He contributed to the journalism of his day - the talent of a mountebank, the morals of a bootlegger, and the manners of a pasha. ,5670
He and his kind have almost succeeded in transforming a once noble profession into a seven percent security - no longer secure. ,6300
ANOTHER VOICE That's what Arthur Ellis is writing now. ,4110000
Thirty years ago, when Kane gave him his chance to clean up Detroit and Chicago and St. Louis, Kane was the greatest guy in the world. ,11400
If you ask me - ANOTHER VOICE Charles Foster Kane was a... ,248000
Then observations are made almost simultaneous. ,300000
RAWLSTON'S VOICE Just a minute! Camera moves to take in his bulk outlined against the glow from the projection room. ,17
RAWLSTON What were Kane's last words? ,136000
A silence greets this. ,169000
RAWLSTON What were the last words he said on earth? ,14900000
Thompson, you've made us a good short, but it needs character - SOMEBODY'S VOICE Motivation - RAWLSTON That's it - motivation. ,5370000
What made Kane what he was? ,4120000
And, for that matter, what was he? ,4120000
What we've just seen are the outlines of a career - what's behind the career? ,1940000
What's the man? ,25500000
Was he good or bad? ,86700000
Strong or foolish? ,1380000
Tragic or silly? ,72
Why did he do all those things? ,134000000
What was he after? (then, appreciating his point) Maybe he told us on his death bed. ,1600000
THOMPSON Yes, and maybe he didn't. ,23500000
RAWLSTON Ask the question anyway, Thompson! Build the picture around the question, even if you can't answer it. ,22400000
THOMPSON I know, but - RAWLSTON (riding over him like any other producer) All we saw on that screen was a big American - A VOICE One of the biggest. ,68900
RAWLSTON (without pausing for this) But how is he different from Ford? ,271000
Or Hearst for that matter? ,5310000
Or Rockefeller - or John Doe? ,9
A VOICE I know people worked for Kane will tell you - not only in the newspaper business - look how he raised salaries. ,65500
You don't want to forget - ANOTHER VOICE You take his labor record alone, they ought to hang him up like a dog. ,9920
RAWLSTON I tell you, Thompson - a man's dying words - SOMEBODY'S VOICE What were they? ,48300
SOMEBODY'S VOICE (hesitant) Yes, Mr. Rawlston, what were Kane's dying words? ,596000
RAWLSTON (with disgust) Rosebud! A little ripple of laughter at this, which is promptly silenced by Rawlston. ,3820
RAWLSTON That's right. ,141000000
A VOICE Tough guy, huh? (derisively) Dies calling for Rosebud! RAWLSTON Here's a man who might have been President. ,1680
He's been loved and hated and talked about as much as any man in our time - but when he comes to die, he's got something on his mind called "Rosebud." What does that mean? ,424000
ANOTHER VOICE A racehorse he bet on once, probably, that didn't come in - Rosebud! RAWLSTON All right. ,75
But what was the race? ,17500000
There is a short silence. ,8300000
RAWLSTON Thompson! THOMPSON Yes, sir. ,56
RAWLSTON Hold this thing up for a week. ,2980000
Two weeks if you have to... ,3410000
THOMPSON (feebly) But don't you think if we release it now - he's only been dead four days it might be better than if - RAWLSTON (decisively) Nothing is ever better than finding out what makes people tick. ,1450
Go after the people that knew Kane well. ,28000000
That manager of his - the little guy, Bernstein, those two wives, all the people who knew him, had worked for him, who loved him, who hated his guts - (pauses) I don't mean go through the City Directory, of course - The Third Man gives a hearty "yes-man" laugh. ,86500
THOMPSON I'll get to it right away, Mr. Rawlston. ,3180000
RAWLSTON (rising) Good! The camera from behind him, outlines his back against Kane's picture on the screen. ,2850000
RAWLSTON'S VOICE It'll probably turn out to be a very simple thing... ,1030000
FADE OUT: NOTE: Now begins the story proper - the seach by Thompson for the facts about Kane - his researches ... his interviews with the people who knew Kane. ,381
It is important to remember always that only at the very end of the story is Thompson himself a personality. ,7170000
Until then, throughout the picture, we photograph only Thompson's back, shoulders, or his shadow - sometimes we only record his voice. ,99300
He is not until the final scene a "character". ,1840000
He is the personification of the search for the truth about Charles Foster Kane. ,720000
He is the investigator. ,5100000
FADE IN: EXT. CHEAP CABARET - "EL RANCHO" - ATLANTIC CITY - NIGHT - 1940 (MINIATURE) - RAIN The first image to register is a sign: "EL RANCHO" FLOOR SHOW SUSAN ALEXANDER KANE TWICE NIGHTLY These words, spelled out in neon, glow out of the darkness at the end of the fade out. ,26
Then there is lightning which reveals a squalid roof-top on which the sign stands. ,2120000
Thunder again, and faintly the sound of music from within. ,190000
A light glows from a skylight. ,23900
The camera moves to this and closes in. ,307000
Through the splashes of rain, we see through the skylight down into the interior of the cabaret. ,99
Directly below us at a table sits the lone figure of a woman, drinking by herself. ,21000
DISSOLVE: INT. "EL RANCO" CABARET - NIGHT - Medium shot of the same woman as before, finishing the drink she started to take above. ,10900
It is Susie. ,9890000
The music, of course, is now very loud. ,371000
Thompson, his back to the camera, moves into the picture in the close foreground. ,1630000
A Captain appears behind Susie, speaking across her to Thompson. ,2400000
THE CAPTAIN (a Greek) This is Mr. Thompson, Miss Alexander. ,284000
Susan looks up into Thompson's face. ,1880000
She is fifty, trying to look much younger, cheaply blonded, in a cheap, enormously generous evening dress. ,12200
Blinking up into Thompson's face, she throws a crink into ther mouth. ,36200
Her eyes, which she thinks is keeping commandingly on his, are bleared and watery. ,2000000
SUSAN (to the Captain) I want another drink, John. ,4590000
Low thunder from outside. ,3430000
THE CAPTAIN (seeing his chance) Right away. ,96700
Will you have something, Mr. Thompson? ,322000
THOMPSON (staring to sit down) I'll have a highball. ,303000
SUSAN (so insistently as to make Thompson change his mind and stand up again) Who told you you could sit down here? ,7620
THOMPSON Oh! I thought maybe we could have a drink together? ,6830000
SUSAN Think again! There is an awkward pause as Thompson looks from her to the Captain. ,86700
SUSAN Why don't you people let me alone? ,667000
I'm minding my own business. ,145000
You mind yours. ,949000
THOMPSON If you'd just let me talk to you for a little while, Miss Alexander. ,1630000
All I want to ask you... ,79900000
SUSAN Get out of here! (almost hysterical) Get out! Get out! Thompson looks at the Captain, who shrugs his shoulders. ,79500
THOMPSON I'm sorry. ,2650000
Maybe some other time - If he thought he would get a response from Susan, who thinks she is looking at him steelily, he realizes his error. ,2990
He nods and walks off, following the Captain out the door. ,98500
THE CAPTAIN She's just not talking to anybody from the newspapers, Mr. Thompson. ,628000
THOMPSON I'm not from a newspaper exactly, I - They have come upon a waiter standing in front of a booth. ,211000
THE CAPTAIN (to the waiter) Get her another highball. ,138000
THE WAITER Another double? ,566000
THE CAPTAIN (after a moment, pityingly) Yes. ,60
They walk to the door. ,71400000
THOMPSON She's plastered, isn't she? ,783000
THE CAPTAIN She'll snap out of it. ,157000
Why, until he died, she'd just as soon talk about Mr. Kane as about anybody. ,324000
Sooner. ,12400000
THOMPSON I'll come down in a week or so and see her again. ,49000000
Say, you might be able to help me. ,11300000
When she used to talk about Kane - did she ever happen to say anything - about Rosebud? ,875000
THE CAPTAIN Rosebud? ,9440000
Thompson has just handed him a bill. ,2620000
The Captain pockets it. ,561000
THE CAPTAIN Thank you, sir. ,2510000
As a matter of fact, yesterday afternoon, when it was in all the papers - I asked her. ,48900
She never heard of Rosebud. ,108000
FADE OUT: FADE IN: INT. THATCHER MEMORIAL LIBRARY - DAY - An excruciatingly noble interpretation of Mr. Thatcher himself executed in expensive marble. ,877
He is shown seated on one of those improbable Edwin Booth chairs and is looking down, his stone eyes fixed on the camera. ,16500
We move down off of this, showing the impressive pedestal on which the monument is founded. ,222000
The words, "Walter Parks Thatcher" are prominently and elegantly engraved thereon. ,7610
Immediately below the inscription we encounter, in a medium shot, the person of Bertha Anderson, an elderly, manish spinnster, seated behind her desk. ,39
Thompson, his hat in his hand, is standing before her. ,2220000
Bertha is on the phone. ,8450000
BERTHA (into phone) Yes. ,730000
I'll take him in now. (hangs up and looks at Thompson) The directors of the Thatcher Library have asked me to remind you again of the condition under which you may inspect certain portions of Mr. Thatcher's unpublished memoirs. ,14300
Under no circumstances are direct quotations from his manuscript to be used by you. ,736000
THOMPSON That's all right. ,115000
BERTHA You may come with me. ,51700
Without watching whether he is following her or not, she rises and starts towards a distant and imposingly framed door. ,11800
Thompson, with a bit of a sigh, follows. ,3100000
DISSOLVE OUT: DISSOLVE IN: INT. THE VAULT ROOM - THATCHER MEMORIAL LIBRARY - DAY - A room with all the warmth and charm of Napolean's tomb. ,8230
As we dissolve in, the door opens in and we see past Thompson's shoulders the length of the room. ,79500
Everything very plain, very much made out of marble and very gloomy. ,229000
Illumination from a skylight above adds to the general air of expensive and classical despair. ,8370
The floor is marble, and there is a gigantic, mahogany table in the center of everything. ,123000
Beyond this is to be seen, sunk in the marble wall at the far end of the room, the safe from which a guard, in a khaki uniform, with a revolver holster at his hip, is extracting the journal of Walter P. ,15900
Thatcher. ,8770000
He brings it to Bertha as if he were the guardian of a bullion shipment. ,5180
During this, Bertha has been speaking. ,6
BERTHA (to the guard) Pages eighty-three to one hundred and forty-two, Jennings. ,800000
GUARD Yes, Miss Anderson. ,653000
BERTHA (to Thompson) You will confine yourself, it is our understanding, to the chapter dealing with Mr. Kane. ,37700
THOMPSON That's all I'm interested in. ,6150000
The guard has, by this time, delivered the precious journal. ,4280000
Bertha places it reverently on the table before Thompson. ,39900
BERTHA You will be required to leave this room at four-thirty promptly. ,745000
She leaves. ,717000
Thompson starts to light a cigarette. ,1290000
The guard shakes his head. ,604000
With a sigh, Thompson bends over to read the manuscript. ,16500
Camera moves down over his shoulder onto page of manuscript. ,147000
THE FACTS ARE SIMPLE. IN THE WINTER OF 1870..." The camera has not held on the entire page. ,2970000
It has been following the words with the same action that the eye does the reading. ,3630000
On the last words, the white page of the paper DISSOLVES INTO: EXT. MRS. KANE'S BOARDINGHOUSE - DAY - The white of a great field of snow, seen from the angle of a parlor window. ,3850
In the same position of the last word in above Insert, appears the tiny figure of Charles Foster Kane, aged five (almost like an animated cartoon). ,894
He is in the act of throwing a snowball at the camera. ,50400
It sails toward us and over our heads, out of scene. ,2210000
Reverse angle - on the house featuring a large sign reading: MRS. KANE'S BOARDINGHOUSE HIGH CLASS MEALS AND LODGING INQUIRE WITHIN Charles Kane's snowball hits the sign. ,31200
INT. PARLOR - MRS. KANE'S BOARDINGHOUSE - DAY - Camera is angling through the window, but the window-frame is not cut into scene. ,166000
We see only the field of snow again, same angle as in previous scene. ,3060000
Charles is manufacturing another snowball. ,82600
Now - Camera pulls back, the frame of the window appearing, and we are inside the parlor of the boardinghouse. ,8680
Kane, aged about 28, is looking out towards her son. ,51400
Just as we take her in she speaks: MRS. KANE (calling out) Be careful, Charles! THATCHER'S VOICE Mrs. ,39000
Kane - MRS. KANE (Calling out the window almost on top of this) Pull your muffler around your neck, Charles - But Charles, deliriously happy in the snow, is oblivious to this and is running away. ,2260
Kane turns into camera and we see her face - a strong face, worn and kind. ,80200
THATCHER'S VOICE think we'll have to tell him now - Camera now pulls back further, showing Thatcher standing before a table on which is his stove-pipe hat and an imposing multiplicity of official-looking documents. ,2640
He is 26 and, as might be expected, a very stuffy young man, already very expensive and conservative looking, even in Colorado. ,16700
MRS. KANE I'll sign those papers - KANE SR. You people seem to forget that I'm the boy's father. ,19200
At the sound of Kane Sr.'s voice, both have turned to him and the camera pulls back still further, taking him in. ,12800
Kane Sr., who is the assistant curator in a livery stable, has been groomed as elegantly as is likely for this meeting ever since daybreak. ,716
From outside the window can be heard faintly the wild and cheerful cries of the boy, blissfully cavorting in the snow. ,12200
MRS. KANE It's going to be done exactly the way I've told Mr. Thatcher - KANE SR. If I want to, I can go to court. father has a right to - THATCHER (annoyed) Mr. Kane, the certificates that Mr. Graves left here are made out to Mrs. ,12000
Kane, in her name. ,6830000
Hers to do with as she pleases - KANE SR. Well, I don't hold with signing my boy away to any bank as guardian just because - MRS. KANE (quietly) I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim. ,29400
THATCHER The Bank's decision in all matters concerning his education, his place of residence and similar subjects will be final. (clears his throat) KANE SR. The idea of a bank being the guardian - Mrs. ,737
Kane has met his eye. ,5690000
Her triumph over him finds expression in his failure to finish his sentence. ,42000
MRS. KANE (even more quietly) I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim. ,11200
THATCHER We will assume full management of the Colorado Lode - of which you, Mrs. ,25500
Kane, are the sole owner. ,4370000
Kane Sr. opens his mouth once or twice, as if to say something, but chokes down his opinion. ,31800
MRS. KANE (has been reading past Thatcher's shoulder as he talked) Where do I sign, Mr. Thatcher? ,3100
THATCHER Right here, Mrs. ,208000
Kane. ,15200000
KANE SR. (sulkily) Don't say I didn't warn you. ,1240000
Kane lifts the quill pen. ,9180
KANE SR. Mary, I'm asking you for the last time - anyon'd think I hadn't been a good husband and a - Mrs. ,623
Kane looks at him slowly. ,963000
He stops his speech. ,10900000
THATCHER The sum of fifty thousand dollars a year is to be paid to yourself and Mr. Kane as long as you both live, and thereafter the survivor - Mrs. ,26500
Kane puts pen to the paper and signs. ,2120000
KANE SR. Well, let's hope it's all for the best. ,101000000
MRS. KANE It is. ,6
Go on, Mr. Thatcher - Mrs. ,563000
Kane, listening to Thatcher, of course has had her other ear bent in the direction of the boy's voice. ,84000
Thatcher is aware both of the boy's voice, which is counter to his own, and of Mrs. ,109000
Kane's divided attention. ,27100
As he pauses, Kane Sr. genteelly walks over to close the window. ,12100
EXT. MRS. KANE'S BOARDINGHOUSE - DAY - Kane Jr., seen from Kane Sr.'s position at the window. ,60700
He is advancing on the snowman, snowballs in his hands, dropping to one knee the better to confound his adversary. ,841
KANE If the rebels want a fight boys, let's give it to 'em! He throws two snowballs, missing widely, and gets up and advances another five feet before getting on his knees again. ,21600
KANE The terms are underconditional surrender. ,16
Up and at 'em! The Union forever! INT. PARLOR - MRS. KANE'S BOARDINGHOUSE - DAY - Kane Sr. closes the window. ,315000
THATCHER (over the boy's voice) Everything else - the principal as well as all monies earned - is to be administered by the bank in trust for your son, Charles Foster Kane, until his twenty-fifth birthday, at which time he is to come into complete possession. ,2420
Kane rises and goes to the window. ,1330000
MRS. KANE Go on, Mr. Thatcher. ,55800
Thatcher continues as she opens the window. ,433000
His voice, as before, is heard with overtones of the boy's. ,88600000
EXT. KANE'S BOARDINGHOUSE - DAY - Kane Jr., seen from Mrs. ,45500
Kane's position at the window. ,25600000
He is now within ten feet of the snowman, with one snowball left which he is holding back in his right hand. ,16500
KANE You can't lick Andy Jackson! Old Hickory, that's me! He fires his snowball, well wide of the mark and falls flat on his stomach, starting to crawl carefully toward the snowman. ,7310
THATCHER'S VOICE It's nearly five, Mrs. ,2610000
Kane, don't you think I'd better meet the boy - INT. PARLOR - MRS. KANE'S BOARDINGHOUSE - DAY - Mrs. ,132000
Kane at the window. ,6990000
Thatcher is now standing at her side. ,3110000
MRS. KANE I've got his trunk all packed - (she chokes a little) I've it packed for a couple of weeks - She can't say anymore. ,6110
She starts for the hall day. ,29000
Kane Sr., ill at ease, has no idea of how to comfort her. ,256000
THATCHER I've arranged for a tutor to meet us in Chicago. ,79400
I'd have brought him along with me, but you were so anxious to keep everything secret - He stops as he realizes that Mrs. ,20800
Kane has paid no attention to him and, having opened the door, is already well into the hall that leads to the side door of the house. ,88400
He takes a look at Kane Sr., tightens his lips and follows Mrs. ,638000
Kane. ,15100000
Kane, shoulders thrown back like one who bears defeat bravely, follows him. ,15100
EXT. MRS. KANE'S BOARDINGHOUSE - DAY - Kane, in the snow-covered field. ,350000
With the snowman between him and the house, he is holding the sled in his hand, just about to make the little run that prefaces a belly-flop. ,5130
The Kane house, in the background, is a dilapidated, shabby, two-story frame building, with a wooden outhouse. ,13800
Kane looks up as he sees the single file procession, Mrs. ,26800
Kane at its head, coming toward him. ,1930000
KANE H'ya, Mom. ,383000
Kane smiles. ,1730
KANE (gesturing at the snowman) See, Mom? ,3350
I took the pipe out of his mouth. ,482000
If it keeps on snowin', maybe I'll make some teeth and - MRS. KANE You better come inside, son. ,20300
You and I have got to get you all ready for - for - THATCHER Charles, my name is Mr. Thatcher - MRS. KANE This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles. ,6720
THATCHER How do you do, Charles? ,78900
KANE SR. He comes from the east. ,1240000
KANE Hello. ,4930
Hello, Pop. ,24900
KANE SR. Hello, Charlie! MRS. KANE Mr. Thatcher is going to take you on a trip with him tonight, Charles. ,14400
You'll be leaving on Number Ten. ,22400000
KANE SR. That's the train with all the lights. ,184000
KANE You goin', Mom? ,7550000
THATCHER Your mother won't be going right away, Charles - KANE Where'm I going? ,107000
KANE SR. You're going to see Chicago and New York - and Washington, maybe... ,1170000
Isn't he, Mr. Thatcher? ,4
THATCHER (heartily) He certainly is. ,3300000
I wish I were a little boy and going to make a trip like that for the first time. ,9280000
KANE Why aren't you comin' with us, Mom? ,58900
MRS. KANE We have to stay here, Charles. ,19300000
KANE SR. You're going to live with Mr. Thatcher from now on, Charlie! You're going to be rich. ,49800
Your Ma figures - that is, re - she and I have decided that this isn't the place for you to grow up in. ,445000
You'll probably be the richest man in America someday and you ought to - MRS. KANE You won't be lonely, Charles... ,34400
THATCHER We're going to have a lot of good times together, Charles... ,3270000
Really we are. ,23100000
Kane stares at him. ,7300000
THATCHER Come on, Charles. ,1430000
Let's shake hands. (extends his hand. ,173000
Charles continues to look at him) Now, now! I'm not as frightening as all that! Let's shake, what do you say? ,133000
He reaches out for Charles's hand. ,133000
Without a word, Charles hits him in the stomach with the sled. ,107000
Thatcher stumbles back a few feet, gasping. ,56000
THATCHER (with a sickly grin) You almost hurt me, Charles. (moves towards him) Sleds aren't to hit people with. ,2180
Sleds are to - to sleigh on. ,62800
When we get to New York, Charles, we'll get you a sled that will - He's near enough to try to put a hand on Kane's shoulder. ,42200
As he does, Kane kicks him in the ankle. ,402000
MRS. KANE Charles! He throws himself on her, his arms around her. ,23300
Slowly Mrs. ,3230
Kane puts her arms around him. ,2550000
KANE (frightened) Mom! Mom! MRS. KANE It's all right, Charles, it's all right. ,142000
Thatcher is looking on indignantly, occasionally bending over to rub his ankle. ,13600
KANE SR. Sorry, Mr. Thatcher! What the kid needs is a good thrashing! MRS. KANE That's what you think, is it, Jim? ,37100
KANE SR. Yes. ,980000
Kane looks slowly at Mr. Kane. ,4670000
MRS. KANE (slowly) That's why he's going to be brought up where you can't get at him. ,180000
DISSOLVE: 1870 - NIGHT (STOCK OR MINIATURE) Old-fashioned railroad wheels underneath a sleeper, spinning along the track. ,6570
DISSOLVE: INT. TRAIN - OLD-FASHIONED DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT - Thatcher, with a look of mingled exasperation, annoyance, sympathy and inability to handle the situation, is standing alongside a berth, looking at Kane. ,824
Kane, his face in the pillow, is crying with heartbreaking sobs. ,104000
KANE Mom! Mom! DISSOLVE OUT: The white page of the Thatcher manuscript. ,227000
We pick up the words: "HE WAS, I REPEAT, A COMMON ADVENTURER, SPOILED, UNSCRUPULOUS, IRRESPONSIBLE." The words are followed by printed headline on "Enquirer" copy (as in following scene). ,1890
INT. ENQUIRER CITY ROOM - DAY - Close-up on printed headline which reads: "ENEMY ARMADA OFF JERSEY COAST" Camera pulls back to reveal Thatcher holding the "Enquirer" copy, on which we read the headline. ,22400
He is standing near the editorial round table around which a section of the staff, including Reilly, Leland and Kane are eating lunch. ,67900
THATCHER (coldly) Is that really your idea of how to run a newspaper? ,12000
KANE I don't know how to run a newspaper, Mr. Thatcher. ,116000
I just try everything I can think of. ,76500000
THATCHER (reading headline of paper he is still holding) "Enemy Armada Off Jersey Coast." You know you haven't the slightest proof that this - this armada - is off the Jersey Coast. ,70
KANE Can you prove it isn't? ,204000
Bernstein has come into the picture. ,3990000
He has a cable in his hand. ,354000
He stops when he sees Thatcher. ,10100000
KANE Mr. Bernstein, Mr. Thatcher - BERNSTEIN How are you, Mr. Thatcher? ,90200
THATCHER How do you do? - BERNSTEIN We just had a wire from Cuba, Mr. Kane - (stops, embarrassed) KANE That's all right. ,5170
We have no secrets from our readers. ,180000
Mr. Thatcher is one of our most devoted readers, Mr. Bernstein. ,357000
He knows what's wrong with every issue since I've taken charge. ,2440000
What's the cable? ,2500000
BERNSTEIN (reading) The food is marvelous in Cuba the senoritas are beautiful stop I could send you prose poems of palm trees and sunrises and tropical colors blending in far off landscapes but don't feel right in spending your money for this stop there's no war in Cuba regards Wheeler. ,1160
THATCHER You see! There hasn't been a true word - KANE I think we'll have to send our friend Wheeler a cable, Mr. Bernstein. ,17200
Of course, we'll have to make it shorter than his, because he's working on an expense account and we're not. ,3070000
Let me see - (snaps his fingers) Mike! MIKE (a fairly tough customer prepares to take dictation, his mouth still full of food) Go ahead, Mr. Kane. ,35600
KANE Dear Wheeler - (pauses a moment) You provide the prose poems - I'll provide the war. ,18600
Laughter from the boys and girls at the table. ,80800
BERNSTEIN That's fine, Mr. Kane. ,31000
KANE I rather like it myself. ,189000
Send it right away. ,98800000
MIKE Right away. ,116000
BERNSTEIN Right away. ,9710000
Mike and Bernstein leave. ,1030000
Kane looks up, grinning at Thatcher, who is bursting with indignation but controls himself. ,12300
After a moment of indecision, he decides to make one last try. ,80900000
THATCHER I came to see you, Charles, about your - about the Enquirer's campaign against the Metropolitan Transfer Company. ,2660
KANE Won't you step into my office, Mr. Thatcher? ,324000
They cross the City Room together. ,498000
THATCHER I think I should remind you, Charles, of a fact you seem to have forgotten. ,18600
You are yourself one of the largest individual stockholders. ,16100000
INT. KANE'S OFFICE - DAY - Kane holds the door open for Thatcher. ,121000
They come in together. ,31700000
KANE Mr. Thatcher, isn't everything I've been saying in the Enquirer about the traction trust absolutely true? ,26400
THATCHER (angrily) They're all part of your general attack - your senseless attack - on everything and everybody who's got more than ten cents in his pocket. ,2600
They're - KANE The trouble is, Mr. Thatcher, you don't realize you're talking to two people. ,351000
Kane moves around behind his desk. ,421000
Thatcher doesn't understand, looks at him. ,3110000
KANE As Charles Foster Kane, who has eighty-two thousand, six hundred and thirty-one shares of Metropolitan Transfer - you see, I do have a rough idea of my holdings - I sympathize with you. ,735
Charles Foster Kane is a dangerous scoundrel, his paper should be run out of town and a committee should be formed to boycott him. ,2260
You may, if you can form such a committee, put me down for a contribution of one thousand dollars. ,379000
THATCHER (angrily) Charles, my time is too valuable for me - KANE On the other hand - (his manner becomes serious) I am the publisher of the Enquirer. ,281000
As such, it is my duty - I'll let you in on a little secret, it is also my pleasure - to see to it that decent, hard-working people of this city are not robbed blind by a group of money - mad pirates because, God help them, they have no one to look after their interests! I'll let you in on another little secret, Mr. Thatcher. ,2590
I think I'm the man to do it. ,147000000
You see, I have money and property - Thatcher doesn't understand him. ,27800000
KANE If I don't defend the interests of the underprivileged, somebody else will - maybe somebody without any money or any property and that would be too bad. ,22100
Thatcher glares at him, unable to answer. ,44
Kane starts to dance. ,1410000
KANE Do you know how to tap, Mr. Thatcher? ,126000
You ought to learn - (humming quietly, he continues to dance) Thatcher puts on his hat. ,7170
THATCHER I happened to see your consolidated statement yesterday, Charles. ,1490000
Could I not suggest to you that it is unwise for you to continue this philanthropic enterprise - (sneeringly) this Enquirer - that is costing you one million dollars a year? ,12200
KANE You're right. ,1240
We did lose a million dollars last year. ,2170000
Thatcher thinks maybe the point has registered. ,487000
KANE We expect to lost a million next year, too. ,1890000
You know, Mr. Thatcher - (starts tapping quietly) at the rate of a million a year - we'll have to close this place in sixty years. ,23000
DISSOLVE: INT. THE VAULT ROOM - THATCHER MEMORIAL LIBRARY - DAY Thompson - at the desk. ,253000
With a gesture of annoyance, he is closing the manuscript. ,38300
Camera arcs quickly around from over his shoulder to hold on door behind him, missing his face as he rises and turns to confront Miss Anderson, who has come into the room to shoo him out. ,882
Very prominent on this wall is an over-sized oil painting of Thatcher in the best Union League Club renaissance style. ,4850
MISS ANDERSON You have enjoyed a very rare privilege, young man. ,157000
Did you find what you were looking for? ,817000
THOMPSON No. Tell me something, Miss Anderson. ,52400000
You're not Rosebud, are you? ,18500000
MISS ANDERSON What? ,656000
THOMPSON I didn't think you were. ,20800000
Well, thanks for the use of the hall. ,216000
He puts his hat on his head and starts out, lighting a cigarette as he goes. ,251000
Miss Anderson, scandalized, watches him. ,650000
FADE OUT: FADE IN: INT. BERNSTEIN'S OFFICE - ENQUIRER SKYSCRAPER - DAY - Closeup of a still of Kane, aged about sixty-five. ,754
Camera pulls back, showing it is a framed photograph on the wall. ,586000
Over the picture are crossed American flags. ,3850000
Under it sits Bernstein, back of his desk. ,102000
Bernstein, always an undersized Jew, now seems even smaller than in his youth. ,12200
He is bald as an egg, spry, with remarkably intense eyes. ,12700
As camera continues to travel back, the back of Thompson's head and his shoulders come into the picture. ,65
BERNSTEIN (wryly) Who's a busy man? ,331
Me? I'm Chairman of the Board. ,2060000
I got nothing but time ... ,2040000
THOMPSON (still explaining) Well, Mr. Bernstein, you were with Mr. Kane from the very beginning - BERNSTEIN From before the beginning, young fellow. ,13800
And now it's after the end. (turns to Thompson) Anything you want to know about him - about the paper - THOMPSON - We thought maybe, if we can find out what he meant by that last word - as he was dying - BERNSTEIN That Rosebud? ,273
Maybe some girl? ,18000000
There were a lot of them back in the early days, and - THOMPSON Not some girl he knew casually and then remembered after fifty years, on his death bed - BERNSTEIN You're pretty young, Mr. - (remembers the name) Mr. Thompson. ,8890
A fellow will remember things you wouldn't think he'd remember. ,15800000
You take me. ,183000000
One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on a ferry and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in - (slowly) - and on it, there was a girl waiting to get off. ,31000
A white dress she had on - and she was carrying a white pastrol - and I only saw her for one second and she didn't see me at all - but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that girl. (triumphantly) See what I mean? (smiles) Well, so what are you doing about this "Rosebud," Mr. Thompson. ,9170
THOMPSON I'm calling on people who knew Mr. Kane. ,275000
I'm calling on you. ,18500000
BERNSTEIN Who else you been to see? ,54500000
THOMPSON Well, I went down to Atlantic City - BERNSTEIN Susie? ,125000
I called her myself the day after he died. ,6340000
I thought maybe somebody ought to... (sadly) She couldn't even come to the 'phone. ,2050000
THOMPSON You know why? ,100000000
She was so - BERNSTEIN Sure, sure. ,45700000
THOMPSON I'm going back there. ,80500000
BERNSTEIN Who else did you see? ,1650000
THOMPSON Nobody else, but I've been through that stuff of Walter Thatcher's. ,153000
That journal of his - BERNSTEIN Thatcher! That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met - THOMPSON He made an awful lot of money. ,538000
BERNSTEIN It's not trick to make an awful lot of money if all you want is to make a lot of money. (his eyes get reflective) Thatcher! Bernstein looks out of the window and keeps on looking, seeming to see something as he talks. ,639
BERNSTEIN He never knew there was anything in the world but money. ,1700000
That kind of fellow you can fool every day in the week - and twice on Sundays! (reflectively) The time he came to Rome for Mr. Kane's twenty-fifth birthday... ,24
You know, when Mr. Kane got control of his own money... ,30700
Such a fool like Thatcher - I tell you, nobody's business! DISSOLVE OUT: DISSOLVE IN: INT. BERNSTEIN'S OFFICE - DAY - Bernstein speaking to Thompson. ,28
BERNSTEIN He knew what he wanted, Mr. Kane did, and he got it! Thatcher never did figure him out. ,43700
He was hard to figure sometimes, even for me. ,38200000
Mr. Kane was a genius like he said. ,224000
He had that funny sense of humor. ,1040000
Sometimes even I didn't get the joke. ,2860000
Like that night the opera house of his opened in Chicago... ,2900000
You know, the opera house he built for Susie, she should be an opera singer... (indicates with a little wave of his hand what he thinks of that; sighing) That was years later, of course - 1914 it was. ,23300
Kane took the leading part in the opera, and she was terrible. ,1190000
But nobody had the nerve to say so - not even the critics. ,93100
Mr. Kane was a big man in those days. ,92100
But this one fellow, this friend of his, Branford Leland - He leaves the sentence up in the air, as we DISSOLVE: INT. CITY ROOM - CHICAGO ENQUIRER - NIGHT - It is late. ,28100
The room is almost empty. ,568000
Nobody is at work at the desks. ,3050000
Bernstein, fifty, is waiting anxiously with a little group of Kane's hirelings, most of them in evening dress with overcoats and hats. ,7270
Eveybody is tense and expectant. ,1180
CITY EDITOR (turns to a young hireling; quietly) What about Branford Leland? ,2780000
Has he got in his copy? ,118000
HIRELING Not yet. ,243000
BERNSTEIN Go in and ask him to hurry. ,15700
CITY EDITOR Well, why don't you, Mr. Bernstein? ,423000
You know Mr. Leland. ,147000000
BERNSTEIN (looks at him for a moment; then slowly) I might make him nervous. ,2130000
CITY EDITOR (after a pause) You and Leland and Mr. Kane - you were great friends back in the old days, I understand. ,37500
BERNSTEIN (with a smile) That's right. ,214000
They called us the "Three Musketeers." Somebody behind Bernstein has trouble concealing his laughter. ,15400
The City Editor speaks quickly to cover the situation. ,704000
CITY EDITOR He's a great guy - Leland. (another little pause) Why'd he ever leave New York? ,31000
BERNSTEIN (he isn't saying) That's a long story. ,1910000
ANOTHER HIRELING (a tactless one) Wasn't there some sort of quarrel between - BERNSTEIN (quickly) I had nothing to do with it. (then, somberly) It was Leland and Mr. Kane, and you couldn't call it a quarrel exactly. ,37
Better we should forget such things - (turning to City Editor) Leland is writing it up from the dramatic angle? ,209000
CITY EDITOR Yes. ,15100000
I thought it was a good idea. ,4500000
We've covered it from the news end, of course. ,76900000
BERNSTEIN And the social. ,7
How about the music notice? ,1040000
You got that in? ,94700000
CITY EDITOR Oh, yes, it's already made up. ,6640000
Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review. ,3000000
BERNSTEIN Enthusiastic? ,8
CITY EDITOR Yes, very! (quietly) Naturally. ,40800
BERNSTEIN Well, well - isn't that nice? ,49500
KANE'S VOICE Mr. Bernstein - Bernstein turns. ,182000
Medium long shot of Kane, now forty-nine, already quite stout. ,218000
He is in white tie, wearing his overcoat and carrying a folded opera hat. ,12100
BERNSTEIN Hello, Mr. Kane. ,217000
The Hirelings rush, with Bernstein, to Kane's side. ,603
Widespread, half-suppressed sensation. ,45700
CITY EDITOR Mr. Kane, this is a surprise! KANE We've got a nice plant here. ,257000
Everybody falls silent. ,49000
There isn't anything to say. ,7490000
KANE Was the show covered by every department? ,741000
CITY EDITOR Exactly according to your instructions, Mr. Kane. ,139000
We've got two spreads of pictures. ,10800000
KANE (very, very casually) And the notice? ,1770000
CITY EDITOR Yes - Mr. Kane. ,519000
KANE (quietly) Is it good? ,6800000
CITY EDITOR Yes, Mr. kane. ,519000
Kane looks at him for a minute. ,182000
CITY EDITOR But there's another one still to come - the dramatic notice. ,1960000
KANE (sharply) It isn't finished? ,41100
CITY EDITOR No, Mr. Kane. ,75800000
KANE That's Leland, isn't it? ,2480000
CITY EDITOR Yes, Mr. Kane. ,521000
KANE Has he said when he'll finish? ,3490000
CITY EDITOR We haven't heard from him. ,2570000
KANE He used to work fast - didn't he, Mr. Bernstein? ,4840000
BERNSTEIN He sure did, Mr. Kane. ,87300
KANE Where is he? ,7220000
The Hireling indicates the closed glass door of a little office at the other end of the City Room. ,28700
Kane takes it in. ,2450000
BERNSTEIN (helpless, but very concerned) MR. KANE - KANE That's all right, Mr. Bernstein. ,4070
Kane crosses the length of the long City Room to the glass door indicated before by the Hireling. ,26200
The City Editor looks at Bernstein. ,236000
Kane opens the door and goes into the office, closing the door behind him. ,421000
BERNSTEIN Leland and Mr. Kane - they haven't spoke together for ten years. (long pause; finally) Excuse me. (starts toward the door) INT. LELAND'S OFFICE - CHICAGO ENQUIRER - NIGHT - Bernstein comes in. ,522
An empty bottle is standing on Leland's desk. ,253000
He has fallen over his typewriter, his face on the keys. ,790000
A sheet of paper is in the machine. ,1090000
A paragraph has been typed. ,8380000
Kane is standing at the other side of the desk looking down on him. ,28000000
This is the first time we see murder in Kane's face. ,102000
Bernstein looks at Kane, then crosses to Leland. ,32100
He shakes him. ,2580
BERNSTEIN Hey, Brad! Brad! (he straightens, looks at Kane; pause) He ain't been drinking before, Mr. Kane. ,114000
We would have heard. ,439000
KANE (finally; after a pause) What does it say there? ,1450000
Bernstein stares at him. ,6190000
KANE What's he written? ,1650000
Bernstein looks over nearsightedly, painfully reading the paragraph written on the page. ,3550000
BERNSTEIN (reading) "Miss Susan Alexander, a pretty but hopelessly incompetent amateur - (he waits for a minute to catch his breath; he doesn't like it) - last night opened the new Chicago Opera House in a performance of - of -" (looks up miserably) I can't pronounce that name, Mr. Kane. ,1320
KANE Thais. ,48
Bernstein looks at Kane for a moment, then looks back, tortured. ,380000
BERNSTEIN (reading again) "Her singing, happily, is no concern of this department. ,17400
Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to..." (he continues to stare at the page) KANE (after a short silence) Go on! BERNSTEIN (without looking up) That's all there is. ,14400
Kane snatches the paper from the roller and reads it for himself. ,23600
Slowly, a queer look comes over his face. ,52200
Then he speaks, very quietly. ,1030000
KANE Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to say anything except that it represents a new low... (then sharply) Have you got that, Mr. Bernstein? ,10100
In the opinion of this reviewer - BERNSTEIN (miserably) I didn't see that. ,16000
KANE It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein. ,4270000
I'm dictating it. ,558000
BERNSTEIN (looks at him) I can't take shorthand. ,104000
KANE Get me a typewriter. ,6550000
I'll finish the notice. ,78500
Bernstein retreats from the room. ,214000
QUICK DISSOLVE OUT: QUICK DISSOLVE IN: INT. LELAND'S OFFICE - CHICAGO ENQUIRER - NIGHT - Long shot of Kane in his shirt sleeves, illuminated by a desk light, typing furiously. ,863
As the camera starts to pull even farther away from this, and as Bernstein - as narrator - begins to speak - QUICK DISSOLVE: INT. BERNSTEIN'S OFFICE - DAY - Bernstein speaking to Thompson. ,2910
BERNSTEIN He finished it. ,3
He wrote the worst notice I ever read about the girl he loved. ,272000
We ran it in every paper. ,3350000
THOMPSON (after a pause) I guess Mr. Kane didn't think so well of Susie's art anyway. ,964
BERNSTEIN (looks at him very soberly) He thought she was great, Mr. Thompson. ,950000
He really believed that. ,14800000
He put all his ambition on that girl. ,1940000
After she came along, he never really cared for himself like he used to. ,76800000
Oh, I don't blame Susie - THOMPSON Well, then, how could he write that roast? ,561
The notices in the Kane papers were always very kind to her. ,141000
BERNSTEIN Oh, yes. ,17700000
He saw to that. ,2030000
I tell you, Mr. Thompson, he was a hard man to figure out. ,130000
He had that funny sense of humor. ,969000
And then, too, maybe he thought by finishing that piece he could show Leland he was an honest man. ,185000
You see, Leland didn't think so. ,95700000
I guess he showed him all right. ,475000
He's a nice fellow, but he's a dreamer. ,7690000
They were always together in those early days when we just started the Enquirer. ,3790000
On these last words, we DISSOLVE: INT. CITY ROOM - ENQUIRER BUILDING - DAY - The front half of the second floor constitutes one large City Room. ,1540
Despite the brilliant sunshine outside, very little of it is actually getting into the room because the windows are small and narrow. ,3040000
There are about a dozen tables and desks, of the old-fashioned type, not flat, available for reporters. ,27800
Two tables, on a raised platform at the end of the room, obviously serve the city room executives. ,106000
To the left of the platform is an open door which leads into the Sanctrum. ,2920000
As Kane and Leland enter the room, an elderly, stout gent on the raised platform, strikes a bell and the other eight occupants of the room - all men - rise and face the new arrivals. ,3100
Carter, the elderly gent, in formal clothes, rises and starts toward them. ,106000
CARTER Welcome, Mr. Kane, to the "Enquirer." I am Herbert Carter. ,150000
KANE Thank you, Mr Carter. ,525000
This is Mr. Leland. ,11300000
CARTER (bowing) How do you do, Mr. Leland? ,915000
KANE (pointing to the standing reporters) Are they standing for me? ,195000
CARTER I thought it would be a nice gesture the new publisher - KANE (grinning) Ask them to sit down. ,29500
CARTER You may resume your work, gentlemen. (to Kane) I didn't know your plans and so I was unable to make any preparations. ,46000
KANE I don't my plans myself. ,6050000
They are following Carter to his raised platform. ,152000
KANE As a matter of fact, I haven't got any. ,90000
Except to get out a newspaper. ,1360000
There is a terrific crash at the doorway. ,12400
They all turn to see Bernstein sprawled at the entrance. ,960000
A roll of bedding, a suitcase, and two framed pictures were too much for him. ,115000
KANE Oh, Mr. Bernstein! Bernstein looks up. ,227000
KANE If you would come here a moment, please, Mr. Bernstein? ,948000
Bernstein rises and comes over, tidying himself as he comes. ,36400
KANE Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein. ,160000
Mr. Bernstein is my general manager. ,271000
CARTER (frigidly) How do you do, Mr. Bernstein? ,322
KANE You've got a private office here, haven't you? ,4660000
The delivery wagon driver has now appeared in the entrance with parts of the bedstead and other furniture. ,36600
He is looking about, a bit bewildered. ,38200000
CARTER (indicating open door to left of platform) My little sanctum is at your disposal. ,61800
But I don't think I understand - KANE I'm going to live right here. (reflectively) As long as I have to. ,215000
CARTER But a morning newspaper, Mr. Kane. ,83000
After all, we're practically closed twelve hours a day - except for the business offices - KANE That's one of the things I think must be changed, Mr. Carter. ,12300
The news goes on for twenty-four hours a day. ,210000
DISSOLVE: INT. KANE'S OFFICE - LATE DAY - Kane, in his shirt sleeves, at a roll-top desk in the Sanctum, is working feverishly on copy and eating a very sizeable meal at the same time. ,1230
Carter, still formally coated, is seated alongside him. ,18400
Leland, seated in a corner, is looking on, detached, amused. ,35200
The furniture has been pushed around and Kane's effects are somewhat in place. ,586000
On a corner of the desk, Bernstein is writing down figures. ,378000
No one pays any attention to him. ,75
KANE I'm not criticizing, Mr. Carter, but here's what I mean. ,241000
There's a front page story in the "Chronicle," (points to it) and a picture - of a woman in Brooklyn who is missing. ,156000
Probably murdered. (looks to make sure of the name) A Mrs. ,3410000
Harry Silverstone. ,1580
Why didn't the "Enquirer" have that this morning? ,10900000
CARTER (stiffly) Because we're running a newspaper, Mr. Kane, not a scandal sheet. ,6420
Kane has finished eating. ,107000
He pushes away his plates. ,1660000
KANE I'm still hungry, Brad. ,897000
Let's go to Rector's and get something decent. (pointing to the "Chronicle" before him) The "Chronicle" has a two-column headline, Mr. Carter. ,28500
Why haven't we? ,2040000
CARTER There is no news big enough. ,10300000
KANE If the headline is big enough, it makes the new big enough. ,1500000
The murder of Mrs. ,4580000
Harry Silverstone - CARTER (hotly) As a matter of fact, we sent a man to the Silverstone home yesterday afternoon. (triumphantly) Our man even arrived before the "Chronicle" reporter. ,1640000
And there's no proof that the woman was murdered - or even that she's dead. ,1910000
KANE (smiling a bit) The "Chronicle" doesn't say she's murdered, Mr. Carter. ,6160
It says the neighbors are getting suspicious. ,4720000
CARTER (stiffly) It's not our function to report the gossip of housewives. ,70800
If we were interested in that kind of thing, Mr. Kane, we could fill the paper twice over daily - KANE (gently) That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter. ,63100
Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone. ,4260000
Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the "Enquirer" will have him arrested. (he gets an idea) Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. ,14700
If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist. ,4590
Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear. ,1850000
CARTER Really, Mr. Kane, I can't see the function of a respectable newspaper - Kane isn't listening to him. ,1350
KANE Oh, Mr. Bernstein! Bernstein looks up from his figures. ,128000
KANE I've just made a shocking discovery. ,2790000
The "Enquirer" is without a telephone. ,5660000
Have two installed at once! BERNSTEIN I ordered six already this morning! Got a discount! Kane looks at Leland with a fond nod of his head at Bernstein. ,21400
Leland grins back. ,17300
Mr. Carter, meantime, has risen stiffly. ,83900
CARTER But, Mr. Kane - KANE That'll be all today, Mr. Carter. ,148000
You've been most understanding. ,88700
Good day, Mr. Carter! Carter, with a look that runs just short of apoplexy, leaves the room, closing the door behind him. ,34000
LELAND Poor Mr. Carter! KANE (shakes his head) What makes those fellows think that a newspaper is something rigid, something inflexible, that people are supposed to pay two cents for - BERNSTEIN (without looking up) Three cents. ,1010
KANE (calmly) Two cents. ,14200
Bernstein lifts his head and looks at Kane. ,152000
Kane gazes back at him. ,2
BERNSTEIN (tapping on the paper) This is all figured at three cents a copy. ,192000
KANE Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at two cents. ,138000
BERNSTEIN (sighs and puts papers in his pocket) All right, but I'll keep these figures, too, just in case. ,4710
KANE Ready for dinner, Brad? ,732000
BERNSTEIN Mr. Leland, if Mr. Kane, he should decide to drop the price to one cent, or maybe even he should make up his mind to give the paper away with a half-pound of tea - you'll just hold him until I get back, won't you? ,93
LELAND I'm not guaranteeing a thing, Mr. Bernstein. ,209000
You people work too fast for me! Talk about new brooms! BERNSTEIN Who said anything about brooms? ,89300
KANE It's a saying, Mr. Bernstein. ,163000
A new broom sweeps clean. ,122000
BERNSTEIN Oh! DISSOLVE: INT.PRIMITIVE COMPOSING AND PRESSROOM - NEW YORK ENQUIRER - NIGHT - The ground floor witht he windows on the street - of the "Enquirer." It is almost midnight by an old-fashioned clock on the wall. ,70
Grouped around a large table, on which are several locked forms of type, very old-fashioned of course, but true to the period - are Kane and Leland in elegant evening clothes, Bernstein, unchanged from the afternoon, and Smathers, the composing room foreman, nervous and harassed. ,1190
SMATHERS But it's impossible, Mr. Kane. ,61
We can't remake these pages. ,85500
KANE These pages aren't made up as I want them, Mr. Smathers. ,248000
We go to press in five minutes. ,84600000
CARTER (about to crack up) The "Enquirer" has an old and honored tradition, Mr. Kane... ,59700
The "Enquirer" is not in competition with those other rags. ,14000000
BERNSTEIN We should be publishing such rags, that's all I wish. ,1690000
Why, the "Enquirer" - I wouldn't wrap up the liver for the cat in the "Enquirer" - CARTER (enraged) Mr. Kane, I must ask you to see to it that this - this person learns to control his tongue. ,1360
Kane looks up. ,11500000
CARTER I've been a newspaperman my whole life and I don't intend - (he starts to sputter) - if it's your intention that I should continue to be harassed by this - this - (he's really sore) I warn you, Mr. Kane, it would go against my grain to desert you when you need me so badly - but I would feel obliged to ask that my resignation be accepted. ,30
KANE It is accepted, Mr. Carter, with assurances of my deepest regard. ,28800
CARTER But Mr. Kane, I meant - Kane turns his back on him, speaks again to the composing room foreman. ,1480
KANE (quietly) Let's remake these pages, Mr. Smathers. ,1780000
We'll have to publish a half hour late, that's all. ,1330000
SMATHERS (as though Kane were talking Greek) We can't remake them, Mr. Kane. ,4200000
We go to press in five minutes. ,84400000
Kane sighs, unperturbed, as he reaches out his hand and shoves the forms off the table onto the floor, where they scatter into hundreds of bits. ,1370
KANE You can remake them now, can't you, Mr. Smathers? ,209000
Smather's mouth opens wider and wider. ,10500
Bradford and Bernstein are grinning. ,16400
KANE After the types 've been reset and the pages have been remade according to the way I told you before, Mr. Smathers, kindly have proofs pulled and bring them to me. ,91
Then, if I can't find any way to improve them again - (almost as if reluctantly) - I suppose we'll have to go to press. ,615000
He starts out of the room, followed by Leland. ,44900000
BERNSTEIN (to Smathers) In case you don't understand, Mr. Smathers - he's a new broom. ,6060
DISSOLVE OUT: DISSOLVE IN: EXT. NEW YORK STREET - VERY EARLY DAWN - The picture is mainly occupied by a large building, on the roof of which the lights spell out the word "Enquirer" against the sunrise. ,6770
We do not see the street or the first few stories of this building, the windows of which would be certainly illuminated. ,527000
What we do see is the floor on which is located the City Room. ,6210000
Over this scene, newboys are heard selling the Chronicle, their voices growing in volume. ,18500
As the dissolve complete itself, camera moves toward the one lighted window - the window of the Sanctrum. ,5850
DISSOLVE: INT. KANE'S OFFICE - VERY EARLY DAWN - The newsboys are still heard from the street below - fainter but very insistent. ,1910
Kane's office is gas-lit, of course, as is the rest of the Enquirer building. ,77700
Kane, in his shirt sleeves, stands at the open window looking out. ,280000
The bed is already made up. ,2270000
On it is seated Bernstein, smoking the end of a cigar. ,495000
Leland is in a chair. ,3080000
NEWSBOYS' VOICES CHRONICLE! CHRONICLE! H'YA - THE CHRONICLE - GET YA! CHRONICLE! Kane, taking a deep breath of the morning air, closes the window and turns to the others. ,57500
The voices of the newsboys, naturally, are very much fainter after this. ,12500
LELAND We'll be on the street soon, Charlie - another ten minutes. ,778000
BERNSTEIN (looking at his watch) It's three hours and fifty minutes late - but we did it - Leland rises from the chair, stretching painfully. ,7280
KANE Tired? ,862
LELAND It's been a tough day. ,9720000
KANE A wasted day. ,195000
BERNSTEIN (looking up) Wasted? ,521000
LELAND (incredulously) Charlie?! BERNSTEIN You just made the paper over four times today, Mr. Kane. ,33
That's all - KANE I've changed the front page a little, Mr. Bernstein. ,361000
That's not enough - There's something I've got to get into this paper besides pictures and print - I've got to make the "New York Enquirer" as important to New York as the gas in that light. ,1080000
LELAND (quietly) What're you going to do, Charlie? ,77200000
Kane looks at him for a minute with a queer smile of happy concentration. ,38200
KANE My Declaration of Principles - (he says it with quotes around it) Don't smile, Brad - (getting the idea) Take dictation, Mr. Bernstein - BERNSTEIN Can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane - KANE I'll write it myself. ,21400
Kane grabs a piece of rough paper and a grease crayon. ,48400
Sitting down on the bed next to Bernstein, he starts to write. ,3860000
BERNSTEIN (looking over his shoulder) You don't wanta make any promises, Mr. Kane, you don't wanta keep. ,10600
KANE (as he writes) These'll be kept. (stops for a minute and reads what he has written; reading) I'll provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly. (starts to write again; reading as he writes) will also provide them - LELAND That's the second sentence you've started with "I" - KANE (looking up) People are going to know who's responsible. ,148000
And they're going to get the news - the true news - quickly and simply and entertainingly. (he speaks with real conviction) And no special interests will be allowed to interfere with the truth of that news. ,2960
He looks at Leland for a minute and goes back to his writing, reading as he writes. ,1640000
Bernstein has risen and crossed to one side of Kane. ,6110
They both stand looking out. ,57800000
Leland joins him on the other side. ,761000
Their three heads are silhouetted against the sky. ,455000
Leland's head is seen to turn slightly as he looks into Kane's face - camera very close on this - Kane turns to him and we know their eyes have met, although their faces are almost in sillhouette. ,650
Bernstein is still smoking a cigar. ,249000
DISSOLVE: Front page of the "Enquirer" shows big boxed editorial with heading: MY PRINCIPLES - A DECLARATION BY CHARLES FOSTER KANE Camera continues pulling back and shows newspaper to be on the top of a pile of newspapers. ,14700
As we draw further back, we see four piles, and as camera contines to pull back, we see six piles and go on back until we see a big field of "Enquirers" - piles of "Enquirers" - all 26,000 copies ready for distribution. ,657
A wagon with a huge sign on its side reading "ENQUIRER - CIRCULATION 26,000" passes through foreground, and we wipe to: A pile of "Enquirers" for sale on a broken down wooden box on a street corner, obviously a poor district. ,55
A couple of coins fall on the pile. ,322000
The stoop of a period door with old-fashioned enamel milk can and a bag of rolls. ,17000
Across the sidewalk before this, moves the shadow of an old-fashioned bicycle with an enormous front wheel. ,29200
A copy of the "Enquirer" is tossed on the stoop. ,218000
A breakfast table - beautiful linen and beautiful silver - everything very expensive, gleaming in the sunshine. ,149000
Into a silver newspaper rack there is slipped a copy of the "Enquirer". ,378000
Here, as before, the boxed editorial reading MY PRINCIPLES - A DECLARATION BY CHARLES FOSTER KANE, is very prominent on the front page. ,21900
The wooden floor of a railroad station, flashing light and dark as a train behind the camera rushes by. ,11000
On the floor, there is tossed a bound bundle of the "New York Enquirer" - the Declaration of Principles still prominent. ,134000
Rural Delivery - a copy of the "Enquirer"s being put into bins, showing state distribution. ,2410000
The railroad platform again. ,1650000
We stay here for four images. ,12300000
On each image, the speed of the train is faster and the piles of the "Enquirer" are larger. ,725000
On the first image, we move in to hold on the words "CIRCULATION - 31,000." We are this close for the next pile which reads 40,000; the next one which reads 55,000, and the last which is 62,000. ,39300
In each instance, the bundles of newspapers are thicker and the speed of the moving train behind the camera is increased. ,17000
The entire montage above indicated is accompanied by a descriptive complement of sound - the traffic noises of New York in the 1890's; wheels on cobblestones and horses' hooves; bicycle bells; the mooning of cattle and the crowing of roosters (in the RFD shot), and in all cases where the railroad platform is used - the mounting sound of the railroad train. ,12500
The last figure "62,000" opposite the word "CIRCULATION" on the "Enquirer" masthead changes to: EXT. STREET AND CHRONICLE BUIDING - DAY - Angle up to wall of building - a painter on a cradle is putting the last zero to the figure "62,000" on an enormous sign advertising the "Enquirer." It reads: THE ENQUIRER THE PEOPLE'S NEWSPAPER CIRCULATION 62,000 Camera travels down side of building - takes in another building on which there is a sign which reads: READ THE ENQUIRER AMERICA'S FINEST CIRCULATION 62,000 Camera continues to travel down to sidewalk in front of the Chronicle office. ,3
The Chronicle office has a plateglass window in which is reflected traffic moving up and down the street, also the figures of Kane, Leland and Bernstein, who are munching peanuts. ,21
Inside the window, almost filling it, is a large photograph of the "Chronicle" staff, with Reilly prominently seated in the center. ,42000
A sign over the photo reads: EDITORIAL AND EXECUTIVE STAFF OF THE NEW YORK CHRONICLE. A sign beneath it reads: GREATEST NEWSPAPER STAFF IN THE WORLD. The sign also includes the "Chronicle" circulation figure. ,57200
There are nine men in the photo. ,210000
BERNSTEIN (looking up at the sign - happily) Sixty-two thousand - LELAND That looks pretty nice. ,11500
KANE (indicating the Chronicle Building) Let's hope they like it there. ,2150000
BERNSTEIN From the Chronicle Building that sign is the biggest thing you can see - every floor guaranteed - let's hope it bothers them - it cost us enough. ,82600
KANE (pointing to the sign over the photograph in the window) Look at that. ,690000
LELAND The "Chronicle" is a good newspaper. ,172000
KANE It's a good idea for a newspaper. (reading the figures) Four hundred sixy thousand. ,20700
BERNSTEIN Say, with them fellows - (referring to the photo) - it's no trick to get circulation. ,75200
KANE You're right, Mr. Bernstein. ,108000
BERNSTEIN (sighs) You know how long it took the "Chronicle" to get that staff together? ,5800000
Twenty years. ,8040000
KANE I know. ,11300000
Kane, smiling, lights a cigarette, at the same time looking into the window. ,289000
Camera moves in to hold on the photograph of nine men, still holding the reflection of Kane's smiling face. ,25400
DISSOLVE: INT. CITY ROOM - THE ENQUIRER - NIGHT - Nine men, arrayed as in the photograph, but with Kane beaming in the center of the first row. ,1050
The men, variously with mustaches, beards, bald heads, etc. are easily identified as being the same men, Reilly prominent amongst them. ,3840
As camera pulls back, it is revealed that they are being photographed - by an old-type professional photographer, big box, black hood and all - in a corner of the room. ,15100
It is 1:30 at night. ,571000000
Desks, etc. have been pushed against the wall. ,18100
Running down the center of the room is a long banquet table, at which twenty diners have finished their meals. ,40600
The eleven remaining at their seats - these include Bernstein and Leland - are amusedly watching the photographic ceremonies. ,12100
PHOTOGRAPHER That's all. ,12100000
The photographic subjects rise. ,77800
KANE (a sudden thought) Make up an extra copy and mail it to the "Chronicle." Chuckling and beaming, he makes his way to his place at the head of the table. ,38300
The others have already sat down. ,15100000
Kane gets his guests' attention by rapping on the table with a knife. ,44000
KANE Gentlemen of the "Enquirer"! This has, I think, been a fitting welcome to those distinguished journalists - (indicates the eight men) Mr. Reilly in particular - who are the latest additions to our ranks. ,10900
It will make them happy to learn that the "Enquirer's" circulation this morning passed the two hundred thousand mark. ,107000
BERNSTEIN Two hundred and one thousand, six hundred and forty-seven. ,1480000
General applause. ,5860
KANE All of you - new and old - You're all getting the best salaries in town. ,257000
Not one of you has been hired because of his loyalty. ,2610000
It's your talent I'm interested in. ,3620000
That talent that's going to make the "Enquirer" the kind of paper I want - the best newspaper in the world! Applause. ,2870000
KANE However, I think you'll agree we've heard enough about newspapers and the newspaper business for one night. ,132000
There are other subjects in the world. ,6600000
He puts his two fingers in his mouth and lets out a shrill whistle. ,32800
This is a signal. ,12000000
A band strikes up a lively ditty of the period and enters in advance a regiment of very magnificent maidens, as daringly arrayed as possible in the chorus costumes of the day. ,10500
The rest of this episode will be planned and staged later. ,73300
Its essence is that Kane is just a healthy and happy young man having a wonderful time. ,869000
As some of the girls are detached from the line and made into partners for individual dancing - DISSOLVE OUT: DISSOLVE IN: THE "ENQUIRER" SIGN: THE ENQUIRER AMERICA'S FINEST CIRCULATION 274,321 Dissolve just completes itself - the image of Kane dancing with a girl on each arm just disappears as camera pans down off the Temple Bldg. in the same action as the previous street scene. ,74
There is a new sign on the side of the building below. ,47000000
It reads: READ THE ENQUIRER GREATEST STAFF IN THE WORLD Camera continues panning as we DISSOLVE: A montage of various scenes, between the years 1891-1900. ,3840
The scenes indicate the growth of the "Enquirer" under the impulse of Kane's personal drive. ,14200
Kane is shown, thus, at various activities: Move down from the sign: READ THE ENQUIRER GREATEST STAFF IN THE WORLD to street in front of saloon with parade passing (boys going off to the Spanish-American War)- A torchlight parade with the torches reflected in the glass window of the saloon - the sound of brass band playing "It's a Hot Time." In the window of the saloon is a large sign or poster "REMEMBER THE MAINE" INSERT: Remington drawing of American boys, similar to the parade above, in which "Our Boys" in the expeditionary hats are seen marching off to war. ,1810
Back of observation car. ,71600
Shot of Kane congratulating Teddy Roosevelt (the same shot as in the News Digest - without flickering). ,1980
The wooden floor of the railroad platform again - a bundle of "Enquirers" - this time an enormous bundle - is thrown down, and the moving shadows of the train behind the camera indicate that it is going like a bat out of hell. ,2170
A reproduction of Kane and Teddy shaking hands as above is very prominent in the frame and almost hogs the entire front page. ,7870
The headline indicates the surrender of Cuba. ,12400
INT. ENQUIRER OFFICE Cartoon, highly dramatic and very involved as to content - lousy with captions, labels, and symbolic figures, the most gruesome and recognizable - "Capitalistic Greed." This cartoon is almost finished and is on a drawing board before which stand Kane and the artist himself. ,966
Kane is grinning over some suggestion he has made. ,2230000
DISSOLVE: The cartoon finished and reproduced on the editorial page of the "Enquirer" - in quite close, with an editorial and several faces of caps shown underneath. ,6840
The entire newspaper is crushed with an angry gesture and thrown down into an expensive-looking wastebasket (which is primarily for ticker tape) tape is pouring. ,19700
INT. ENQUIRER OFFICE Cartoonist and Kane working on comic strip of "Johnny the Monk." DISSOLVE: Floor of room - Two kids on floor, with newspaper spread out, looking at the same comic strip. ,835
Kane's photographic gallery with photographers, stooges, and Kane himself in attendance on a very hot-looking item of the period. ,1440
A sob sister is interviewing this hot number and Kane is arranging her dress to look more seductive. ,4460
DISSOLVE OUT: DISSOLVE IN: The hot number reproduced and prominently displayed and covering almost half a page of the "Enquirer." It is being read in a barber shop and is seen in an over-shoulder shot of the man who is reading it. ,3980
He is getting a shine, a manicure, and a haircut. ,3390000
The sob-sister caption over the photograph reveals: "I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING, SAYS DANCER. EVERYTHING WENT RED." An oval photograph of the gun is included in the lay- out of the pretty lady with a headline which says: "DEATH GUN." STREET - SHOT OF BUCKET BRIGADE Shot of Kane, in evening clothes, in obvious position of danger, grabbing camera from photographer. ,41
Before him rages a terrific tenement fire. ,15800
DISSOLVE: INSERT: Headline about inadequacy of present fire equipment. ,12200
DISSOLVE: Final shot of a new horse-drawn steam engine roaring around a street corner (Stock). ,6060
DISSOLVE: A black pattern of iron bars. ,237000
We are in a prison cell. ,1740000
The door is opened and a condemned man, with priest, warden and the usual attendants, moves into foreground and starts up the hall past a group which includes phtographers, Kane's sob- sister, and Kane. ,821
The photographers take pictures with a mighty flash of old-fashioned flash powder. ,2140000
The condemned man in the foreground (in silhouette) is startled by this. ,6300
DISSOLVE: A copy of the "Enquirer" spread out on a table. ,2380000
A big lay-out of the execution story includes the killer as photographed by Kane's photographers, and nearby on the other page there is a large picture of the new steam fire engine (made from the stock shot) with a headline indicating that the "Enquirer" has won its campaign for better equipment. ,15500
A cup of coffee and a doughnut are on the newspaper, and a servant girl - over whose shoulder we see the paper - is stirring the coffee. ,8430
The Beaux Art Ball. ,3670000
A number of elderly swells are jammed into a hallway. ,236000
Servants suddenly divest them of their furs, overcoats and wraps, revealing them to be in fancy dress costume, pink fleshings, etc., the effect to be very surprising, very lavish and very very ridiculous. ,5950
We see, among others, Mr. Thatcher himself (as Ben Hur) ribbon around, his bald head and all. ,10000
At the conclusion of this tableau, the image freezes and we pull back to show it reproduced on the society page of the "New York Enquirer." Over the "Enquirer"'s pictorial version of the Beaux Art Ball is thrown a huge fish - then coffee grounds - altogether a pretty repulsive sight. ,1000
The whole thing is bundled up and thrown into a garbage can. ,407000
Extreme close-up of the words: "OCCUPATION - JOUNALIST." Camera pulls back to show passport open to the photograph page which shows Kane, registering birth, race, and nationality. ,263
Passport cover is closed, showing it to be an American passport. ,3650000
EXT. CUNARD DOCKS - GANGPLANK AND DECK OF BOAT - NIGHT - As camera pulls back over shoulder of official, taking in Kane, Leland, and Bernstein, we see the bustle and noise of departing ocean liner. ,428
Behind the principles can be seen an enormous plain sign which reads: "FIRST CLASS." From offstage can be heard the steward's cry, indispensable in any Mercury production, the old familiar cry, "All Ashore That's Going Ashore!" - gongs, also blasts of the great whistle and all the rest of it. ,63
THE OFFICIAL There you are, Mr. Kane. ,84900000
Everything in order. ,2330000
KANE Thank you. ,11500000
Kane and Leland and Bernstein start up the gangplank. ,14600
THE OFFICIAL (calling) Have a good rest, Mr. Kane. ,170000
KANE Thanks. ,5860
BERNSTEIN But please, Mr. Kane, don't buy any more paintings. ,41600000
Nine Venuses already we got, twenty-six Virgins - two whole warehouses full of stuff - KANE I promise not to bring any more Venuses and not to worry - and not to try to get in touch with any of the papers - STEWARD'S VOICE All ashore! KANE - and to forget about the new feature sections - and not to try to think up and ideas for comic sections. ,44
STEWARD'S VOICE All ashore that's going ashore! Kane leaves Leland and Bernstein midway up gangplank, as he rushes up to it, calling back with a wave: KANE Goodbye, gents! (at the top of the gangplank, he turns and calls down) Hey! KANE (calling down to them) You don't expect me to keep any of those promises, do you? ,15
A band on deck strikes up "Auld Lang Syne." Bernstein and Leland turn to each other. ,12000
BERNSTEIN Do you, Mr. Leland? ,913000
LELAND (smiling) Certainly not. ,12300
They start down the gangplank together. ,66500
DISSOLVE: LONG SHOT OF THE ENQUIRER BUILDING - NIGHT The pattern of telegraph wires, dripping with rain, through which we see the same old building but now rendered fairly remarkable by tremendous outline sign in gold which reads "THE NEW YORK DAILY ENQUIRER." A couple of lights show in the building. ,768
We start toward the window where the lights show, as we - DISSOLVE: EXT. OUTSIDE THE WINDOW AT BERNSTEIN'S DESK - NIGHT The light in the window in the former shot was showing behind the letter "E" of the Enquirer sign. ,12700
Now the letter "E" is even larger than the frame of the camera. ,592000
Rain drips disconsolately off the middle part of the figure. ,1110000
We see through this and through the drizzle of the window to Bernstein's desk where he sits working under a blue shaded light. ,4100
DISSOLVE OUT: DISSOLVE IN: Same setup as before except that it is now late afternoon and late in the winter of the year. ,39000
The outline "E" is hung with icicles which are melting, dripping despairingly between us and Mr. Bernstein, still seated at his desk - still working. ,1270000
DISSOLVE: Same setup as before except that it is spring. ,5550000
Instead of the sad sounds of dripping rain or dripping icicles, we hear the melancholy cry of a hurdy-gurdy in the street below. ,6040
It is spring and through the letter "E" we can see Bernstein working at his desk. ,1280000
Pigeons are gathering on the "E" and on the sill. ,18900
Bernstein looks up and sees them. ,841000
He takes some crumbs from his little homemade lunch which is spread out on the desk before him, carries them to the windows and feeds the pigeons, looking moodily out on the prospect of spring on Park Row. ,80
The birds eat the crumbs - the hurdy-gurdy continues to play. ,13200
DISSOLVE: The same setup again, it is now summer. ,5230000
The window was half- open before .. now it's open all the way and Bernstein has gone so far as to take off his coat. ,204000
His shirt and his celluloid collar are wringing wet. ,32600
Camera moves toward the window to tighten on Bernstein and to take in the City Room behind him, which is absolutely deserted. ,9200
It is clear that there is almost nothing more for Bernstein to do. ,79600000
The hurdy- gurdy in the street is playing as before, but a new tune. ,34500
DISSOLVE: A beach on Coney Island. ,19200
Bernstein in a rented period bathing suit sits alone in the sand, reading a copy of the "Enquirer." DISSOLVE OUT: DISSOLVE IN: INT. CITY ROOM - ENQUIRER BUILDING - DAY - The whole floor is now a City Room. ,591
It is twice its former size, yet not too large for all the desks and the people using them. ,43800
The windows have been enlarged, providing a good deal more light and air. ,3340000
A wall calendar says September 9th. ,127000
Kane and Bernstein enter and stand in the entrance a moment. ,534000
Kane, who really did look a bit peaked before, is now clear- eyed and tanned. ,3630
He is wearing new English clothes. ,3630000
As they come into the room, Bernstein practically walking sideways, is doing nothing but beaming and admiring Kane, quelling like a mother at the Carnegie Hall debut of her son. ,21
Seeing and recognizing Kane, the entire staff rises to its feet. ,10900
KANE (referring to the staff; with a smile) Ask them to sit down, Mr. Bernstein. ,23900000
BERNSTEIN Sit down, everybody - for heaven's sake! The order is immediately obeyed, everybody going into business of feverish activity. ,12000
BERNSTEIN So then, tonight, we go over everything thoroughly, eh? ,9600000
Especially the new papers - KANE We certainly do. ,1110000
Vacation's over - starting right after dinner. ,585000
KANE I mean I've got a job for you. ,67900
LELAND Good. ,50000
LELAND (sincerely, but not gushing; seriously) I'd like that. ,120000
You get tickets. ,300000
You won't miss anything. ,300000
Slight pause. ,280000
They continue on their way. ,210000
He wanted you to. ,300000
Most of the time? ,260000
BERNSTEIN Yes. ,110000
You always have been. ,290000
The Majestic. ,300000
I got the reservations. ,20000
That's why he went into politics. ,20000
It seems we weren't enough. ,20000
He wanted all the voters to love him, too. ,20000
All he really wanted out of life was love. ,30000
You see, he just didn't have any to give. ,30000
He loved Charlie Kane, of course, very dearly - and his mother, I guess he always loved her. ,20000
KANE Thanks. ,190000
Good day. ,280000
KANE All right. ,30000
The gun is shot. ,160000
Emily rises. ,20000
I can't help that. ,300000
LELAND What? ,70000
KANE Go ahead. ,20000
A door opens. ,280000
The boys crowd around. ,30000
An uncomfortable pause. ,210000
Besides, you never get drunk. ,20000
I told you that. ,250000
Remember the working man? ,20000
LELAND Yes. ,30000
Still silence. ,300000
He - He stops. ,30000
Darling!... ,290000
Darling, it's all right... ,90000
Mother's here. ,150000
Reilly goes on. ,160000
Kane is very pleased. ,30000
Wonderful. ,300000
BERNSTEIN I do. ,30000
I could hear every word. ,230000
ANOTHER HIRELING Right in there, Mr. Kane. ,1
But right now - that lady over there - (he indicates a woman at the desk) - that's the new society editor, I take it? ,308000
You think I could interrupt her a moment, Mr. Bernstein? ,2690000
BERNSTEIN Huh? ,37
Oh, I forgot - you've been away so long I forgot about your joking - He trails after Kane as he approaches the Society Editor's desk. ,27300
The Society Editor, a middle-aged spinster, sees him approaching and starts to quake all over, but tries to pretend she isn't aware of him. ,65900
An envelope in her hand shakes violently. ,37100
Kane and Bernstein stop at her desk. ,249000
BERNSTEIN Miss Townsend - Miss Townsend looks up and is so surprised to see Bernstein with a stranger. ,12800
MISS TOWNSEND Good afternoon, Mr. Bernstein. ,161000
BERNSTEIN This is Mr. Kane, Miss Townsend. ,18400
Miss Townsend can't stick to her plan. ,3070000
She starts to rise, but her legs are none too good under her. ,2480000
She knocks over a tray of copy paper as she rises, and bends to pick it up. ,8790
KANE (very hesitatingly and very softly) Miss Townsend - At the sound of his voice, she straightens up. ,8100
She is very close to death from excitement. ,940000
KANE I've been away for several months, and I don't know exactly how these things are handled now. ,65100
But one thing I wanted to be sure of is that you won't treat this little announcement any differently than you would any other similar announcement. ,158000
He hands her an envelope. ,916000
She has difficulty in holding on to it. ,4720000
KANE (gently) Read it, Miss Townsend. ,172000
And remember - just the regular treatment! See you at nine o'clock, Mr. Bernstein! Kane leaves. ,29100
Bernstein looks after him, then at the paper. ,106000
Miss Townsend finally manages to open the envelope. ,628000
A piece of flimsy paper, with a few written lines, is her reward. ,2790000
MISS TOWNSEND (reading) Mr. and Mrs. ,4750000
Thomas Moore Norton announce the engagement of their daughter, Emily Monroe Norton, to Mr. Charles Foster Kane. ,3260
BERNSTEIN (starts to read it) Mr. and Mrs. ,52900
Thomas Moore Norton announce - MISS TOWNSEND (fluttering - on top of him) She's - she's the niece of - of the President of the United States - BERNSTEIN (nodding proudly) know. ,56
Come on, Miss Townsend - From the window, maybe we can get a look. ,259000
He takes her by the hand and leads her off. ,16900000
Angle toward open window. ,23000
Bernstein and Miss Townsend, backs to camera, rushing to the window. ,45500
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE ENQUIRER BUILDING - DAY - High angle downward - what Bernstein and Miss Townsend see from the window. ,13400
Kane is just stepping into an elegant barouch, drawn up at the curb, in which sits Miss Emily Norton. ,10200
He kisses her full on the lips before he sits down. ,5860000
She acts a bit taken aback, because of the public nature of the scene, but she isn't really annoyed. ,3860
As the barouche starts off, she is looking at him adoringly. ,35900
He, however, has turned his head and is looking adoringly at the "Enquirer." He apparently sees Bernstein and Miss Townsed and waves his hand. ,28800
INT. CITY ROOM - ENQUIRER - DAY - Bernstein and Miss Townsend at window. ,52300
BERNSTEIN A girl like that, believe me, she's lucky! Presiden't niece, huh! Say, before he's through, she'll be a Presiden't wife. ,2290
Miss Townsend is now dewey-eyed. ,1030000
She looks at Bernstein, who has turned away, gazing down at the departing couple. ,2250000
DISSOLVE: Front page of the "Enquirer." Large picture of the young couple - Kane and Emily - occupying four columns - very happy. ,4340
DISSOLVE: INT. BERNSTEIN'S OFFICE - ENQUIRER - DAY - Bernstein and Thompson. ,1970000
As the dissolve comes, Bernstein's voice is heard. ,1050000
BERNSTEIN The way things turned out, I don't need to tell you - Miss Emily Norton was no rosebud! THOMPSON It didn't end very well, did it? ,28100
BERNSTEIN (shaking his head) It ended - (a slight pause) Then there was Susie - that ended, too. (shrugs, a pause; then looking up into Thompson's eyes) guess he didn't make her very happy - (A PAUSE) You know, I was thinking - that Rosebud you're trying to find out about - THOMPSON Yes - BERNSTEIN Maybe that was something he lost. ,505
Mr. Kane was a man that lost - almost everything he had - (a pause) You ought to talk to Bradford Leland. ,2870
He could tell you a lot. ,5620000
I wish I could tell you where Leland is, but I don't know myself. ,3510000
He may be out of town somewhere - he may be dead. ,44700
THOMPSON In case you'd like to know, Mr. Bernstein, he's at the Huntington Memorial Hospital on 180th Street. ,43300
BERNSTEIN You don't say! Why I had no idea - THOMPSON Nothing particular the matter with him, they tell me. ,15300000
Just - (controls himself) BERNSTEIN Just old age. (smiles sadly) It's the only disease, Mr. Thompson, you don't look forward to being cured of. (pauses) You ought to see Mr. Leland. ,781
There's a whole lot of things he could tell you - if he wanted to. ,287000
FADE OUT: FADE IN: EXT. HOSPITAL ROOF - DAY - Close shot - Thompson. ,62500
He is tilted back in a chair which seems to be, and is, leaning against a chimney. ,216000
Leland's voice is heard for a few moments before Leland is seen. ,1330000
LELAND'S VOICE When you get to my age, young man, you don't miss anything. ,1350000
Unless maybe it's a good drink of bourbon. ,2360000
Even that doesn't make much difference, if you remember there hasn't been any good bourbon in this country for twenty years. ,223000
Camera has pulled back, during above speech, revealing that Leland, wrapped in a blanket, is in a wheel chair, talking to Thompson. ,48800
They are on the flat roof of a hospital. ,341000
Other people in wheel chairs can be seen in the background, along with a nurse or two. ,323000
They are all sunning themselves. ,131000
THOMPSON Mr. Leland, you were - LELAND You don't happen to have a cigar, do you? ,54800
I've got a young physician - must remember to ask to see his license - the odds are a hundred to one he hasn't got one - who thinks I'm going to stop smoking... ,23800
I changed the subject, didn't I? ,142000
Dear, dear! What a disagreeable old man I've become. ,2010000
You want to know what I think of Charlie Kane? ,602000
Well - I suppose he has some private sort of greatness. ,1680000
But he kept it to himself. (grinning) He never - gave himself away - He never gave anything away. ,2470000
He just - left you a tip. ,464000
He had a generous mind. ,2630000
I don't suppose anybody ever had so many opinions. ,58600
That was because he had the power to express them, and Charlie lived on power and the excitement of using it - But he didn't believe in anything except Charlie Kane. ,417000
He never had a conviction in his life. ,1340000
I guess he died without one - That must have been pretty unpleasant. ,229000
Of course, a lot of us check out with no special conviction about death. ,13200000
But we do know what we're leaving ... we believe in something. (looks sharply at Thompson) You're absolutely sure you haven't got a cigar? ,8220
THOMPSON Sorry, Mr. Leland. ,2190000
LELAND Never mind - Bernstein told you about the first days at the office, didn't he? ,454000
Well, Charlie was a bad newspaper man even then. ,51800
He entertained his readers, but he never told them the truth. ,446000
THOMPSON Maybe you could remember something that - LELAND I can remember everything. ,491000
That's my curse, young man. ,50700
It's the greatest curse that's ever been inflicted on the human race. ,446000
Memory - I was his oldest friend. (slowly) As far as I was concerned, he behaved like swine. ,5360
Maybe I wasnt' his friend. ,519000
If I wasn't, he never had one. ,3450000
Maybe I was what nowadays you call a stooge - DISSOLVE OUT: DISSOLVE IN: INT. CITY ROOM - THE ENQUIRER - NIGHT - The party (previously shown in the Bernstein sequence). ,3020
We start this sequence toward the end of the former one, but from a fresh angle, holding on Leland, who is at the end of the table. ,20300
Kane is heard off, making a speech. ,527000
KANE'S VOICE Not one of you has been hired because of his loyalty. ,45400
During above, Bernstein has come to Leland's side. ,150000
BERNSTEIN Isn't it wonderful? ,3980000
Such a party! LELAND Yes. ,214000
His tone causes Bernstein to look at him. ,1030000
KANE'S VOICE However, I think you'll agree we've heard enough about newspapers and the newspaper business for one night. ,2020
The above speeches are heard under the following dialogue. ,2230000
BERNSTEIN (to Leland) What's the matter? ,38800000
LELAND Mr. Bernstein, these men who are now with the "Enquirer" - who were with the "Chronicle" until yesterday - weren't they just as devoted to the "Chronicle" kind of paper as they are now to - our kind of paper? ,92
BERNSTEIN Sure. ,16500
They're like anybody else. ,39600
They got work to do. ,30900000
They do it. (proudly) Only they happen to be the best men in the business. ,3630000
KANE (finishing his speech) There are other subjects in the world - Kane whistles. ,33200
The band and the chorus girls enter and hell breaks loose all around Leland and Bernstein. ,59300
LELAND (after a minute) Do we stand for the same things that the "Chronicle" stands for, Mr. Bernstein? ,429000
BERNSTEIN (indignantly) Certainly not. ,25600
So what's that got to do with it? ,82200
Mr. Kane, he'll have them changed to his kind of newspapermen in a week. ,30500
LELAND Probably. ,1070
There's always a chance, of course, that they'll change Mr. Kane - without his knowing it. ,1210000
Kane has come up to Leland and Bernstein. ,4270000
He sits down next to them, lighting a cigarette. ,4360000
KANE Well, gentlemen, are we going to war? ,853000
LELAND Our readers are, anyway, I don't know about the rest of the country. ,13500000
KANE (enthusiastically) It'll be our first foreign war in fifty years, Brad. ,37200
We'll cover it the way the "Hickville Gazette" covers the church social! The names of everybody there; what they wore; what they ate; who won the prizes; who gave the prizes - (gets excited) I tell you, Brad, I envy you. (quoting) By Bradford Leland, the "Enquirer's" Special Correspondent at the Front. ,681
I'm almost tempted - LELAND But there is no Front, Charlie. ,17400
There's a very doubtful civil war. ,131000
Besides, I don't want the job. ,115000000
KANE All right, Brad, all right - you don't have to be a war correspondent unless you want to - I'd want to. (looking up) Hello, Georgie. ,28300
Georgie, a very handsome madam has walked into the picture, stands behind him. ,4210
She leans over and speaks quietly in his ear. ,761000
GEORGIE Is everything the way you want it, dear? ,53500000
KANE (looking around) If everybody's having fun, that's the way I want it. ,73400
GEORGIE I've got some other little girls coming over - LELAND (interrupting) Charles, I tell you there is no war! There's a condition that should be remedied - but between that and a - KANE (seriously) How would the "Enquirer" look with no news about this non-existent war - with Benton, Pulitzer and Heart devoting twenty columns a day to it? ,777
LELAND They do it only because you do! KANE (grins) And I do it because they do it, and they do it - it's a vicious circle, isn't it? (rises) I'm going over to Georgie's, Brad - you know, Georgie, don't you? ,915
Leland nods. ,27
GEORGIE (over Kane's next lines) Glad to meet you, Brad. ,47400
Leland shudders. ,139
KANE I told you about Brad, Georgie. ,165000
He needs to relax. ,114000
Brad doesn't answer. ,2900000
KANE Some ships with wonderful wines have managed to slip through the enemy fleet that's blockading New York harbor - (grins) Georgie knows a young lady whom I'm sure you'd adore - wouldn't he, Georgie? ,51
Why only the other evening I said to myself, if Brad were only here to adore this young lady - this - (snaps his fingers) What's her name again? ,6470
DISSOLVE OUT: DISSOLVE IN: INT. GEORGIE'S PLACE - NIGHT - Georgie is introducing a young lady to Branford Leland. ,799
On sound track we hear piano music. ,1170000
GEORGIE (right on cue from preceding scene) Ethel - this gentlemen has been very anxious to meet you - This is Ethel. ,2600
ETHEL Hello, Mr. Leland. ,208000
Camera pans to include Kane, seated at piano, with girls gathered around him. ,28800
ONE OF THE GIRLS Charlie! Play the song about you. ,6230000
ANOTHER GIRL Is there a song about Charlie? ,76300
Kane has broken into "Oh, Mr. Kane!" and Charlie and the girls start to sing. ,325000
Ethel leads the unhappy Leland over to the group. ,562000
Kane, seeing Leland and taking his eye, motions to the professor who has been standing next to him to take over. ,58000
The professor does so. ,2240000
The singing continues. ,2010000
Kane rises and crosses to Leland. ,404000
KANE Say, Brad. (draws him slightly aside) I've got an idea. ,522000
LELAND Yes? ,47800
KANE You don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic? ,399000
Kane starts quietly to dance in time to the music. ,1230000
Leland smiles at him. ,96500
KANE You start tomorrow night. ,489000
Richard Carl in "The Spring Chicken." (or supply show) I'll get us some girls. ,249000
A drama critic gets them free, you know. (grins) Rector's at seven? ,206000
LELAND Charlie - KANE Yes? ,415000
LELAND (still smiling) It doesn't make any difference about me, but one of these days you're going to find out that all this charm of yours won't be enough - KANE (has stopped dancing) You're wrong. ,47800
It does make a difference to you - Rector's, Brad? (starts to dance again) Come to think of it, I don't blame you for not wanting to be a war correspondent. ,40200
It isn't much of a war. ,28600000
Besides, they tell me there isn't a decent restaurant on the whole island. ,7890000
DISSOLVE OUT: DISSOLVE IN: INT. RECTOR'S - NIGHT - Leland, Kane, two young ladies at Rector's. ,10200
Popular music is heard over the soundtrack. ,2750000
Everybody is laughing very, very hard at something Kane has said. ,951000
The girls are hysterical. ,598000
Kane can hardly breathe. ,585000
As Leland's laughter becomes more and more hearty, it only increases the laughter of the others. ,40200
DISSOLVE: EXT. CUNARD LOCKS - GANGPLANK AND DECK OF BOAT - NIGHT - As told by Bernstein. ,7710
Kane is calling down to Leland and Bernstein (as before). ,48000
KANE You don't expect me to keep any of those promises, do you? ,5610000
A band on deck strikes up "Auld Lang Syne" and further ship-to- shore conversation is rendered unfeasible. ,12000
Bernstein and Leland on deck. ,153000
BERNSTEIN (turns to Leland) Do you, Mr. Leland? ,226000
BERNSTEIN Mr. Leland, why didn't you go to Europe with him? ,140000
He said to me just yesterday - LELAND I wanted him to have fun - and with me along - This stops Bernstein. ,1180000
Bernstein looks at him. ,8480000
LELAND Mr. Bernstein, I wish you'd let me ask you a few questions, and answer me truthfully. ,59400
BERNSTEIN Don't I always? ,2530000
LELAND Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt? ,346000
Am I a horse-faced hypocrite? ,74100
Am I a New England school-marm? ,864000
Leland is surprised. ,10300000
BERNSTEIN If you thought I'd answer different from what Mr. Kane tells you - well, I wouldn't. ,1850000
LELAND (good naturedly) You're in a conspiracy against me, you two. ,8120000
BERNSTEIN Against me there should be such a conspiracy some time! He pauses. "Auld Lang Syne" can still be heard from the deck of the department steamer. ,1670
BERNSTEIN (with a hopeful look in his eyes) Well, he'll be coming back in September. ,39600
It gets in on the ninth. ,1730000
LELAND September the ninth? ,13400000
Leland puts his hand in his pocket, pulls out a pencil and small engagement book, opens the book and starts to write. ,29100
Leland's pencil writing on a page in the engagement book open to September 9: "Rector's - 8:30 p.m." DISSOLVE: Front page "Enquirer." Large picture of the young couple - Kane and Emily - occupying four columns - very happy. ,2000
EXT. HOSPITAL ROOF - DAY - Leland and Thompson. ,138000
Leland is speaking as we dissolve. ,486000
LELAND I used to go to dancing school with her. ,16900000
Thompson had handed Leland a paper. ,22500
LELAND What's this? ,5500000
THOMPSON It's a letter from her lawyers. ,313000
LELAND (reading aloud from the letter) David, Grobleski & Davis - My dear Rawlston - (looks up) THOMPSON Rawlston is my boss. ,564000
LELAND Oh, yes. ,21500000
I know about Mr. Rawlston. ,20700
THOMPSON He knows the first Mrs. ,249000
Kane socially - That's the answer we got. ,162000
LELAND (reading) I am in receipt of your favor of yesterday. ,13700
I beg you to do me the courtesy of accepting my assurance that Mrs. ,79600
Whitehall cannot be induced to contribute any more information on the career of Charles Foster Kane. ,44400
She has authorized me to state on previous occasions that she regards their brief marriage as a distateful episode in her life that she prefers to forget. ,7340
With assurances of the highest esteem - Leland hands the paper back to Thompson. ,48200
LELAND Brief marriage! Ten years! (sighs) THOMPSON Was he in love? ,23100
LELAND He married for love - (a little laugh) That's why he did everything. ,10200000
That's Charlie's story - it's the story of how he lost it. ,83300000
As for Emily - well, all I can tell you is Emily's story as she told it to me, which probably isn't fair - there's supposed to be two sides to every story - and I guess there are. ,83100
I guess there's more than two sides - DISSOLVE OUT: DISSOLVE IN: Newspaper - Kane's marriage to Emily with still of group on White House lawn, same setup as early newsreel in News Digest. ,24700
DISSOLVE: Screaming headline: OIL SCANDAL! DISSOLVE: Headline reading: KANE TO SEE PRESIDENT DISSOLVE: Big headline on "Enquirer" front page which reads: KANE TO SEE PRESIDENT Under this, one of those big box signed editorials, typical of Kane, illustrated, on subject of the power of the president, expressed in about nine different cases of type, and illustrated by a cartoon of the White House, on which camera tightens, as we - DISSOLVE OUT: DISSOLVE IN: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - THE PRESIDENT'S EXECUTIVE OFFICE - DAY - This scene is shot so as never to show the President - or at least never his face. ,7010
There is present the President's Secretary, sitting on one side of the desk, intently taking notes. ,72600
Kane is on his feet, in front of the desk, tense and glaring. ,1660000
THE PRESIDENT It is the unanimous opinion of my Cabinent - in which I concur - that the proposed leases are in the best interests of the Governement and the people. (pauses) You are not, I hope, suggesting that these interests are not indentical? ,18
KANE I'm not suggesting anything, Mr. President! I've come here to tell you that, unless some action is taken promptly - and you are the only one who can take it - the oil that is the property of the people of this country will be turned over for a song to a gang of high- pressure crooks! THE PRESIDENT (calmly) I must refuse to allow you to continue in this vein, Mr. Kane. ,654
KANE (screaming) It's the only vein I know. ,5490000
I tell the facts the way I see them. ,77100000
And any man that knows that facts - THE PRESIDENT I know the facts, Mr. Kane. ,201000
And I happen to have the incredible insolence to differ with you as to what they mean. (pause) You're a man of great talents, Mr. Kane. ,4550
THE PRESIDENT I understand that you have political ambitions. ,6690000
Unfortunately, you seem incapable of allowing any other opinion but your own - KANE (building to a frenzy) I'm much obliged, Mr. President, for your concern about me. ,13500
However, I happen to be concerned at this moment with the matter of extensive oil lands belonging to the people of the United States, and I say that if this lease goes through, the property of the people of the United States goes into the hands of - THE PRESIDENT (interrupting) You've made your point perfectly clear, Mr. Kane. ,51000
The Secretary rises. ,1190000
Kane, with every bit of will power remotely at his disposal to control what might become an hysterical outburst, manages to bow. ,16000
KANE Mr. President. ,11700000
He starts out of the office. ,271000
DISSOLVE: INT. COMPOSING ROOM - ENQUIRER - NIGHT - Kane, Reilly, Leland and a composing room Foreman, in working clothes, bending over a table with several forms of type. ,68
They are looking, at this moment, at a made-up headline - but Kane's back is in the way ... so we can't read it. ,785000
FOREMAN How about it, Mr. Kane? ,12800000
Reilly glances at his wrist watch and makes a face. ,815000
Kane smiles as he notices this. ,303000
Let her slide! He turns away, and we can now read the headline. ,4240000
Insert of the headline, which reads: "OIL THEFT BECOMES LAW AS PRESIDENT WITHOLDS VETO" DISSOLVE: Here follows a quick montage (presently to be worked out) of no more than four or five images in which the President, by means of cartoons, editorials, headlines (all faithfully reproduced from period yellow journalism) is violently attacked. ,87
The montage ends on the word TREASON. The music cuts. ,58300
A hand reaches in a side pocket which contains a newspaper - recognizably the "Enquirer." The hand removes a gun. ,1910
Many arms seize the hand which is pulled up - gun still firing. ,463000
As the arm is raised in the air, we see that the other arms holding the arm and struggling with it are uniformed, and we see the White House beyond. ,28000
DISSOLVE: News ticker which is spelling out the words: "ASSASSINATED 7:45 P.M." NOTE: Under the following - a down shot, below the "Enquirer," shows a crowd forming, looking angrily up toward the camera. ,54
Crowd noises on the soundtrack under music. ,148000
A hand snatches the ticker tape away and as the image of the crowd dissolves out, we pull back to show: INT. OF KANE'S OFFICE - NIGHT - The ticker tape is in Reilly's hand. ,983
Reilly has a phone to his ear. ,3550000
REILLY Looks bad for us, Mr. Kane. ,173000
How shall we handle it? ,2950000
DISSOLVE OUT: DISSOLVE IN: INT. GEORGIE'S PLACE - Kane in shirtsleeves at phone. ,1630
KANE It's a news story! Get it on the street! DISSOLVE: Headline under "Enquirer" masthead which reads: "PRESIDENT ASSASSINATED" Newsboy is crying the headline at the same time. ,75
We pull back to show him and - DISSOLVE: INT. THEATRE - NIGHT The camera is in tight on a box which contains Emily and distinguished elderly ladies and gentlemen, obviously family and friends. ,13100
On the soundtrack, very limpid opera music. ,2220000
Another elderly gent, in white tie but still wearing an overcoat, comes into the box and whispers to Emily. ,38100
He has a copy of the "Enquirer" in his hand. ,12600000
He shows the paper to her. ,8850000
DISSOLVE: EXT. STREET OUTSIDE ENQUIRER BUILDING - NIGHT - An angry crowd seen from the window of Kane's office. ,25100
They make a deep threatening sound which is audible during the following scene. ,220000
Across the heads of the crowd are two great squares of light from the windows above them. ,503000
One of these disappears as the blind is pulled. ,81000
As the dissolve completes itself, the second square of light commences to reduce in size, and then the entire street is cut off by a blind which Leland pulls down, covering the entire frame. ,16100
INT. KANE'S OFFICE - ENQUIRER - NIGHT - The staff standing around, worried to death, in their shirtsleeves. ,92200
KANE (to Reilly) Take dictation - Front page editorial - "This afternoon a great man was assassinated. ,24400000
He was the President of the United States -" LELAND Charlie - KANE Yes? ,182000
LELAND Do you think you're the one who should call him a great man? ,1130000
KANE Why not? ,14800000
LELAND Why not? ,10300000
Well - nobody's a great man in your estimation until he's dead. ,1810000
REILLY (quickly) Maybe we'd better wait for more word on the President's condition. ,43200
KANE (still looking at Leland) What do you mean by that? ,14300000
LELAND (quietly) Competition. ,941000
REILLY He may recover - KANE (still holding on Leland) What do you mean by that? ,142000
LELAND (steadily) Yesterday morning you called the President a traitor. ,12300
What do you think that crowd is doing down there? ,1320000
They think you murdered him. ,3250000
KANE Because the crackpot who did it had a copy of the "Enquirer" in his pocket? ,23300
LELAND - and that copy of the "Enquirer" said the President should be killed. ,22500
KANE I said treason was a capital offense punishable by death - LELAND You've said a lot of things about the President in the last few months. ,645
KANE They're true! Everything I said! Witholding that veto was treason! LELAND (interrupting) Charlie! KANE (riding over him) Oil belonging to the people of the United States was leased out for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks - Nobody can blame me because - LELAND Look out that window. ,61
Kane stops - looks at him. ,5590000
LELAND There are the people of the United States, and they are blaming you - Oh, I know it doesn't make any sense, but at least you can learn a lesson from it. ,1080000
KANE (snarling) What lesson? ,33300
Not to expose fraud when I see it? ,1320000
KANE (sharply) I don't have to. ,115000000
I run a newspaper with half a million readers and they're getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast. ,110000
Besides, they all know I'm married to his niece. ,12600000
I've got to think of her. ,179000
KANE I've got to think of Emily - LELAND (after a silence) I'd like to talk to you about that. ,65700
Leland looks back at Kane, is conscious of the boys standing around. ,257000
LELAND Finish your editorial. ,34400
Leland walks out in to the City Room. ,130000
More staff members in shirt sleeves in a state of panic. ,1540000
Leland goes to his desk, takes out a bottle, pours himself a very stiff drink. ,5330
A Policeman enters with Bernstein. ,149000
Bernstein is badly battered. ,236000
LELAND (worried) What's happened? ,73100000
BERNSTEIN (smiling) I'm all right, Mr. Leland. ,3610000
Only there was some fellows out front that thought they ought to take things up with me. ,811000
I learned 'em! Didn't I, officer? ,1140000
THE COP (grinning) You sure did - Say, the Commissioner said I was to stand by and protect Mr. Kane until further orders, no matter how he felt about it. ,36800
LELAND (finishing his drink) In there. ,128000
BERNSTEIN If you hadn't come along and protected me when you did, I'd have killed them fellows. ,106000
LELAND (pouring himself another drink) Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein. (he looks his face over thoroughly) There doesn't seem to be an serious injury. ,11000
BERNSTEIN Not to me. ,262000000
But you will let that cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't you? ,166000
LELAND Yes, Mr. Bernstein. ,125000
Bernstein leaves the picture with sympathetic attendance. ,21200
Leland finishes his second drink. ,3120000
DISSOLVE: INT. KANE'S OFFICE - NIGHT - The bottle is finished. ,382000
The door in the Sanctrum opens. ,16900
Reilly and the others leave. ,1880000
REILLY (as they go) Goodnight, Mr. Kane. ,70300
Kane stands in the door, waiting for Leland. ,86300
Leland gets up and moves toward the office - goes in, sits down across from Kane at the desk. ,69300
Then Kane smiles ingratiatingly. ,104000
Leland tries to cope with this. ,152000
LELAND First of all - (he can't go on) KANE (not cruelly - genuinely kind) What's wrong, Brad? ,202000
LELAND I'm drunk. ,2410000
KANE I'll get you some coffee. ,15200000
LELAND First of all, I will not write a good review of a play because somebody paid a thousand dollars for an advertisement in the "Enquirer." KANE (gently - opening the door) That's just a little promotion scheme. ,7130
Nobody expects you - (calling) Mike, will you try and get Mr. Leland some coffee? ,11100
MIKE'S VOICE Sure thing, Mr. Kane. ,577000
Kane turns back to Leland. ,973000
Leland doesn't look up at him. ,10400000
LELAND Charlie, it's just no go. ,52300
We can't agree anymore. ,57600000
I wish you'd let me go to Chicago. ,2260000
KANE Why, Brad? ,5570000
LELAND I want to be transferred to the new paper. ,23500
You've been saying yourself you wish you had somebody to - (he is heartsick, inarticulate) That's not what I wanted to talk about. ,4140
Kane goes around behind the desk and sits down. ,236000
KANE I'll tell you what I'll do, Brad - I'll get drunk, too - maybe that'll help. ,229000
LELAND No, that won't help. ,390000
I wanted to talk about you and Emily. ,38100000
Kane looks at Leland sharply before he speaks. ,12100
KANE (quietly) All right. ,721000
LELAND (without looking at him) She's going to leave you - KANE I don't think so, Brad. ,137000
We've just had word that the President is out of danger. (ruefully) It seems I didn't kill him after all. ,138000
LELAND (takes his eye) She was going to leave you anyway - Kane takes this in. ,3020000
LELAND Emily's going south next week with the child. ,1210000
As far as anybody's to know, it's a holiday. ,42200000
When they get back - KANE (sharply) Brad, you are drunk. ,39200000
LELAND Sure I am. ,17800000
She wants full custody of the child no matter what happens. ,1630000
If you won't agree to that, she'll apply for a divorce regardless of the President's wishes. ,6030
I can't tell her she's wrong, because she isn't wrong - KANE Why is she leaving me? ,1660000
LELAND (it's very hard for him to say all this) She hasn't any friends left sine you started this oil business, and she never sees you. ,40400
KANE Do you think the "Enquirer" shouldn't have campaigned against the oil leases? ,38800
LELAND (hesitating) You might have made the whole thing less personal! No answer from Kane. ,1680000
LELAND It isn't just that the President was her uncle - everyone she knows, all the people she's been brought up with, everything she's ever been taught to believe is important - Still no answer from Kane. ,25000
LELAND There's no reason why this - this savage personal note - KANE The personal note is all there is to it. ,186000
It's all there ever is to it. ,54900000
It's all there every is to anything! Stupidity in our government, complacency and self- satisfaction and unwillingness to believe that anything done by a certain class of people can be wrong - you can't fight those things impersonally. ,6250
They're not impersonal crimes against people. ,4260000
They're being done by actual persons - with actual names and positions and - the right of the American people to own their own country is not an academic issue, Brad, that you debate - and then the judges retire to return a verdict and the winners give a dinner for the losers. ,50500
LELAND You almost convince me. (rising) I'm just drunk enough to tell you the truth. ,3860000
I have to be a little drunk for that because I'm a coward. ,10200000
That's why you keep me around. (smiles) You only associate with your inferiors, Charlie. ,16200
I guess that's why you ran away from Emily. ,18900000
Because you can't stand the company of your equals. ,1900000
You don't like to admit they exist - the other big people in your world are dead. ,2840000
Kane looks at Leland, but Leland can't be stopped now. ,29400
He speaks very quietly - no poison in his voice - no personal indignation - as though he were explaining the nature of a disease. ,6510
LELAND You talk about the people of the United States as though they belonged to you. ,54900000
When you find out they don't think they are, you'll lose interest. ,2350000
You talk about giving them their rights as though you could make a present of liberty. ,1680000
You used to defend him quite a good deal. ,491000
Well, he's turning into something called organized labor and you don't like that at all. ,115000
And listen, when your precious underprivileged really get together - that's going to add up to something bigger than - than your privilege and then I don't know what you'll do - sail away to a desert island, probably, and lord it over the monkeys. ,7640
KANE Are you finished? ,17800000
LELAND Yes. (looking down) Now, will you let me go to Chicago? ,4110000
KANE (with a little smile) You're not going to like it in Chicago. ,5700000
They wind comes howling in from the lake. ,155000
And there's practically no opera season at all - and the Lord only knows whether they've ever heard of Lobster Newburg - LELAND That's all right. (he won't be charmed out of his duty) What are you going to do about Emily? ,636
KANE (his face hardning a little) Nothing - if she dosen't love me - Leland has risen. ,97
He speaks as he turns away, starting towards the door. ,682000
LELAND You want love on your own terms, don't you, Charlie - (he stops - his back turned to Kane) Love according to your own rules. ,480000
And if anything goes wrong and you're hurt - then the game stops, and you've got to be soothed and nursed, no matter what else is happening - and no matter who else is hurt! KANE It's simpler than that, Brad. ,4350
A society girl can't stand the gaff, that's all. ,46300
Other things are important to her - social position, what they're saying on the front porches at Southampton, is it going to be embarrassing to meet somebody or the other at dinner - Leland has turned, taking his eye again. ,4640
Now Kane stops and smiles. ,11900000
KANE She can leave me. ,434000
As a matter of fact, I've already left her. ,5860000
Don't worry, Brad - I'll live. ,3680000
LELAND I know you will. ,1540000
KANE (with all his charm) Hey, Brad! I've been analyzed an awful lot tonight - let's have another brandy. ,45700
Leland shakes his head. ,91300
Kane lifts his glass. ,575000
KANE To love on my terms. ,3150000
Those are the only terms anybody knows ... his own. ,137000
DISSOLVE: EXT. ENQUIRER BUILDING - NIGHT - Kane, Leland, and a couple of policemen make their way out of the front toward a hansom cab. ,6440
A VOICE FROM THE CROWD You moiderer! A rock is thrown. ,147000
It hits Leland on the face. ,307000
A little blood flows. ,8730000
Kane doesn't see it at first. ,4260000
Then when he's in the hansom cab, he turns and notices it. ,49700
KANE Are you hurt? ,7240000
Leland has a handkerchief to his face. ,12300
LELAND No. I wish you'd go home to Emily. ,52000000
She'll be pretty upset by all this - She still loves you - The crowd, pushed by the cops, retreats in the background, but still hard by. ,11600
KANE You still want to be transferred to the other paper? ,2600000
KANE (leaning out of the hansom cab) Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York. ,6030
It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth. (almost as a question) LELAND (with handkerchief still attached to his face) I couldn't possibly live on as little as that, Charlie. ,7980
We'll let the salary stay where it is. ,816000
The hansom cab starts up. ,21700
We hold on Leland's face as we DISSOLVE OUT: DISSOLVE IN: INT. KANE'S NEW YORK HOME - KANE'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING - Emily is in bed, a damp cloth over her temples. ,7460
Kane is standing at the foot of the bed. ,192000
The baby's bed is in a corner of the room. ,4280000
The baby's nurse is standing near the crib, a nurse for Emily is near her. ,216000
Kane is looking fixedly on Emily, who is staring tiredly at the ceiling. ,1890
KANE (to the nurse) Excuse us a moment, please. ,152000
The nurse looks at Emily. ,546000
KANE (peremptorily) I said, excuse us a moment. ,52300
The nurse, unwilling, leaves. ,8530000
KANE I've been talking to Leland. ,176000
Emily - You can't leave me now - not now - Silence. ,406000
KANE It isn't what it would do to my changes in politics, Emily - That isn't it - They were talking of running me for governor, but now, of course, we'll have to wait - It isn't that, Emily - It's just - the president is your uncle and they're saying I killed him. ,95800
KANE That story about the murderer having a copy of the "Enquirer" in his pocket - the "Chronicle" made that up out of whole cloth - Emily, please - He's going to be all right, you know, he's going to recover - (bitterly) If it will make you any happier, we had nine pages of advertising cancelled in the first mail this morning. ,605
Bernstein is afraid to open any more letters. ,685000
He sees that he's getting no place with Emily. ,1430000
KANE (exasperated) What do you expect me to do? ,630000
What in the world - EMILY (weakly) Charles. ,47800
He waits for her to continue. ,88200
EMILY Do you really think - (she can't continue) Those threatening letters, can they really - She sits up and looks at the crib. ,23100
She almost continues to look at the crib, with almost unseeing eyes. ,23700
KANE (uncomfortably) They won't do anything to Junior, darling. (contemptuously) Anonymous letter writers - I've got guards in front of the house, and I'm going to arrange - EMILY (turning her face toward him) Please don't talk any more, Charles. ,534
Kane is about to say something, but bites his lips instead. ,146000
Emily keeps staring at him. ,16000000
EMILY Have they heard from father yet? ,27200000
Has he seen - KANE I've tried to tell you, Emily. ,13200000
The President's going to be all right. ,80500000
He had a comfortable night. ,39900
There's no danger of any kind. ,1530000
Emily nods several times. ,74800
There is an uncomforable silence. ,16900
Suddenly there is a cry from the crib. ,502000
Emily leaps from the bed and rushes to him. ,48400
She bends over the crib. ,11
EMILY (murmuring) Here I am, darling... ,8760
KANE Emily - you musn't leave me now - you can't do that to me. ,208000
EMILY They won't hurt you, darling. ,32600000
Mother's with you! Mother's looking after you! Kane, unwanted, ignored, looks on. ,222000
Tightening his lips, he walks out. ,212000
DISSOLVE OUT: DISSOLVE IN: INT. KANE'S OFFICE - NIGHT By the desk light, Kane is seen working with his usual intensity, Reilly standing beside him at the desk. ,34400
KANE We'll withdraw support completely. ,1130000
REILLY Mr. Leland sent back that check. ,8540000
KANE What check? ,11900000
REILLY You made it out to him last week after he left for Chicago. ,1480000
KANE Oh, yes, the bonus. ,247000
REILLY It was for twenty-five thousand dollars. ,3550000
Kane is perplexed and worried, but we can see in a moment his mind will be on something else. ,44600
REILLY He sent it back torn up - all torn up into little bits, and he enclosed something else - I can't make it out. ,2500
Kane doesn't answer. ,7260000
He has brought out a piece of paper and is reading it. ,33400000
REILLY It says here, "A Declaration of Principles" - (he still reads) "I will provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly" - Kane has looked up sharply. ,30100
Reilly, sensing his look, stops reading and meets his eye. ,103000
Slowly, Kane reaches out his hand. ,2820000
Reilly hands him the piece of paper. ,2110000
Without reading it, Kane tears it up, throws it into the wastebasket at his side. ,1710000
DISSOLVE: INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT - The evening of the final great rally. ,247000
These shots remind us of and are identical with and supplementary to the "News Digest" scenes earlier. ,11800
The vast auditorium with a huge picture of Kane, cheering crowds, etc. ,13300
Emily and Junior are to be seen in the front of a box. ,231000
Emily is tired and wears a forced smile on her face. ,161000
Junior, now aged nine and a half, is eager, bright- eyed and excited. ,73100
Kane is just finishing his speech. ,291000
KANE It is no secret that I entered upon this campaign with no thought that I could be elected Governor of this state! It is now no secret that every straw vote, every independent pole, shows that I will be elected. ,48100
And I repeat to you - my first official act as Governor will be to appoint a special District Attorney to arrange for the indictment, prosecution and conviction of Boss Edward G. ,30000
Rogers! Terrific screaming and cheering from the audience. ,16600
DISSOLVE OUT: INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT - The Speaker's Platform. ,479000
Numerous officials and civic leaders are crowding around Kane. ,13200
Cameramen take flash photographs with old-fashioined flash powder. ,111000
FIRST CIVIC LEADER Great speech, Mr. Kane. ,159000
SECOND LEADER (pompous) One of the most notable public utterances ever made by a candidate in this state - KANE Thank you, gentlemen. ,12200
He looks up and notices that the box in which Emily and the boy were sitting is now empty. ,1850000
He starts toward the rear of the platform, through the press of people, Reilly approaches him. ,29700
REILLY A wonderful speech, Mr. Kane. ,48900
Kane pats him on the shoulder as he walks along. ,767000
REILLY I just got word from Buffalo, Mr. Kane. ,209000
They're going to throw you the organization vote - and take a chance maybe you'll give them a break - This is said almost inquiringly, as if he were hoping that Kane would give him some assurance that McDonald is not making a mistake. ,17300
There is no answer from Kane. ,5160000
REILLY On an independent ticket there's never been anything like it! If the election were held today, you'd be elected by a hundred thousand votes - and every day between now and November 7th is just going to add to your majority. ,661
He continues with Reilly slowly through the crowd - a band playing off. ,5140
Bernstein joins him. ,9800000
KANE It does seem too good to be true, doesn't it, Mr. Bernstein? ,67100
REILLY Rogers isn't even pretending. ,90200
He isn't just scared anymore. ,35100000
Frank Norris told me last night he hasn't known Rogers to be that worried in twenty-five years. ,448000
KANE I think it's beginning to dawn on Mr. Rogers that I mean what I say. ,184000
With Mr. Rogers out of the way, Reilly, I think we may really begin to hope for a good government in this state. (stopping) Well, Mr. Bernstein? ,23900
BERNSTEIN (clearly not meaning it) It's wonderful, Mr. Kane. ,170000
KANE You don't really think so? ,16300000
I mean, since you're running for Governor - and you want to be elected - I think it's wonderful you're going to be elected. ,45100
Only - (interrupts himself) - Can I say something? ,3740000
KANE Please, Mr. Bernstein. ,7460000
BERNSTEIN Well, the way I look at it - (comes out with it) - You want to know what I really think would be wonderful? ,2180000
Kane indicates he is to proceed. ,3860000
BERNSTEIN Well, you're running for Governor and going to be elected - my idea is how wonderful it would be if you don't run at all and don't get elected. ,32300
DISSOLVE: EXT. ONE OF THE EXITS - MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT - Emily and Junior are standing, waiting for Kane. ,2200
JUNIOR Is Pop Governor yet, Mom? ,191000
Just then, Kane appears, with Reilly and several other men. ,789000
Kane rushes toward Emily and Junior, as the men politely greet Emily. ,57200
KANE Hello, Butch! Did you like your old man's speech? ,11000000
JUNIOR Hello, Pop! I was in a box. ,5100000
KANE I saw you! (he has his arm around Junior's shoulder) Good night, gentlemen. ,528000
There are good nights. ,7300000
Kane's car is at the curb and he starts to walk toward it with Junior and Emily. ,2230
EMILY I'm sending Junior home in the car, Charles - with Oliver - KANE But I'd arranged to go home with you myself. ,33600
EMILY There's a call I want you to make with me, Charles. ,19500000
KANE It can wait. ,11500000
EMILY No, it can't. (she bends down and kisses Junior) Good night, darling. ,2750000
JUNIOR Good night, Mom. ,23400
The driver is holding the rear door open as Emily guides Junior in. ,204000
KANE (as car starts to drive off) What's this all about, Emily? ,8240000
I've had a very tiring day and - EMILY It may not be about anything at all. ,12000000
A cab has pulled up. ,10100000
THE DRIVER Cab? ,14400000
Emily nods to him. ,16000000
EMILY I intend to find out. ,4790000
KANE I insist on being told exactly what you have in mind. ,2670000
EMILY I'm going to - (she looks at a slip of paper in her hand) - 185 West 74th Street. ,52400
Kane's reaction indicates that the address definitely means something to him. ,33200
EMILY If you wish, you can come with me... ,113000000
Kane nods. ,3160
KANE I'll go with you. ,22700000
He opens the door and she enters the cab. ,325000
He follows her. ,75500
DISSOLVE: INT. CAB - NIGHT - Kane and Emily. ,1230000
He looks at her, in search of some kind of enlightenment. ,938000
Her face is set and impassive. ,24000000
DISSOLVE: EXT. AND INT. APARTMENT HOUSE HALLWAY - NIGHT - Kane and Emily, in front of an apartment door. ,59900
Emily is pressing the bell. ,1100000
KANE I had no idea you had this flair for melodrama, Emiliy. ,44000
Emily does not answer. ,36900000
The door is opened by a maid, who recognizes Kane. ,19400
THE MAID Come in, Mr. Kane, come in. ,2
They enter, Emily first. ,12300000
INT. SUSAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - There is first a tiny reception room, through which an open door shows the living room. ,122000
Kane and Emily enter from the hallway and cross to the living room. ,1690000
As they enter, Susan rises from a chair. ,120000
The other person in the room - a big, heavyset man, a little past middle age - stays where he is, leaning back in his chair, regarding Kane intently. ,6020
SUSAN It wasn't my fault, Charlie. ,2510000
He made me send your wife a note. ,498000
He said I'd - oh, he's been saying the most terrible things, I didn't know what to do... ,2620000
I - (she catches sight of Emily) ROGERS Good evening, Mr. Kane. (he rises) I don't suppose anybody would introduce us. ,92
Kane, I am Edward Rogers. ,225000
EMILY How do you do? (pauses) I came here - and I made Mr. Kane come with me... (she consults the note in her hand without reading it again) because I recieved this note - ROGERS I made Miss - Miss Alexander send you the note. ,6820
She was a little unwilling at first - (he smiles grimly) but she did it. ,48900
SUSAN I can't tell you the things he said, Charlie. ,937000
You haven't got any idea - KANE (turning on Rogers) Rogers, I don't think I will postpone doing something about you until I'm elected. (he starts toward him) To start with, I'll break your neck. ,2900
ROGERS (not giving way an inch) Maybe you can do it and maybe you can't, Mr. Kane. ,22500
EMILY Charles! (he stops to look at her) Your - your breaking this man's neck - (she is clearly disgusted) would scarcely explain this note - (glancing at the note) Serious consequences for Mr. Kane - (slowly) for myself, and for my son. ,1930
What does this note mean, Miss - SUSAN (stiffly) I'm Susan Alexander. (pauses) I know what you think, Mrs. ,3850
Kane, but - EMILY (ignoring this) What does this note mean, Miss Alexander? ,221000
ROGERS She doesn't know, Mrs. ,641000
She just sent it - because I made her see it wouldn't be smart for her not to send it. ,2330000
KANE In case you don't know, Emily, this - this gentleman - (he puts a world of scorn into the word) is - ROGERS I'm not a gentleman, Mrs. ,46100
Kane, and your husband is just trying to be funny calling me one. ,2780000
I don't even know what a gentleman is. (tensely, with all the hatred and venom in the world) You see, my idea of a gentleman, Mrs. ,8320
Kane - well, if I owned a newspaper and if I didn't like the way somebody else was doing things - some politican, say - I'd fight them with everything I had. ,38800
Only I wouldn't show him in a convict suit, with stripes - so his children could see the picture in the paper. ,1030000
Or his mother. (he has to control himself from hurling himself at Kane) It's pretty clear - I'm not a gentleman. ,13800
EMILY Oh!! KANE You're a cheap, crooked grafter - and your concern for your children and your mother - ROGERS Anything you say, Mr. Kane. ,75700
Only we're talking now about what you are. ,73400000
That's what the note is about, Mrs. ,71900000
Now I'm going to lay all my cards on the table. ,30100000
I'm fighting for my life. ,77700000
Not just my political life. ,268000
My life. ,16000000
If your husband is elected governor - KANE I'm going to be elected governor. ,1980000
And the first thing I'm going to do - EMILY Let him finish, Charles. ,2720000
ROGERS I'm protecting myself every way I know how, Mrs. ,2290000
This last week, I finally found out how I can stop your husband from being elected. ,1780000
If the people of this state learn what I found out this week, he wouldn't have a chance to - he couldn't be elected Dog Catcher. ,59700
Well, what I'm interested in is seeing that he's not elected. ,29800000
I don't care whether they know what I know about him. ,4550000
Let him keep right on being the Great, Noble, Moral - (he stresses the world) Champeen of the people. ,1760
Just as long as - EMILY I think I understand, Mr. Rogers, but wonder if - (she leaves her sentence unfinished) KANE You can't blackmail me, Rogers, you can't - SUSAN (excitedly) Charlie, he said, unless you withdrew your name - ROGERS That's the chance I'm willing to give you, Mr. Kane. ,549
More of a chance than you'd give me. ,860000
Unless you make up your mind by tomorrow that you're so sick that you've got to go away for a year or two - Monday morning every paper in this State will carry the story I'm going to give them. ,93900
Kane starts to stare at him intently. ,33800
EMILY What story, Mr. Rogers? ,8010000
ROGERS The story about him and Miss Alexander, Mrs. ,1470000
Emily looks at Kane. ,14800000
SUSAN There is no story. ,53100000
It's all lies. ,25400000
Mr. Kane is just - ROGERS (to Susan) Shut up! (to Kane) I've had a dozen men doing nothing but run this thing down - we've got evidence enough to - well, the evidence would stand up in any court of law. ,89100
You want me to give you the evidence, Mr. Kane? ,30400000
KANE You do anything you want to do. ,102000000
The people of this state can decide which one of us to trust. ,158000000
If you want to know, they've already decided. ,2890000
The election Tuesday'll be only - ROGERS Mrs. ,2890000
Kane, I'm not asking you to believe me. ,4440000
I'd like to show you - EMILY You don't have to show me anything, Mr. Rogers. ,93800000
I believe you. ,13000000
ROGERS I'd rather Mr. Kane withdrew without having to get the story published. ,773000
Not that I care about him. ,79000000
But I'd be better off that way - (he pauses) - and so would you, Mrs. ,2920000
SUSAN What about me? (to Kane) He said my name'd be dragged through the mud. ,359000
He said everywhere I'd go from now on - EMILY There seems to be only one decision you can make, Charles. ,102000
I'd say that it has been made for you. (pauses) I suppose the details can be arranged tomorrow, Mr. Rogers. ,294000
About the statements by the doctors - KANE Have you gone completely mad, Emily? ,15500
Emily looks at him. ,8480000
KANE You don't think I'm going to let this blackmailer intimidate me, do you? ,12400
EMILY I don't see what else you can do, Charles. ,2500000
If he's right - and the papers publish this story he has - KANE Oh, they'll publish it all right. ,4910000
But that's not going to stop me - EMILY Charles, this - this story - doesn't concern only you. ,570000
I'll be in it, too, won't I? (quickly) And Junior? ,35500000
KANE (squirming a bit) I suppose so, but - I'm not afraid of the story. ,19300
You can't tell me that the voters of this state - EMILY I'm not interested in the voters of this state right now. ,474000
I am interested in - well, Junior, for one thing. ,12500000
SUSAN Charlie! If they publish this story - EMILY They won't. ,3670000
Goodnight, Mr. Rogers. (she starts out) There's nothing more to be said, Charles. ,308000
KANE Oh yes, there is. ,2
EMILY I don't think so. ,50700
Are you coming, Charles? ,75700000
KANE No. She looks at him. ,1
He starts to work himself into a rage. ,46900000
KANE There's only one person in the world to decide what I'm going to do - and that's me. ,5230000
And if you think - if any of you think - EMILY You decided what you were going to do, Charles - some time ago. (she looks at Susan) You can't always have it your own way, regardless of anything else that may have happened. (she sighs) Come on, Charles. ,19800
KANE Go on! Get out! I can fight this thing all alone! ROGERS You're making a bigger fool of yourself than I thought you would, Mr. Kane. ,26300
You're licked. ,34900
Why don't you - KANE (turning on him) Get out! I've got nothing to talk to you about. ,515000
If you want to see me, have the Warden write me a letter. ,5850000
ROGERS I see! (he starts toward the door) SUSAN (starting to cry) Charlie, you're just excited. ,90
You don't realize - KANE I know exactly what I'm doing. (he is screaming) Get out! EMILY (quietly) Charles, if you don't listen to reason, it may be too late - KANE Too late for what? ,36900
Too late for you and this - (he can't find the adjective) this public thief to take the love of the people of this state away from me? ,210000
Well, you won't do it, I tell you. ,131000000
You won't do it! SUSAN Charlie, there are other things to think of. (a sly look comes into her eyes) Your son - you don't want him to read in the papers - EMILY It is too late now, Charles. ,98700
KANE (rushes to the door and opens it) Get out, both of you! SUSAN (rushes to him) Charlie, please don't - KANE What are you waiting here for? ,5320
Why don't you go? ,7940000
EMILY Goodnight, Charles. ,554000
She walks out. ,5070000
Rogers stops as he gets directly in front of Kane. ,38900
ROGERS You're the greatest fool I've ever known, Kane. ,291000
If it was anybody else, I'd say what's going to happen to you would be a lesson to you. ,5430000
Only you're going to need more than one lesson. ,9510000
And you're going to get more than one lesson. (he walks past Kane) KANE Don't you worry about me. ,2330000
I'm Charles Foster Kane. ,92400
I'm no cheap, crooked politician, trying to save himself from the consequences of his crimes - INT. APARTMENT HOUSE HALLWAY - NIGHT - Camera angling toward Kane from other end of the hall. ,19700
Rogers and Emily are already down the hall, moving toward foreground. ,49300
Kane in apartment doorway background. ,1470000
KANE (screams louder) I'm going to send you to Sing Sing, Rogers. ,11900000
Sing Sing! Kane is trembling with rage as he shakes his fist at Rogers's back. ,12600
Susan, quieter now, has snuggled into the hollow of his shoulder as they stand in the doorway. ,56
DISSOLVE: The "Chronicle" front page with photograph (as in the "News Digest") revealing Kane's relations with Susan. ,46000
DISSOLVE OUT: DISSOLVE IN: Front page of "Chronicle" - Headline which reads: ROGERS ELECTED DISSOLVE: Front page of "Enquirer" - Headline which reads: FRAUD AT POLLS DISSOLVE: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - Emily is opening the door for Leland. ,5610
EMILY Hello, Brad - LELAND Emily - He pauses. ,16800
Leland comes in. ,9860000
Emily closes the door. ,877000
EMILY I'm sorry I sent for you, Brad - didn't - LELAND Chicago is pretty close to New York nowadays - only twenty hours - She doesn't have anything to say. ,18300
LELAND I'm glad to see you. ,6480000
She smiles at him and we know that there isn't anybody else in the world for her to smile at. ,1580000
She's too grateful to talk. ,4910000
EMILY Are all the returns in? ,2960000
Leland puts his hat unconsciously on his coat by the newspaper. ,9910
EMILY Let me see it. ,4780000
Leland takes the newspaper out of his pocket and hands it to her. ,644000
We see the headline, not an insert, but it registers. ,8530
It reads: "Fraud at Polls." Emily is looking at the paper with unseeing eyes, and a little smile. ,95400
LELAND (after a pause) Almost two to one - EMILY I'm surprised he got the votes he did. ,51500
LELAND Emily! EMILY Why should anyone vote for him? ,160000
He's made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them. ,9640000
Children - to be told one thing one day, something else the next, as the whim seizes him. ,78400
And they're supposed to be grateful and love and adore him - because he sees to it that they get cheap ice and only pay a nickel in the street cars. ,37300
LELAND Emily, you're being - a little unfair - You know what I think of Charles' behavior - about your personal lives - EMILY There aren't any personal lives for people like us. ,6230
He made that very clear to me nine years ago - If I'd thought of my life with Charles as a personal life, I'd have left him then - LELAND know that, Emily - EMILY (on top of Leland) Maybe I should have - the first time he showed me what a mad dog he really was. ,17500
LELAND (on the cue "dog") Emily, you - EMILY Brad, I'm - I'm not an old woman yet - LELAND It's - all over - He stops himself. ,37800
EMILY (after a pause) Know it is, Brad - LELAND He's paying for it, Emily. ,1660
Those returns tonight - he's finished. ,2290000
Politically - (he thinks) - socially, everywhere, I guess. don't know about the papers, but - EMILY If you're asking me to sympathize with him, Brad, you're wasting your time. (pauses) There's only one person I'm sorry for, as a matter of fact. ,961
That - that shabby little girl. ,11600000
I'm really sorry for her, Brad. ,46800
DISSOLVE: Front page Chicago "Enquirer," with photograph proclaiming that Susan Alexander opens at new Chicago Opera House in "Thais," as in "News Digest." On soundtrack during above we hear the big, expectant murmur of an opening night audience and the noodling of the orchestra. ,33
DISSOLVE: INT. CHICAGO OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT - SET FOR "THAIS" - The camera is just inside the curtain, angling upstage. ,6320
We see the set for "Thais" - the principals in place - stage managers, stage hands, etc., and in the center of all this, in an elaborate costume, looking very small and very lost, is Susan. ,22300
She is almost hysterical with fright. ,1120000
Maids, singing teacher, and the rest are in attendance. ,145000
Applause is heard at the opening of the shot, and now the orchestra starts thunderously. ,26200
The curtain starts to rise - the camera with it - the blinding glare of the foots moves up Susan's body and hits her face. ,12700
She squints and starts to sing. ,13800
Camera continues on up with the curtain, up past Susan, up the full height of the proscenium arch and then on up into the gridiron into a world of ropes, brick walls and hanging canvas - Susan's voice still heard - but faintly. ,69
The camera stops at the top of the gridiron as the curtain stops. ,228000
Two typical stage hands fill the frame. ,75400
They are looking down on the stage below. ,297000
Some of the reflected light gleams on their faces. ,531000
One of them puts his hand to his nose. ,1180000
DISSOLVE OUT: DISSOLVE IN: INT. LELAND'S OFFICE - CHICAGO ENQUIRER - NIGHT - Leland, as in the same scene in the Bernstein sequence, is sprawled across his typewriter, his head on the keys. ,1490
The paper is gone from the roller. ,661000
Leland stirs and looks up drunkenly, his eyes encountering Bernstein, who stands beside him (also as in the previous scene). ,245
BERNSTEIN Hello, Mr. Leland. ,220000
LELAND Hello, Bernstein. ,536000
Leland makes a terrific effort to pull himself together. ,51200
He straightens and reaches for the keys - then sees the paper is gone from the machine. ,443000
LELAND Where is it - where's my notice? ,24400000
I've got to finish it! BERNSTEIN (quietly) Mr. Kane is finishing it. ,8880
LELAND Kane? ,5400
Charlie? (painfully, he rises to his feet) Where is he? ,108000
During all this, the sound of a typewriter has been heard off - a busy typewriter. ,290000
Leland's eyes follow the sound. ,365000
Slowly he registers Kane in the City Room beyond. ,89900
This is almost the same shot as in the previous Bernstein story. ,3640000
INT. CITY ROOM - CHICAGO ENQUIRER - NIGHT - Kane, in white tie and shirt sleeves, is typing away at a machine, his fingers working briskly and efficiently, his face, seen by the desk light before him, set in a strange half-smile. ,2000
Leland stands in the door of his office, staring across at him. ,470000
LELAND I suppose he's fixing it up - I know I'd never get that through. ,1080000
BERNSTEIN (moving to his side) Mr. Kane is finishing your piece the way you started it. ,208000
Leland turns incredulously to Bernstein. ,201000
BERNSTEIN He's writing a roast like you wanted it to be - (then suddnely - with a kind of quiet passion rather than a triumph) - I guess that'll show you. ,33200
Leland picks his way across the City Room to Kane's side. ,28000
Kane goes on typing, without looking up. ,3250000
After a pause, Kane speaks. ,4670000
KANE Hello, Brad. ,1180000
LELAND Hello, Charlie - (ANOTHER PAUSE) I didn't know we were speaking. ,23700
Kane stops typing, but doesn't turn. ,14400000
KANE Sure, we're speaking, Brad - you're fired. ,104000
He starts typing again, the expression on his face doesn't change. ,8120000
DISSOLVE OUT: DISSOLVE IN: EXT. HOSPITAL ROOF - DAY - Thompson and Leland on the roof, which is now deserted. ,12100
It is getting late. ,16400000
The sun has just about gone down. ,45900000
LELAND Well, that's about all there is - and I'm getting chills. ,1710000
Hey, nurse! (pause) Five years ago, he wrote from that place of his down South - (as if trying to think) - you know. ,16000
Shangri-la? ,9920000
El Dorado? (pauses) Sloppy Joe's? ,1340
What's the name of that place? ,100000000
I knew what it was all the time. ,42800
You caught on, didn't you? ,17500000
THOMPSON Yes. ,18800
LELAND I guess maybe I'm not as hard to see through as I think. ,13000000
Anyway, I never even answered his letter. ,508000
Maybe I should have. ,21500000
I guess he was pretty lonely down there those last years. ,779000
He hadn't finished it when she left him - he never finished it - he never finished anything. ,2160000
Of course, he built it for her - THOMPSON That must have been love. ,6180000
LELAND I don't know. ,9240000
He was disappointed in the world. ,2000000
So he built one of his own - An absolute monarchy - It was something bigger than an opera house anyway - (calls) Nurse! (lowers his voice) Say, I'll tell you one thing you can do for me, young fellow. ,32600
THOMPSON Sure. ,26700
LELAND On your way out, stop at a cigar store, will you, and send me up a couple of cigars? ,23700
THOMPSON Sure, Mr. Leland. ,1570000
I'll be glad to. ,613000
LELAND Hey, Nurse! A Nurse appears. ,196000
NURSE Hello, Mr. Leland. ,3310000
LELAND I'm ready to go in now. ,408000
You know when I was a young man, there was an impression around that nurses were pretty. ,1750000
It was no truer then than it is now. ,3930000
NURSE Here, let me take your arm, Mr. Leland. ,36900000
LELAND (testily) All right, all right. (he has begun to move forward on the Nurse's arm; turning to Thompson) You won't forget, will you, about the cigars? ,12500
And tell them to wrap them up to look like toothpaste, or something, or they'll stop them at the desk. ,2390000
That young doctor I was telling you about, he's got an idea he wants to keep me alive. ,1880000
DISSOLVE: EXT. "EL RANCHO" CABARET IN ATLANTIC CITY - EARLY DAWN - NEON SIGN ON THE ROOF: "EL RANCHO" FLOOR SHOW SUSAN ALEXANDER KANE TWICE NIGHTLY glows on the dark screen as in the previous sequence earlier in the script. ,37
Behind the lights and through them, we see a nasty early morning. ,5360000
Camera as before, moves through the lights of the sign and down on the skylight, through which is seen Susan at her regular table, Thompson seated across from her. ,49000
Very faintly during this, idle piano music playing. ,208000
DISSOLVE: INT. "EL RANCHO" CABARET - EARLY DAWN - Susan and Thompson are facing each other. ,5270
The place is almost deserted. ,1620000
Susan is sober. ,12100000
On the other side of the room, somebody is playing a piano. ,39100000
SUSAN How do you want to handle the whole thing - ask questions? ,11600000
THOMPSON I'd rather you just talked. ,2540000
Anything that comes into your mind - about yourself and Mr. Kane. ,455000
SUSAN You wouldn't want to hear a lot of what comes into my mind about myself and Mr. Charlie Kane. ,78500
Susan is thinking. ,12000000
THOMPSON How did you meet him? ,39600
SUSAN I had a toothache. ,96600
Thompson looks at her. ,3270000
SUSAN That was thiry years ago - and I still remember that toothache. ,129000
Boy! That toothache was just driving me crazy... ,2320000
DISSOLVE OUT: DISSOLVE IN: EXT. CORNER DRUG STORE AND STREET ON THE WEST SIDE OF NEW YORK - NIGHT - Susan, aged twenty, neatly but cheaply dressed in the style of the period, is leaving the drug store. ,29
It's about 8 o'clock at night. ,23100000
With a large, man-sized handkerchief pressed to her cheek, she is in considerable pain. ,15500
The street is wet - after a recent rain. ,338000
She walks a few steps towards the middle of the block, and can stand it no longer. ,54400
She stops, opens a bottle of Oil of Cloves that she has in her hand, applies some to her finger, and rubs her gums. ,47
She walks on, the pain only a bit better. ,163000
Four or five houses farther along, she comes to what is clearly her own doorway - a shabby, old four-story apartment house. ,10200
She turns toward the doorway, which is up a tiny stoop, about three steps. ,78000
As she does so, Kane, coming from the opposite direction, almost bumps into her and turns to his left to avoid her. ,16100
His shoulder bumps hers and she turns. ,41400
As she does so, Kane, forced to change his course, steps on the loose end of a plank which covers a puddle in the bad sidewalk. ,2280
The plank rises up and cracks him on the knee, also covering him with mud. ,13200
KANE (hopping up and down and rubbing his knee) Ow! Susan, taking her handkerchief from her jaw, roars with laughter. ,3200
KANE It's not funny. ,8020000
He bites his lip and rubs his knee again. ,336000
Susan tries to control her laughter, but not very successfully. ,23700
Kane glares at her. ,15600
SUSAN I'm sorry, mister - but you do look awful funny. ,1320000
Suddenly, the pain returns and she claps her hand to her jaw. ,260000
SUSAN Ow! KANE What's the matter with you? ,27900000
SUSAN Toothache. ,39
KANE Hmm! He has been rubbing his clothes with his handkerchief. ,72100
SUSAN You've got some on your face. ,1850000
KANE If these sidewalks were kept in condition - instead of the money going to some cheap grafter - Susan starts to laugh again. ,43200
KANE What's funny now? ,1770000
SUSAN You are. ,31600000
You look like you've been making mud pies. ,3450000
In the middle of her smile, the pain returns. ,877000
SUSAN Oh! KANE You're no Venus de Milo. ,441000
SUSAN (points to the downstair window) If you want to come in and wash your face - I can get you some hot water to get that dirt off your trousers - KANE Thanks. ,24400
Susan starts, with Kane following her. ,3000000
DISSOLVE: INT. SUSAN'S ROOM - NIGHT - It's in moderate disorder. ,847000
The Mansbach gas lights are on. ,10200
It's not really a classy room, but it's exactly what you're entitled to in 1910, for $5.00 a week including breakfast. ,10000
There is a bed, a couple of chairs, a chiffonier, and a few personal belongings on the chiffonier. ,39200
These include a photograph of a gent and lady, obviously Susan's parents, and a few objets d'art. ,13700
One, "At the Japanese Rolling Ball Game at Coney Island," and - perhaps this is part of the Japanese loot - the glass globe with the snow scene Kane was holding in his hand in the first sequence. ,11400
Susan comes into the room, carrying a basin, with towels over her arm. ,25100
Kane is waiting for her. ,1030000
She doesn't close the door. ,166000
SUSAN (by way of explanation) My landlady prefers me to keep this door open when I have a gentleman caller. (starts to put the basin down) She's a very decent woman. (making a face) Ow! Kane rushes to take the basin from her, putting it on the chiffonier. ,496
To do this, he has to shove the photograph to one side of the basin. ,221000
Susan grabs the photograph as it is about to fall over. ,2810000
SUSAN Hey, you should be more careful. ,1150000
That's my ma and pa. ,51200
KANE I'm sorry. ,2690000
They live here, too? ,38300
SUSAN No. They've passed on. ,1130000
Again she puts her hand to her jaw. ,3150000
KANE Where's the soap? ,7510000
SUSAN In the water. ,7380000
Kane fishes the soap out of the water. ,2070000
It is slippery, however, and slips out of his hand, hitting him in the chest before it falls to the floor. ,296000
Susan laughs as he bends over. ,161000
KANE (starting to wash his hands) You're very easily amused. ,289000
SUSAN I always like to see the funny side of things. ,7430000
No sense crying when you don't have to. ,233000
And you're so funny. ,11000000
Looking at you, I forget all about my toothache. ,28800000
Her face distorts in pain again. ,7300000
SUSAN Oh! KANE I can't stay here all night chasing your pain away. ,4630000
SUSAN (laughs) I know... ,178000
Kane, with soaped hands, has rubbed his face and now cannot open his eyes, for fear of getting soap in them. ,19800
KANE Where's the towel? ,255000
SUSAN On the chiffonier. ,10000000
KANE (rubs his face dry) Thanks. ,171000
SUSAN (on her way to closet) I've got a brush in the closet. ,207000
As soon as the mud on your trousers is all dry - you just brush it off. ,884000
KANE I'll get these streets fixed, if it's the last thing I do. ,52000
Susan comes out of the closet. ,35800
She holds out the brush with her left hand, her right hand to her jaw in real distress. ,90000
KANE (takes the brush) You are in pain, aren't you, you poor kid? ,98500
Susan can't stand it anymore and sits down in a chair, bent over, whimpering a bit. ,11900
KANE (brushing himself) Wish there was something I could - He stops and thinks. ,24700
Susan, her face averted, is still trying hard not to cry. ,110000
KANE I've got an idea, young lady. (there is no response) Turn around and look at me. (there is still no response) I said, turn around and look at me, young lady. ,1310000
Slowly, Susan turns. ,2240000
KANE Did you ever see anybody wiggle both his ears at the same time? ,33200
It takes a second for Susan to adapt herself to this. ,715000
KANE Watch closely! (he wiggles his ears) It took me two solid years at the finest boys' school in the world to learn that trick. ,1130
The fellow who taught me is President of Venezuela now. ,336000
He's still wiggling his ears as Susan starts to smile. ,30300
KANE That's it! Smile! Susan smiles, very broadly. ,518000
DISSOLVE: INT. SUSAN'S ROOM - NIGHT - Closeup of a duck, camera pulls back showing it to be a shadowgraph on the wall, made by Kane, who is now in his shirt sleeves. ,4040
It is about an hour later than preceding sequence. ,915000
SUSAN (hesitatingly) A chicken? ,9070
KANE No. But you're close. ,9640000
SUSAN A rooster? ,314000
KANE You're getting farther away all the time. ,1270000
It's a duck. ,56700000
SUSAN Excuse me, Mr. Kane. ,863000
I know this takes a lot of nerve, but - who are you? ,27700
I mean - I'm pretty ignorant, guess you caught on to that - KANE (looks squarely at her) You really don't know who I am? ,231000
SUSAN No. That is, I bet it turns out I've heard your name a million times, only you know how it is - KANE But you like me, don't you? ,38800
Even though you don't know who I am? ,27900000
SUSAN You've been wonderful! I can't tell you how glad I am you're here, I don't know many people and - (she stops) KANE And I know too many people. ,200000
Obviously, we're both lonely. (he smiles) Would you like to know where I was going tonight - when you ran into me and ruined my Sunday clothes? ,6340
SUSAN I didn't run into you and I bet they're not your Sunday clothes. ,3080000
You've probably got a lot of clothes. ,12900000
KANE (as if defending himself from a terrible onslaught) I was only joking! (pauses) This evening I was on my way to the Western Manhattan Warehouses - in search of my youth. ,954
Susan is bewildered. ,90500
KANE You see, my mother died, too - a long time ago. ,1060000
Her things were put into storage out west because I had no place to put them then. ,140000
I still haven't. ,3550000
But now I've sent for them just the same. ,8830000
And tonight I'd planned to make a sort of sentimental journey - (slowly) - to the scenes of my youth - my childhood, I suppose - to look again at - (he changes mood slightly) and now - Kane doesn't finish. ,28
He looks at Susan. ,667
KANE Who am I? ,17600000
Well, let's see. ,17900000
Charles Foster Kane was born in New Salem, Colorado in eighteen six - (he stops on the word "sixty" - obviously a little embarrassed) I run a couple of newspapers. ,5620
How about you? ,2400000
SUSAN Oh, me - KANE How old did you say you were? ,5820000
SUSAN (very bright) I didn't say. ,3800000
KANE I didn't think you did. ,74900000
If you had, I wouldn't have asked you again, because I'd have remembered. ,34400
How old? ,15400000
SUSAN Pretty old. ,3650000
I'll be twenty-two in August. ,1550000
KANE (looks at her silently for a moment) That's a ripe old age - What do you do? ,8980
SUSAN I work at Seligman's. ,100000
KANE Is that what you want to do? ,4130000
SUSAN I want to be a singer. (she thinks for a moment) I mean, I didn't. ,224000
Mother did for me. ,144000000
KANE (sympathetically) What happened to the singing? ,72500
You're not in a show, are you? ,303000
SUSAN Oh, no! Nothing like that. ,293000
Mother always thought - she used to talk about Grand Opera for me. ,1730000
Imagine! An American girl, for one thing - and then my voice isn't really that kind anyway, it's just that Mother - you know what mothers are like. ,37500
A sudden look comes over Kane's face. ,3
KANE Yes - SUSAN As a matter of fact, I do sing a little. ,2310000
KANE (points to the piano) Would you sing for me? ,31300000
SUSAN (bashful) Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me sing. ,2480000
KANE Yes, I would. ,14800000
That's why I asked. ,10100000
SUSAN Well, I - KANE Don't tell me your toothache is bothering you again? ,12900000
SUSAN Oh, no, that's all gone. ,50100000
KANE Then you have no alibi at all. ,35700000
Please sing. ,9070000
Susan, with a tiny ladylike hesitancy, goes to the piano and sings a polite song. ,6440
Sweetly, nicely, she sings with a small, untrained voice. ,16600
Kane listens. ,1140
He is relaxed, at ease with the world. ,1440000
DISSOLVE: INT. "EL RANCHO" CABARET - EARLY DAWN - Susan tosses down a drink, then goes on with her story. ,1630
SUSAN I did a lot of singing after that. ,4740000
I sang for Charlie - I sang for teachers at a hundred bucks an hour - the teachers got that, I didn't - THOMPSON What did you get? ,90500
SUSAN (glares at him balefully) What do you mean? ,9480000
Thompson doesn't answer. ,3030000
SUSAN I didn't get a thing. ,4760000
Just the music lessons. ,16400000
That's all there was to it. ,493000000
THOMPSON He married you, didn't he? ,3320000
SUSAN He was in love with me. ,15400000
But he never told me so until after it all came out in the papers about us - and he lost the election and that Norton woman divorced him. ,125000
THOMPSON What about that apartment? ,5740000
SUSAN He wanted me to be comfortable - Oh, why should I bother? ,1620000
You don't believe me, but it's true. ,3
It just happens to be true. ,19400000
He was really interested in my voice. (sharply) What are you smiling for? ,2490000
What do you think he built that opera house for? ,1990000
I didn't want it. ,26200000
I didn't want to sing. ,28100000
It was his idea - everything was his idea - except my leaving him. ,1700000
DISSOLVE: INT. LIVING ROOM OF KANE'S HOUSE IN NEW YORK - DAY - Susan is singing. ,269000
Matisti, her voice teacher, is playing the piano. ,895000
Kane is seated nearby. ,198000
Matisti stops. ,11
MATISTI Impossible! Impossible! KANE Your job isn't to give Mrs. ,13600
Kane your opinion of her talents. ,3090000
You're supposed to train her voice. ,46100000
Nothing more. ,7810000
MATISTI (sweating) But, it is impossible. ,391000
I will be the laughingstock of the musical world! People will say - KANE If you're interested in what people say, Signor Matisti, I may be able to enlighten you a bit. ,908
The newspapers, for instance. ,12400000
I'm an authority on what the papers will say, Signor Matisti, because I own eight of them between here and San Francisco... ,75900
It's all right, dear. ,101000000
Signor Matisti is going to listen to reason. ,38
Aren't you, maestro? (he looks him square in the eyes) MATISTI Mr. Kane, how can I persuade you - KANE You can't. ,1950000
There is a silence. ,9580000
Matisti rises. ,28
KANE I knew you'd see it my way. ,210000
DISSOLVE: INT. CHICAGO OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT - It is the same opening night - it is the same moment as before - except taht the camera is now upstage angling toward the audience. ,3010
The curtain is down. ,3570000
We see the same tableau as before - the terrified and trembling Susan, the apprehensive principals, the maids and singing teachers, the stage hands. ,3210
As the dissolve commences, there is the sound of applause (exactly as before) and now as the dissolve completes itself, the orchestra breaks frighteningly into opening chords of the music - the stage is cleared - Susan is left alone, terribly alone. ,1030
The curtain rises. ,11800000
The glare of the footlights jump into the image. ,124000
The curtain is now out of the picture and Susan starts to sing. ,144000
Beyond her, we see the prompter's box, containing the anxious face of the prompter. ,3270
Beyond that, out in the darkness - an apprehensive conductor struggles with his task of coordinating an orchestra and an incompetent singer. ,28500
Beyond that - dimly white shirt fronts and glistening bosoms for a couple of rows, and then deep and terrible darkness. ,12200
Closeup of Kane's face - seated in the audience - listening. ,92400
Sudden but perfectly correct lull in the music reveals a voice from the audience - a few words from a sentence - the kind of thing that often happens in a theatre - THE VOICE - really pathetic. ,6380
Music crashes in and drowns out the rest of the sentence, but hundreds of people around the voice have heard it (as well as Kane) and there are titters which grow in volume. ,3790
Closeup of Susan's face - singing. ,782000
Closeup of Kane's face - listening. ,47600
There is the ghastly sound of three thousand people applauding as little as possible. ,2750000
Kane still looks. ,1820000
Then, near the camera, there is the sound of about a dozen people applauding very, very loudly. ,9340
Camera moves back, revealing Bernstein and Reilly and other Kane stooges, seated around him, beating their palms together. ,4030
The curtain is falling - as we can see by the light which shutters down off their faces. ,124000
The stage from Kane's angle. ,15700000
The curtain is down - the lights glowing on it. ,250000
Still, the polite applause dying fast. ,126000
Nobody comes out for a bow. ,92700
Closeup of Kane - breathing heavily. ,5840
Suddenly he starts to applaud furiously. ,40700
The stage from the audience again. ,5780000
Susan appears for her bow. ,1570000
She can hardly walk. ,1830000
There is a little polite crescendo of applause, but it is sickly. ,12100
Closeup of Kane - still applauding very, very hard, his eyes on Susan. ,265000
The stage again. ,13900000
Susan, finishing her bow, goes out through the curtains. ,547000
The light on the curtain goes out and the houselights go on. ,74800
Closeup of Kane - still applauding very, very hard. ,12200
DISSOLVE: INT. STUDY - KANE'S NEW YORK HOME - DAY - Some weeks later. ,88900
Susan, in a negligee, is at the window. ,75300
There are the remains of her breakfast tray on a little table. ,3460000
SUSAN You don't propose to have yourself made ridiculous? ,152000
What about me? ,2620000
I'm the one that has to do the singing. ,67200000
I'm the one that gets the razzberries. (pauses) Last week, when I was shopping, one of the salesgirls did an imitation of me for another girl. ,4520
She thought I didn't see her, but - Charlie, you might as well make up your mind to it. ,2460000
This is one thing you're not going to have your own way about. ,6810000
I can't sing and you know it - Why can't you just - Kane rises and walks toward her. ,30900
There is cold menace in his walk. ,40500000
Susan shrinks a little as he draws closer to her. ,460000
KANE My reasons satisfy me, Susan. ,3330000
You seem unable to understand them. ,87700
I will not tell them to you again. (he is very close to her) You will continue with your singing. ,4230000
His eyes are relentlessly upon her. ,33500000
She sees something in them that frightens her. ,862000
She nods her head slowly, indicating surrender. ,70900
DISSOLVE OUT: DISSOLVE IN: Front page of the "San Francisco Enquirer" containing a large portrait of Susan as Thais (as before). ,3800
It is announced that Susan will open an independent season in San Francisco in "Thais." The picture remains constant but the names of the papers change from New York to St. Louis, to Los Angeles to Cleveland, to Denver to Philadelphia - all "Enquirers." During all this, on the soundtrack, Susan's voice is heard singing her aria very faintly and far away, her voice cracking a little. ,614
At the conclusion of this above, Susan has finished her song, and there is the same mild applause as before - over the sound of this, one man loudly applauding. ,1550
This fades out as we - DISSOLVE: INT. SUSAN'S BEDROOM - KANE'S NEW YORK HOME - LATE NIGHT - The camera angles across the bed and Susan's form towards the door, from the other side of which voices can be heard. ,23800
KANE'S VOICE Let's have your keys, Raymond. ,73400
RAYMOND'S VOICE Yes, sir. ,247000
KANE'S VOICE The key must be in the other side. (pause) We'll knock the door down, Raymond. ,4320
RAYMOND'S VOICE (calling) Mrs. ,262000
Kane - KANE'S VOICE Do what I say. ,1960000
The door crashes open, light floods in the room, revealing Susan, fully dressed, stretched out on the bed, one arm dangling over the side. ,8640
Kane rushes to her. ,83300
KANE Get Dr. Corey. ,603000
RAYMOND Yes, sir. ,32600
He rushes out. ,13300
Susan is breathing, but heavily. ,870000
Kane loosens the lace collar at her throat. ,109000
DISSOLVE: INT. SUSAN'S ROOM - LATE NIGHT - A little later. ,1080000
All the lights are lit. ,41800000
Susan, in a nightgown, is in bed, asleep. ,104000
Raymond and a nurse are just leaving the room, Raymond closing the door quietly behind him. ,44200
Dr. Corey rises. ,221000
DR. COREY She'll be perfectly all right in a day or two, Mr. Kane. ,21800
Kane nods. ,1990
He has a small bottle in his hand. ,979000
DR. COREY The nurse has complete instructions, but if you care to talk to me at any time, I should be only too glad - I shall be here in the morning. ,40700
I can't imagine how Mrs. ,271000
Kane came to make such a silly mistake. ,85000
The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle - I suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her. ,737
DR. COREY I'm sure that's it. (he starts out) KANE There are no objections to my staying here with her, are there? ,27400
DR. COREY Not at all. ,214000
I'd like the nurse to be here, too. ,762000
KANE Of course. ,11000000
Dr. Corey leaves. ,979000
Kane settles himself in a chair next to the bed, looking at Susan. ,55000
In a moment, the nurse enters, goes to a chair in the corner of the room, and sits down. ,31300
DISSOLVE: INT. SUSAN'S ROOM - DAY - Susan, utterly spent, is lying flat on her back in her bed. ,232000
Kane is in the chair beside her. ,43000
The nurse is out of the room. ,643000
SUSAN (in a voice that comes from far away) I couldn't make you see how I felt, Charlie. ,2140000
I just couldn't - I couldn't go threw with singing again. ,1970000
You don't know what it means to feel - to know that people - that an audience don't want you. ,5000000
That if you haven't got what they want - a real voice - they just don't care about you. ,3260000
Even when they're polite - and they don't laugh or get restless or - you know... ,138000
They don't want you. ,1720000
They just - KANE (angrily) That's when you've got to fight them. ,2620000
That's when you've got to make them. ,111000000
That's - Susan's head turns and she looks at him silently with pathetic eyes. ,418000
KANE I'm sorry. (he leans over to pat her hand) You won't have to fight them anymore. (he smiles a little) It's their loss. ,914000
Gratefully, Susan, with difficulty, brings her other hand over to cover his. ,14000000
DISSOLVE: EXT. ESTABLISHING SHOT OF XANADU - HALF BUILT INT. THE GRAND HALL IN XANADU - Closeup of an enormous jigsaw puzzle. ,266
A hand is putting in the last piece. ,3360000
Camera moves back to reveal jigsaw puzzle spread out on the floor. ,223000
Susan is on the floor before her jigsaw puzzle. ,365000
Kane is in an easy chair. ,366000
Behind them towers the massive Renaissance fireplace. ,726000
It is night and Baroque candelabra illuminates the scene. ,28600
SUSAN (with a sigh) What time is it? ,635000
There is no answer. ,861000
SUSAN Charlie! I said, what time is it? ,4780000
KANE (looks up - consults his watch) Half past eleven. ,50600
SUSAN I mean in New York. ,2910000
KANE Half past eleven. ,14800000
SUSAN At night? ,11900000
KANE Yes. ,10100
The bulldog's just gone to press. ,23600000
SUSAN (sarcastically) Hurray for the bulldog! (sighs) Half past eleven! The shows have just let out. ,4
People are going to night clubs and restaurants. ,80600
Of course, we're different. ,36600000
We live in a palace - at the end of the world. ,5650000
KANE You always said you wanted to live in a palace. ,89800
SUSAN Can't we go back, Charlie? ,46400000
Kane looks at her smilingly and turns back to his work. ,199000
SUSAN Charlie - There is no answer. ,2330000
SUSAN If I promise to be a good girl! Not to drink - and to entertain all the governors and the senators with dignity - (she puts a slur into the word) Charlie - There is still no answer. ,1890
DISSOLVE OUT: DISSOLVE IN: Another picture puzzle - Susan's hands fitting in a missing piece. ,84600
DISSOLVE: Another picture puzzle - Susan's hands fitting in a missing piece. ,84800
DISSOLVE: INT. XANADU - LIVING ROOM - DAY - Another picture puzzle. ,19100
Camera pulls back to show Kane and Susan in much the same positions as before, except that they are older. ,15100
KANE One thing I've never been able to understand, Susan. ,1010000
How do you know you haven't done them before? ,3900000
Susan shoots him an angry glance. ,120000
She isn't amused. ,2800000
SUSAN It makes a whole lot more sense than collecting Venuses. ,4260000
KANE You may be right - I sometimes wonder - but you get into the habit - SUSAN (snapping) It's not a habit. ,1130
I do it because I like it. ,41500000
KANE I was referring to myself. (pauses) I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow - it might be a nice change after the Wild West party tonight. ,19100
Invite everybody to go to the Everglades - SUSAN (throws down a piece of the jigsaw puzzle and rises) Invite everybody! Order everybody, you mean, and make them sleep in tents! Who wants to sleep in tents when they have a nice room of their own - with their own bath, where they know where everything is? ,11300
Kane has looked at her steadily, not hostilely. ,24900
KANE I thought we might invite everybody to go on a picnic tomorrow. ,46300
Stay at Everglades overnight. (he pats her lightly on the shoulder) Please see that the arrangements are made, Susan. ,31400
Kane turns away - to Bernstein. ,973000
KANE You remember my son, Mr. Bernstein. ,2770000
On the soundtrack we hear the following lines of dialogue: BERNSTEIN'S VOICE (embarrased) Oh, yes. ,38500
How do you do, Mr. Kane? ,717000000
CHARLIE JR.'S VOICE Hello. ,1870000
During this, camera holds on closeup of Susan's face. ,46800
She is very angry. ,13300000
DISSOLVE: EXT. THE EVERGLADES CAMP - NIGHT - Long shot - of a number of classy tents. ,3120
DISSOLVE OUT: DISSOLVE IN: INT. LARGE TENT - EVERGLADES CAMP - NIGHT - Two real beds have been set up on each side of the tent. ,39100
A rather classy dressing table is in the rear, at which Susan is preparing for bed. ,54200
Kane, in his shirt-sleeves, is in an easy chair, reading. ,300000
Susan is very sullen. ,439000
SUSAN I'm not going to put up with it. ,18100000
Kane turns to look at her. ,206000
SUSAN I mean it. (she catches a slight flicker on Kane's face) Oh, I know I always say I mean it, and then I don't - or you get me so don't do what I say I'm going to - but - KANE (interrupting) You're in a tent, darling. ,106000
You're not at home. ,850000
And I can hear you very well if you just talk in a normal tone of voice. ,1900000
SUSAN I'm not going to have my guests insulted, just because you think - (in a rage) - if people want to bring a drink or two along on a picnic, that's their business. ,31000
You've got no right - KANE (quickly) I've got more than a right as far as you're concerned, Susan. ,2970000
SUSAN Oh, I'm sick and tired of you telling me what I must and what I musn't do! KANE (gently) You're my wife, Susan, and - SUSAN I'm not just your wife, I'm a person all by myself - or I ought to be. ,12900
I was once. ,1850000
Sometimes you get me to believing I never was. ,375000
KANE We can discuss all this some other time, Susan. ,71700000
Right now - SUSAN I'll discuss what's on my mind when I want to. ,5240000
You're not going to keep on running my life the way you want it. ,7940000
KANE As far as you're concerned, Susan, I've never wanted anything - I don't want anything now - except what you want. ,353000
SUSAN What you want me to want, you mean. ,79400000
What you've decided I ought to have - what you'd want if you were me. ,6610000
But you've never given me anything that - KANE Susan, I really think - SUSAN Oh, I don't mean the things you've given me - that don't mean anything to you. ,1080000
What's the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving somebody else a hundred thousand dollars for a statue you're going to keep crated up and never look at? ,21700
It's only money. ,95200000
It doesn't mean anything. ,4360000
You're not really giving anything that belongs to you, that you care about. ,4590000
KANE (he has risen) Susan, I want you to stop this. ,165000
And right now! SUSAN Well, I'm not going to stop it. ,1950000
I'm going to say exactly what I think. (she screams) You've never given me anything. ,1610000
You've tried to buy me into giving you something. ,15500000
You're - (a sudden notion) - it's like you were bribing me! That's what it's been from the first moment I met you. ,518000
No matter how much it cost you - your time, your money - that's what you've done with everybody you've ever known. ,3330000
Tried to bribe them! KANE Susan! She looks at him, with no lessening of her passion. ,3300000
KANE You're talking an incredible amount of nonsense, Susan. (quietly) Whatever I do - I do - because I love you. ,1040000
SUSAN Love! You don't love anybody! Me or anybody else! You want to be loved - that's all you want! I'm Charles Foster Kane. ,119000
Whatever you want - just name it and it's yours! Only love me! Don't expect me to love you - Without a word, Kane slaps her across the face. ,11700
SUSAN You - you hit me. ,3670000
Kane continues to look at her. ,14800000
SUSAN You'll never have another chance to hit me again. (pauses) Never knew till this minute - KANE Susan, it seems to me - SUSAN Don't tell me you're sorry. ,184000
KANE I'm not sorry. ,7210000
SUSAN I'm going to leave you. ,2840000
KANE No, you're not. ,14800000
SUSAN (nods) Yes. ,548000
They look at each other, fixedly, but she doesn't give way. ,6540000
In fact, the camera on Kane's face shows the beginning of a startled look, as of one who sees something unfamiliar and unbelievable. ,101000
DISSOLVE: INT. KANE'S STUDY - XANADU - DAY - Kane is a the window looking out. ,17100
He turns as he hears Raymond enter. ,991000
RAYMOND Mrs. ,264000
Kane would like to see you, Mr. Kane. ,180000
Raymond waits as Kane hesitates. ,41600
KANE Is Mrs. ,12800000
Kane - (he can't finish) RAYMOND Marie has been packing since morning, Mr. Kane. ,104000
Kane impetuously walks past him out of the room. ,35800000
INT. SUSAN'S ROOM - XANADU - DAY - Packed suitcases are on the floor, Susan is completely dressed for travelling. ,20400
Kane bursts into the room. ,176000
SUSAN Tell Arnold I'm ready, Marie. ,3270000
He can get the bags. ,408000
MARIE Yes, Mrs. ,95200
Kane closes the door behind her. ,487000
KANE Have you gone completely crazy? ,99900
Susan looks at him. ,8470000
KANE Don't you realize that everybody here is going to know about this? ,9220000
That you've packed your bags and ordered the car and - SUSAN - And left? ,446000
Of course they'll hear. ,2
I'm not saying goodbye - except to you - but I never imagined that people wouldn't know. ,726000
Kane is standing against the door as if physically barring her way. ,1220000
KANE I won't let you go. ,106000000
SUSAN You can't stop me. ,709000
Kane keeps looking at her. ,722000
Susan reaches out her hand. ,6790000
SUSAN Goodbye, Charlie. ,63000
KANE (suddenly) Don't go, Susan. ,1400000
SUSAN Let's not start all over again, Charlie. ,950000
We've said everything that can be said. ,641000
KANE Susan, don't go! Susan, please! He has lost all pride. ,451000
Susan stops. ,2670
She is affected by this. ,4750000
KANE You mustn't go, Susan. ,8320000
Everything'll be exactly the way you want it. ,51900000
Not the way I think you want it - by your way. ,53800000
Please, Susan - Susan! She is staring at him. ,4040000
She might weaken. ,3290000
KANE Don't go, Susan! You mustn't go! (almost blubbering) You - you can't do this to me, Susan - It's as if he had thrown ice water into her face. ,1110
She freezes. ,51700
SUSAN I see - it's you that this is being done to! It's not me at all. ,84200000
Not how I feel. ,511000
Not what it means to me. (she laughs) I can't do this to you! (she looks at him) Oh, yes I can. ,1710000
She walks out, past Kane, who turns to watch her go, like a very tired old man. ,1260000
DISSOLVE OUT: DISSOLVE IN: INT. "EL RANCHO" CABARET - NIGHT - Susan and Thompson at a table. ,53900
There is silence between them for a moment. ,329000
SUSAN In case you've never heard of how I lost all my money - and it was plenty, believe me - THOMPSON The last ten years have been tough on a lot of people. ,819000
SUSAN They haven't been tough on me. ,3830000
I just lost my money. ,75600000
But when I compare these last ten years with the twenty I spent with him - THOMPSON I feel kind of sorry for him, all the same - SUSAN (harshly) Don't you think I do? (pause) You say you're going down to Xanadu? ,669
THOMPSON Monday, with some of the boys from the office. ,928000
Mr. Rawlston wants the whole place photographed carefully - all that art stuff. ,1700000
We run a picture magazine, you know - SUSAN I know. ,45100000
If you're smart, you'll talk to Raymond. ,44300000
That's the butler. ,11400000
You can learn a lot from him. ,884000
He knows where the bodies are buried. ,577000
She shivers. ,43000
The dawn light from the skylight above has grown brighter, making the artificial light in the night club look particularly ghastly, revealing mercilessly every year of Susan's age. ,10100
SUSAN Well, what do you know? ,88900
It's morning already. (looks at him) You must come around and tell me the story of your life sometime. ,3020000
FADE OUT: FADE IN: INT. GREAT HALL - XANADU - NIGHT - An open door shows the pantry, which is dark. ,136000
Thompson and Raymond are at a table. ,2950000
There is a pitcher of beer and a plate of sandwiches before them. ,1450000
Raymond drinks a glass of beer and settles back. ,142000
RAYMOND Yes, sir - yes, sir, I knew how to handle the old man. ,63400
He was kind of queer, but I knew how to handle him. ,4540000
THOMPSON Queer? ,859
RAYMOND Yeah. ,2840
I guess he wasn't very happy those last years - he didn't have much reason to be - DISSOLVE: INT. CORRIDOR AND TELEGRAPH OFFICE - XANADU - NIGHT - Raymond walking rapidly along corridor. ,71
He pushes open a door. ,1670000
At a desk in a fairly elaborate telegraph office sits a wireless operator named Fred. ,42700
Near him at a telephone switchboard sits a female operator named Katherine (not that it matters). ,263000
RAYMOND (reading) Mr. Charles Foster Kane announced today that Mrs. ,394000
Charles Foster Kane has left Xanadu, his Florida home, under the terms of a peaceful and friendly agreement with the intention of filing suit for divorce at an early date. ,24800
Kane said that she does not intend to return to the operatic career which she gave up a few years after her marriage, at Mr. Kane's request. ,17600
Signed, Charles Foster Kane. ,35900
Fred finishes typing and then looks up. ,2650000
RAYMOND Exclusive for immediate transmission. ,340000
Urgent priority all Kane papers. ,76700
FRED Okay. ,13600
There is the sound of the buzzer on the switchboard. ,39900
Katherine puts in a plug and answers the call. ,107000
KATHERINE Yes ... yes... ,11600000
Tinsdall - Very well. (turns to Raymond) It's the housekeeper. ,354000
RAYMOND Yes? ,11000
KATHERINE She says there's some sort of disturbance up in Mrs. ,243000
Alexander's room. ,829000
She's afraid to go in. ,133000
DISSOLVE: INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SUSAN'S BEDROOM - XANADU - NIGHT - The housekeeper, Mrs. ,8040
Tinsdall, and a couple of maids are near the door but are too afraid to be in front of it. ,18200
From inside can be heard a terrible banging and crashing. ,173000
Raymond hurries into scene, opens the door and goes in. ,88900
INT. SUSAN'S BEDROOM - XANADU - Kane, in a truly terrible and absolutely silent rage, is literally breaking up the room - yanking pictures, hooks and all off the wall, smashing them to bits - ugly, gaudy pictures - Susie's pictures in Susie's bad taste. ,53
Off of occasional tables, bureaus, he sweeps Susie's whorish accumulation of bric-a-brac. ,39
Raymond stands in the doorway watching him. ,188000
Kane says nothing. ,43
He continues with tremendous speed and surprising strength, still wordlessly, tearing the room to bits. ,18300
The curtains (too frilly - overly pretty) are pulled off the windows in a single gesture, and from the bookshelves he pulls down double armloads of cheap novels - discovers a half-empty bottle of liquor and dashes it across the room. ,267
Finally he stops. ,10200000
Susie's cozy little chamber is an incredible shambles all around him. ,7850
He stands for a minute breathing heavily, and his eye lights on a hanging what-not in a corner which had escaped his notice. ,3880
Prominent on its center shelf is the little glass ball with the snowstorm in it. ,20500
He yanks it down. ,1030000
Something made of china breaks, but not the glass ball. ,5160000
It bounces on the carpet and rolls to his feet, the snow in a flurry. ,92400
His eye follows it. ,58600
He stoops to pick it up - can't make it. ,13600000
Raymond picks it up for him; hands it to him. ,708000
Kane takes it sheepishly - looks at it - moves painfully out of the room into the corridor. ,12200
INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SUSAN'S BEDROOM - XANADU - Kane comes out of the door. ,101000
Tinsdall has been joined now by a fairly sizable turnout of servants. ,12100
They move back away from Kane, staring at him. ,728000
Raymond is in the doorway behind Kane. ,20700
Kane looks at the glass ball. ,403000
KANE (without turning) Close the door, Raymond. ,220000
RAYMOND Yes, sir. (he closes it) KANE Lock it - and keep it locked. ,31900
Raymond locks the door and comes to his side. ,370000
There is a long pause - servants staring in silence. ,84300
Kane gives the glass ball a gentle shake and starts another snowstorm. ,42800
KANE Raymond - (he is almost in a trance) RAYMOND Yes, sir - One of the younger servants giggles and is hushed up. ,26900
Kane shakes the ball again. ,99400
Another flurry of snow. ,351000
He watches the flakes settle - then looks up. ,265000
Finally, taking in the pack of servants and something of the situations, he puts the glass ball in his coat pocket. ,8790
He speaks very quietly to Raymond, so quietly it only seems he's talking to himself. ,31800
KANE Keep it locked. ,7270000
He slowly walks off down the corridor, the servants giving way to let him pass, and watching him as he goes. ,20800
He is an old, old man! DISSOLVE: INT. KANE'S CHAPEL - XANADU - LATE AFTERNOON - As the dissolve completes itself, camera is travellling across the floor of the chapel past the crypts of Kane's father and mother - (marked: James Kane - 18- TO 19-; Mary Kane - 18- TO 19-;) - past a blank crypt, and then holding on the burial of Kane's son. ,8080
A group of ordinary workmen in ordinary clothes are lowering a very expensive-looking coffin into its crypt. ,12000
Kane stands nearby with Raymond, looking on. ,782000
The men strain and grunt as the coffin bangs on the stone floor. ,6220
The men now place over it a long marble slab on which is cut the words: CHARLES FOSTER KANE II. 1907 - 1938 ONE OF THE WORKMEN Sorry, Mr. Kane, we won't be able to cement it till tommorrow. ,51
We - Kane looks right through him. ,1110000
Raymond cuts him short. ,335000
RAYMOND Okay. ,1570
The men tip their hats and shuffle out of the chapel. ,1810000
Kane raises his head, looks at the inscription on the wall. ,455000
It is a little to one side of Junior's grave, directly over the blank place which will be occupied by Kane himself. ,20200
KANE Do you like poetry, Raymond? ,19700000
RAYMOND Can't say, sir. ,4800000
KANE Mrs. ,8000
Kane liked poetry - Raymond is now convinced that the old master is very far gone indeed - not to say off his trolley. ,42500
RAYMOND Yes, Mr. Kane. ,86000
KANE Not my wife - not either of them. ,2220000
He looks at the grave next to his son's - the grave marked "MARY KANE." RAYMOND (catching on) Oh, yes, sir. ,30300
KANE (looking back up at the wall) Do you know what that is? ,2090000
RAYMOND (more his keeper than his butler now) It's a wall you bought in China, Mr. Kane. ,101000
KANE Persia. ,7220
It belonged to a king. ,1360000
RAYMOND How did you get him to part with it, Mr. Kane? ,103000000
KANE He was dead... ,4120000
That's a poem. ,15400000
Do you know what it means? ,16200000
RAYMOND No, I don't, Mr. Kane. ,183000
KANE I didn't used to be afraid of it. ,2900000
His eyes still on the wall, but looking through it, Kane quotes the translation. ,321000
KANE The drunkeness of youth has passed like a fever, And yet I saw many things, Seeing my glory in the days of my glory, I thought my power eternal And the days of my life Fixed surely in the years But a whisper came to me From Him who dies not. ,8120
I called my tributary kings together And those who were proud rulers under me, I opened the boxes of my treasure to them, saying: "Take hills of gold, moutains of silver, And give me only one more day upon the earth." But they stood silent, Looking upon the ground; So that I died And Death came to sit upon my throne. ,7850
O sons of men You see a stranger upon the road, You call to him and he does not step. ,448000
He is your life Walking towards time, Hurrying to meet the kings of India and China. (quoting) O sons of men You are caught in the web of the world And the spider Nothing waits behind it. ,1290
Where are the men with towering hopes? ,3350000
They have changed places with owls, Owls who have lived in tombs And now inhabit a palace. ,139000
Kane still stares at the wall, through it, and way beyond it. ,375000
Raymond looks at him. ,1900000
DISSOLVE OUT: DISSOLVE IN: INT. GREAT HALL - XANADU - NIGHT - Thompson and Raymond. ,21500
Raymond has finished his beer. ,43000
RAYMOND (callously) That's the whole works, right up to date. ,45500000
THOMPSON Sentimental fellow, aren't you? ,18600
RAYMOND Yes and no. ,9
THOMPSON (getting to his feet) Well, thanks a lot. ,36800
RAYMOND See what I mean? ,1220000
He was a little gone in the head - the last couple of years, anyway - but I knew how to handle him. (rises) That "Rosebud" - that don't mean anything. ,46800
I heard him say it. ,69300
He just said "Rosebud" and then he dropped that glass ball and it broke on the floor. ,309000
He didn't say anything about that, so I knew he was dead - He said all kind of things I couldn't make out. ,409000
But I knew how to take care of him. ,32600
Thompson doesn't answer. ,3030000
RAYMOND You can go on asking questions if you want to. ,4270000
THOMPSON (coldly) We're leaving tonight. ,4120000
As soon as they're through photographing the stuff - Thompson has risen. ,754000
Raymond gets to his feet and goes to the door, opening it for him. ,643000
RAYMOND Allow yourself plenty of time. ,2240000
The train stops at the Junction On signal - but they don't like to wait. ,6060000
Not now. ,7680000
I can remember when they'd wait all day ... if Mr. Kane said so. ,1100000
Raymond ushes Thompson into INT. THE GREAT HALL - XANADU - NIGHT - The magnificent tapestries, candelabra, etc., are still there, but now several large packing cases are piled against the walls, some broken open, some shut and a number of objects, great and small, are piled pell mell all over the place. ,26
Furniture, statues, paintings, bric-a-brac - things of obviously enormous value are standing beside a kitchen stove, an old rocking chair and other junk, among which is also an old sled, the self-same story. ,17
Somewhere in the back, one of the vast Gothic windows of the hall is open and a light wind blows through the scene, rustling the papers. ,30600
In the center of the hall, a Photographer and his Assistant are busy photographing the sundry objects. ,24400
The floor is littered with burnt-out flash bulbs. ,4300
They continue their work throughout the early part of the scene so that now and then a flash bulb goes off. ,451000
In addition to the Photographer and his Assistant, there are a Girl and Two Newspaperment - the Second and Third Men of the projection room scene - also Thompson and Raymond. ,29900
The Girl and the Second Man, who wears a hat, are dancing somewhere in the back of the hall to the music of a phonograph. ,16800
A flash bulb goes off. ,7670000
The Photographer has just photographed a picture, obviously of great value, an Italian primitive. ,283000
The Assistant consults a label on the back of it. ,22000
ASSISTANT NO. 9182 The Third Newspaperman starts to jot this information down. ,63400
ASSISTANT "Nativity" - attributed to Donatello, acquired Florence 1921, cost 45,000 lira. ,359000
Got that? ,4730000
THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN Yeah. ,21200
PHOTOGRAPHER All right! Next! Better get that statue over there. ,1710000
ASSISTANT Okay. ,2880
The Photographer and his Assitant start to move off with their equipment towards a large sculpture in another part of the hall. ,22800
RAYMOND What do you think all that is worth, Mr. Thompson? ,4040000
THOMPSON Millions - if anybody wants it. ,30300
RAYMOND The banks are out of luck, eh? ,109000
THOMPSON Oh, I don't know. ,12600000
They'll clear all right. ,58200000
ASSISTANT "Venus," Fourth Century. ,918000
Acquired 1911. ,980
Cost twenty-three thousand. ,8310000
Got it? ,13900000
THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN Okay. ,37800
ASSISTANT (patting the statue on the fanny) That's a lot of money to pay for a dame without a head. ,9000
SECOND ASSISTANT (reading a label) No. 483. ,15900000
One desk from the estate of Mary Kane, Little Salem, Colorado. ,1
Value $6.00. ,13900000
THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN Okay. ,38000
A flashlight bulb goes off. ,255000
SECOND ASSISTANT We're all set to get everything. ,1250000
The junk as well as the art. ,5420000
Thompson has opened a box and is idly playing with a handful of little pieces of cardboard. ,9840
THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN What's that? ,26000000
RAYMOND It's a jigsaw puzzle. ,1820000
THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN We got a lot of those. ,24100000
There's a Burmese Temple and three Spanish ceilings down the hall. ,301000
Raymond laughs. ,842
PHOTOGRAPHER Yeah, all in crates. ,124000
THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN There's a part of a Scotch castle over there, but we haven't bothered to unwrap it. ,10700
PHOTOGRAPHER I wonder how they put all those pieces together? ,1
ASSISTANT (reading a label) Iron stove. ,492000
Estate of Mary Kane. ,2680000
Value $2.00. ,13900000
PHOTOGRAPHER Put it over by that statue. ,850000
It'll make a good setup. ,125000
GIRL (calling out) Who is she anyway? ,5570000
SECOND NEWSPAPERMAN Venus. ,66800
She always is. ,54300
THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN He sure liked to collect things, didn't he? ,1480000
RAYMOND He went right on buying - right up to the end. ,1
PHOTOGRAPHER Anything and everything - he was a regular crow. ,1770000
THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN wonder - You put all this together - the palaces and the paintings and the toys and everything - what would it spell? ,9510
Thompson has turned around. ,2350000
He is facing the camera for the first time. ,479000
THOMPSON Charles Foster Kane. ,33700
Another flash bulb goes off. ,361000
The Photographer turns to Thompson with a grin. ,61100
PHOTOGRAPHER Or Rosebud? ,211000
How about it, Jerry? ,15700000
THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN (to the dancers) Turn that thing off, will you? ,73400000
It's driving me nuts! What's Rosebud? ,1810000
PHOTOGRAPHER Kane's last words, aren't they, Jerry? (to the Third Newspaperman) That was Jerry's angle, wasn't it, Jerry? ,2710
Did you ever find out what it means, Jerry? ,2140000
THOMPSON No, I didn't. ,8540000
The music has stopped. ,6320000
The dancers have come over to Thompson. ,148000
SECOND NEWSPAPERMAN Say, what did you find out about him, anyway, Jerry? ,205000
THOMPSON Not much. ,12400000
SECOND NEWSPAPERMAN Well, what have you been doing? ,87800000
THOMPSON Playing with a jigsaw puzzle - I talked to a lot of people who knew him. ,37900
GIRL What do they say? ,54400000
THOMPSON Well - it's become a very clear picture. ,25300000
He was the most honest man who ever lived, with a streak of crookedness a yard wide. ,8410
He was a liberal and a reactionary; he was tolerant - "Live and Let Live" - that was his motto. ,14300
But he had no use for anybody who disagreed with him on any point, no matter how small it was. ,2440000
He was a loving husband and a good father - and both his wives left him and his son got himself killed about as shabbily as you can do it. ,384000
Outside of that - THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN Okay, okay. ,12200
GIRL What about Rosebud? ,5820000
Don't you think that explains anything? ,2970000
THOMPSON No, I don't. ,115000000
Not much anway. ,43700
Charles Foster Kane was a man who got everything he wanted, and then lost it. ,242000
Maybe Rosebud was something he couldn't get or lost. ,2930000
No, I don't think it explains anything. ,12000000
I don't think any word explains a man's life. ,2140000
No - I guess Rosebud is just a piece in a jigsaw puzzle - a missing piece. ,76800
He drops the jigsaw pieces back into the box, looking at his watch. ,1580000
THOMPSON We'd better get along. ,4570000
We'll miss the train. ,57400000
He picks up his overcoat - it has been resting on a little sled - the little sled young Charles Foster Kane hit Thatcher with at the opening of the picture. ,2240
Camera doesn't close in on this. ,138000
It just registers the sled as the newspaper people, picking up their clothes and equipment, move out of the great hall. ,54600
DISSOLVE: INT. CELLAR - XANADU - NIGHT - A large furnace, with an open door, dominates the scene. ,12100
Two laborers, with shovels, are shovelling things into the furnace. ,18100
Raymond is about ten feet away. ,258000
RAYMOND Throw that junk in, too. ,971000
Camera travels to the pile that he has indicated. ,5
It is mostly bits of broken packing cases, excelsior, etc. ,305000
The sled is on top of the pile. ,164000
As camera comes close, it shows the faded rosebud and, though the letters are faded, unmistakably the word "ROSEBUD" across it. ,12300
The laborer drops his shovel, takes the sled in his hand and throws it into the furnace. ,12200
The flames start to devour it. ,60700
Smoke is coming from a chimney. ,8
Camera reverses the path it took at the beginning of the picture, perhaps omitting some of the stages. ,57200
It moves finally through the gates, which close behind it. ,100000
As camera pauses for a moment, the letter "K" is prominent in the moonlight. ,44300
Just before we fade out, there comes again into the picture the pattern of barbed wire and cyclone fencing. ,5060
On the fence is a sign which reads: "PRIVATE - NO TRESPASSING" ,186000
There is a moment's hesitation, and then the simple words in white lettering: THE GODFATHER While this remains, we hear: "I believe in America." Suddenly we are watching in CLOSE VIEW, AMERIGO BONASERA, a man of sixty, dressed in a black suit, on the verge of great emotion. ,55
BONASERA America has made my fortune. ,54000000
As he speaks, THE VIEW imperceptibly begins to loosen. ,64200
BONASERA I raised my daughter in the American fashion; I gave her freedom, but taught her never to dishonor her family. ,5900
She found a boy friend, not an Italian. ,2780000
She went to the movies with him, stayed out late. ,175
Two months ago he took her for a drive, with another boy friend. ,527000
They made her drink whiskey and then they tried to take advantage of her. ,250000
She resisted; she kept her honor. ,4320
So they beat her like an animal. ,9290000
When I went to the hospital her nose was broken, her jaw was shattered and held together by wire, and she could not even weep because of the pain. ,151
He can barely speak; he is weeping now. ,104000
BONASERA I went to the Police like a good American. ,206000
These two boys were arrested and brought to trial. ,444000
The judge sentenced them to three years in prison, and suspended the sentence. ,2470000
Suspended sentence! They went free that very day. ,1500000
I stood in the courtroom like a fool, and those bastards, they smiled at me. ,13400
Then I said to my wife, for Justice, we must go to The Godfather. ,28
By now, THE VIEW is full, and we see Don Corleone's office in his home. ,38
The blinds are closed, and so the room is dark, and with patterned shadows. ,591000
We are watching BONASERA over the shoulder of DON CORLEONE. TOM HAGEN sits near a small table, examining some paperwork, and SONNY CORLEONE stands impatiently by the window nearest his father, sipping from a glass of wine. ,33
We can HEAR music, and the laughter and voices of many people outside. ,892000
DON CORLEONE Bonasera, we know each other for years, but this is the first time you come to me for help. ,2940000
I don't remember the last time you invited me to your house for coffee...even though our wives are friends. ,600000
BONASERA What do you want of me? ,99500000
I'll give you anything you want, but do what I ask! DON CORLEONE And what is that Bonasera? ,150
BONASERA whispers into the DON's ear. ,85700
DON CORLEONE No. You ask for too much. ,107000
BONASERA I ask for Justice. ,342000
DON CORLEONE The Court gave you justice. ,3220000
BONASERA An eye for an eye! DON CORLEONE But your daughter is still alive. ,143
BONASERA Then make them suffer as she suffers. ,504000
How much shall I pay you. ,172000
Both HAGEN and SONNY react. ,4270000
DON CORLEONE You never think to protect yourself with real friends. ,940000
You think it's enough to be an American. ,48900
All right, the Police protects you, there are Courts of Law, so you don't need a friend like me. ,992000
But now you come to me and say Don Corleone, you must give me justice. ,2290000
And you don't ask in respect or friendship. ,8290000
And you don't think to call me Godfather; instead you come to my house on the day my daughter is to be married and you ask me to do murder...for money. ,967000
BONASERA America has been good to me... ,2990000
DON CORLEONE Then take the justice from the judge, the bitter with the sweet, Bonasera. ,12300
But if you come to me with your friendship, your loyalty, then your enemies become my enemies, and then, believe me, they would fear you... ,459000
Slowly, Bonasera bows his head and murmurs. ,13000
BONASERA Be my friend. ,182000
DON CORLEONE Good. ,1010000
From me you'll get Justice. ,35600000
BONASERA Godfather. ,94
DON CORLEONE Some day, and that day may never come, I would like to call upon you to do me a service in return. ,2270000
EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945) A HIGH ANGLE of the CORLEONE MALL in bright daylight. ,51500
There are at least five hundred guests filling the main courtyard and gardens. ,155000
There is music and laughing and dancing and countless tables covered with food and wine. ,753000
DON CORLEONE stands at the Gate, flanked on either side by a son: FREDO and SONNY, all dressed in the formal attire of the wedding party. ,53900
He warmly shakes the hands, squeezes the hands of the friends and guests, pinches the cheeks of the children, and makes them all welcome. ,12300
They in turn carry with them gallons of homemade wine, cartons of freshly baked bread and pastries, and enormous trays of Italian delicacies. ,3220
The entire family poses for a family portrait: DON CORLEONE, MAMA, SONNY, his wife, SANDRA, and their children, TOM HAGEN and his wife, THERESA, and their BABY; CONSTANZIA, the bride, and her bridegroom, CARLO RIZZI. As they move into the pose, THE DON seems preoccupied. ,29
DON CORLEONE Where's Michael? ,24
SONNY He'll be here Pop, it's still early. ,2210000
DON CORLEONE Then the picture will wait for him. ,9360000
Everyone in the group feels the uneasiness as the DON moves back to the house. ,766000
SONNY gives a delicious smile in the direction of the Maid-of-Honor, LUCY MANCINI. She returns it. ,59500
Then he moves to his wife. ,657000
SONNY Sandra, watch the kids. ,243000
They're running wild. ,9920000
SANDRA You watch yourself. ,53700
HAGEN kisses his WIFE, and follows THE DON, passing the wine barrels, where a group of FOUR MEN nervously wait. ,13300
TOM crooks a finger at NAZORINE, who doublechecks that he is next, straightens, and follows HAGEN. EXT DAY: MALL ENTRANCE (SUMMER 1945) Outside the main gate of the Mall, SEVERAL MEN in suits, working together with a MAN in a dark sedan, walk in and out of the rows of parked cars, writing license plate numbers down in their notebooks. ,26
We HEAR the music and laughter coming from the party in the distance. ,151000
A MAN stops at a limousine and copies down the number. ,612000
BARZINI, dignified in a black homburg, is always under the watchful eyes of TWO BODYGUARDS as he makes his way to embrace DON CORLEONE in the courtyard. ,12200
The MEN walk down another row of parked cars. ,4400000
Put another number in the notebook. ,2530000
A shiney new Cadillac with wooden bumpers. ,732000
PETER CLEMENZA, dancing the Tarantella joyously, bumping bellies with the ladies. ,36
CLEMENZA Paulie...wine...WINE. He mops his sweating forehead with a big handkerchief. ,94
PAULIE hustles, gets a glass of icy black wine, and brings it to him. ,14
PAULIE You look terrif on the floor! CLEMENZA What are you, a dance judge? ,6390
Go do your job; take a walk around the neighborhood... see everything is okay. ,32500
PAULIE nods and leaves; CLEMENZA takes a breath, and leaps back into the dance. ,47000
The MEN walk down another row of parked cars. ,4400000
Put another number in the notebook. ,2530000
TESSIO, a tall, gentle-looking man, dances with a NINE-YEAR- OLD GIRL, her little black party shoes planted on his enormous brown shoes. ,2360
The MEN move on to other parked cars, when SONNY storms out of the gate, his face flushed with anger, followed by CLEMENZA and PAULIE. SONNY Buddy, this is a private party. ,534
The MAN doesn't answer, but points to the DRIVER of the sedan. ,757000
SONNY menacingly thrusts his reddened face at him. ,1130
The DRIVER merely flips open his wallet to a greed card, without saying a word. ,7280
SONNY steps back, spits on the ground, turns, and walks away, followed by CLEMENZA, PAULIE, and another TWO MEN. He doesn't say a thing for most of the walk back into the courtyard, and then, muttered to PAULIE. SONNY Goddamn FBI...don't respect nothing. ,27
INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945) DON CORLEONE sits quietly behind his massive desk in the dark study. ,26600
NAZORINE ...a fine boy from Sicily, captured by the American Army, and sent to New Jersey as a prisoner of war... ,6740
DON CORLEONE Nazorine, my friend, tell me what I can do. ,2700000
NAZORINE Now that the war is over, Enzo, this boy is being repatriated to Italy. ,19200
And you see, Godfather... (he wrings his hands, unable to express himself) He...my daughter...they... ,4950
DON CORLEONE You want him to stay in this country. ,52000000
NAZORINE Godfather, you understand everything. ,15
DON CORLEONE Tom, what we need is an Act of Congress to allow Enzo to become a citizen. ,186000
NAZORINE (impressed) An Act of Congress! HAGEN (nodding) It will cost. ,10600
The DON shrugs; such are the way with those things; NAZORINE nods. ,44100
NAZORINE Is that all? ,11300
Godfather, thank you... (backing out, enthusiastically) Oh, wait till you see the cake I made for your beautiful daughter! NAZORINE backs out, all smiles, and nods to the GODFATHER. DON CORLEONE rises and moves to the Venetian blinds. ,44
HAGEN Who do I give this job to? ,395000
The DON moves to the windows, peeking out through the blinds. ,35500
DON CORLEONE Not to one of our paisans...give it to a Jew Congressman in another district. ,12
Who else is on the list for today? ,145000000
The DON is peeking out to the MEN around the barrel, waiting to see him. ,104000
HAGEN Francesco Nippi. ,1830
His nephew has been refused parole. ,4290000
A bad case. ,528000
EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945) WHAT HE SEES: NIPPI waits nervously by the barrel. ,34300
HAGEN (O.S.) His father worked with you in the freight yards when you were young. ,20300
LUCA BRASI sitting alone, grotesque and quiet. ,10400
HAGEN (O.S.) He's not on the list, but Luca Brasi wants to see you. ,34900
INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945) The DON turns to HAGEN. DON CORLEONE Is it necessary? ,120000
HAGEN You understand him better than anyone. ,301000
The DON nods to this. ,1070000
Turns back to the blinds and peeks out. ,20000
EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945) WHAT HE SEES: MICHAEL CORLEONE, dressed in the uniform of a Marine Captain, leads KAY ADAMS through the wedding crowd, occasionally stopped and greeted by FRIENDS of the family. ,347
INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945) The DON, inside the office, peering through the blinds, following them. ,4750
EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945) MICHAEL moves through the crowd, embraces MAMA and introduces her to his GIRL. EXT DAY: OFFICE WINDOW (SUMMER 1945) The DON's eyes peering through the blinds. ,2
EXT DAY: MALL TABLES (SUMMER 1945) KAY and MICHAEL settle by a table on the edge of the wedding, burdened down with plates of food and glasses and wine. ,21400
She is exhilarated by the enormity of the affair, the music and the vitality. ,12900
KAY I've never seen anything like it. ,5
MICHAEL I told you I had a lot of relatives. ,1790000
KAY looking about, a young and lively thing in a gift shop. ,690000
We see what she sees: Her interest is caught by THREE MEN standing by the wine barrels. ,9630
KAY (amused) Michael, what are those men doing? ,14400
MICHAEL They're waiting to see my father. ,1650000
KAY They're talking to themselves. ,1750000
MICHAEL They're going to talk to my father, which means they're going to ask him for something, which means they better get it right. ,2400000
KAY Why do they bother him on a day like this? ,2620000
MICHAEL Because they know that no Sicilian will refuse a request on his daughter's wedding day. ,99900
EXT DAY: WEDDING PARTY (SUMMER 1945) CONNIE CORLEONE, the Bride, is pressing the bodice of her overly-fluffy white gown against the groom, CARLO RIZZI. He is bronzed, with curly blondish hair and lovely dimples. ,25
She absolutely adores him and can barely take her eyes from him long enough to thank the various GUESTS for the white envelopes they are putting into the large white purse she holds. ,5740
In fact, if we watch carefully, we can see that one of her hands is slid under his jacket, and into his shirt, where she is provocatively rubbing the hair on his chest. ,9640
CARLO, on the other hand, has his blue eyes trained on the bulging envelopes, and is trying to guess how much cash the things hold. ,11
Discreetly, he moves her hand off of his skin. ,221000
CARLO (whispered) Cut it out, Connie. ,13000
The purse, looped by a ribbon of silk around CONNIE's arm, is fat with money. ,413000
PAULIE (O.S.) What do you think? ,14
Twenty grand? ,70500
A little distance away, a young man, PAULIE GATTO, catches a prosciutto sandwich thrown by a friend, without once taking eyes from the purse. ,9
PAULIE Who knows? ,2280000
Maybe more. ,562000
Twenty, thirty grand in small bills cash in that silk purse. ,105000
Holy Toledo, if this was somebody else's wedding! SONNY is sitting at the Wedding Dias, talking to LUCY MANCINI, the Maid of Honor. ,33
Every once in a while he glances across the courtyard, where his WIFE is talking with some WOMEN. He bends over and whispers something into LUCY's ear. ,774
SANDRA and the WOMEN are in the middle of a big, ribald laugh. ,204000
WOMAN Is it true what they say about your husband, Sandra? ,5700000
SANDRA's hands separate with expanding width further and further apart until she bursts into a peal of laughter. ,38700
Through her separated hands she sees the Wedding Dais. ,127000
SONNY and LUCY are gone. ,2880000
INT DAY: DON'S HALL & STAIRS (SUMMER 1945) The empty hallway. ,79500000
The bathroom door opens and LUCY surreptitiously steps out. ,282000
She looks up where SONNY is standing on the second landing, motioning for her to come up. ,10
She lifts her petticoats off the ground and hurries upstairs. ,390
EXT DAY: MALL TABLES (SUMMER 1945) KAY and MICHAEL. KAY (in a spooky low tone) Michael, that scarey guy...Is he a relative? ,26
She has picked out LUCA BRASI. MICHAEL No. His name is Luca Brasi. ,135000
You wouldn't like him. ,32600000
KAY (Excited) Who is he? ,1290000
MICHAEL (Sizing her up) You really want to know? ,3080000
KAY Yes. ,8620000
MICHAEL You like spaghetti? ,6240000
KAY You know I love spaghetti. ,2320000
MICHAEL Then eat your spaghetti and I'll tell you a Luca Brasi story. ,9330
She starts to eat her spaghetti. ,332000
She begins eating, looking at him eagerly. ,2670000
MICHAEL Once upon a time, about fifteen years ago some people wanted to take over my father's olive oil business. ,42800
They had Al Capone send some men in from Chicago to kill my father, and they almost did. ,100000
KAY Al Capone! MICHAEL My Father sent Luca Brasi after them. ,29200
He tied the two Capone men hand and foot, and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths. ,2280
Then he took an ax, and chopped one man's feet off... ,99200
KAY Michael... ,50200
MICHAEL Then the legs at the knees... ,177000
KAY Michael you're trying to scare me... ,3200000
MICHAEL Then the thighs where they joined the torso. ,24
KAY Michael, I don't want to hear anymore... ,1710000
MICHAEL Then Luca turned to the other man... ,485000
KAY Michael, I love you. ,962000
MICHAEL ...who out of sheer terror had swallowed the bath towel in his mouth and suffocated. ,11500
The smile on his face seems to indicate that he is telling a tall story. ,456000
KAY I never know when you're telling me the truth. ,13
MICHAEL I told you you wouldn't like him. ,1270000
KAY He's coming over here! LUCA comes toward them to meet TOM HAGEN halfway, just near their table. ,20700
MICHAEL Tom...Tom, I'd like you to meet Kay Adams. ,200000
KAY (having survived LUCA) How do you do. ,29100
MICHAEL My brother, Tom Hagen. ,4290000
HAGEN Hello Kay. ,1760000
Your father's inside, doing some business. (privately) He's been asking for you. ,1680000
MICHAEL Thanks Tom. ,14700000
HAGEN smiles and moves back to the house, LUCA ominously following. ,24
KAY If he's your brother, why does he have a different name? ,11100000
MICHAEL My brother Sonny found him living in the streets when he was a kid, so my father took him in. ,77700
He's a good lawyer. ,31
INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945) DON CORLEONE at the window. ,185000
He has seen the intimacy of the YOUNG COUPLE. LUCA (O.S.) Don Corleone... ,10
THE DON turns to the stiffly formal LUCA, and he moves forward to kiss his hand. ,30600
He takes the envelope from his jacket, holds it out, but does not release it until he makes a formal speech. ,1030000
LUCA (with difficulty) Don Corleone...I am honored, and grateful...that you invited me to your home...on the wedding day of your...daughter. ,13300
May their first child...be a masculine child. ,52900000
I pledge my never ending loyalty. (he offers the envelope) For your daughter's bridal purse. ,6830
DON CORLEONE Thank you, Luca, my most valued friend. ,12700000
THE DON takes it, and then LUCA's hand, which he squeezes so tightly we might imagine it to be painful. ,6310
LUCA Let me leave you, Don Corleone. ,11
I know you are busy. ,146000000
He turns, almost an about-face, and leaves the study with the same formality he entered with. ,73900
DON CORLEONE breathes more easily, and gives the thick envelope to HAGEN. DON CORLEONE I'm sure it's the most generous gift today. ,129000
HAGEN The Senator called--apologized for not coming personally, but said you'd understand. ,12
Also, some of the Judges...they've all sent gifts. ,2840000
And another call from Virgil Sollozzo. ,3360
DON CORLEONE is not pleased. ,13300
HAGEN The action is narcotics. ,3020000
Sollozzo has contacts in Turkey for the poppy, in Sicily for the plants to process down to morphine or up to heroin. ,1620
Also he has access to this country. ,50100000
He's coming to us for financial help, and some sort of immunity from the law. ,1560000
For that we get a piece of the action, I couldn't find out how much. ,78400000
Sollozzo is vouched for by the Tattaglia family, and they may have a piece of the action. ,3460
They call Sollozzo the Turk. ,7850
He's spent a lot of time in Turkey and is suppose to have a Turkish wife and kids. ,345000
He's suppose to be very quick with the knife, or was, when he was younger. ,1590000
Only in matters of business and with some reasonable complaint. ,21000000
Also he has an American wife and three children and he is a good family man. ,26700000
THE DON nods. ,416
HAGEN He's his own boss, and very competent. ,2440000
DON CORLEONE And with prison record. ,23300
HAGEN Two terms; one in Italy, one in the United States. ,7
He's known to the Government as a top narcotics man. ,1530000
That could be a plus for us; he could never get immunity to testify. ,167000
DON CORLEONE When did he call? ,52400000
HAGEN This morning. ,13200000
DON CORLEONE On a day like this. ,330000
Consiglero, do you also have in your notes the the Turk made his living from Prostitution before the war, like the Tattaglias do now. ,3140
Write that down before you forget it. ,533000
The Turk will wait. ,14500000
We now begin to hear a song coming over the loud-speakers from outside. ,1160000
In Italian, with unmistakable style. ,10
DON CORLEONE What that? ,1010000
It sounds like Johnny. ,1070
He moves to the window, pulls the blinds up, flooding the room with light. ,19100
DON CORLEONE It is Johnny. ,153000
He came all the way from California to be at the wedding. ,2790000
HAGEN Should I bring him in. ,75200
DON CORLEONE No. Let the people enjoy him. ,4700000
You see? ,15700000
He is a good godson. ,339000
HAGEN It's been two years. ,358000
He's probably in trouble again. ,4360000
EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945) JOHNNY FONTANE on the bandstand, singing to the delight and excitement of the wedding GUESTS. KAY I didn't know your family knew Johnny Fontane. ,27
MICHAEL Sure. ,34800
KAY I used to come down to New York whenever he sang at the Capitol and scream my head off. ,20900
MICHAEL He's my father's godson; he owes him his whole career. ,156000
JOHNNY finishes the song and the CROWD screams with delight. ,48300
They call out for another when DON CORLEONE appears. ,23
DON CORLEONE My Godson has come three thousand miles to do us honor and no one thinks to wet his throat. ,25900
At once a dozen wine glasses are offered to JOHNNY, who takes a sip from each as he moves to embrace his GODFATHER. JOHNNY I kept trying to call you after my divorce and Tom always said you were busy. ,33200
When I got the Wedding invitation I knew you weren't sore at me anymore, Godfather. ,25600
DON CORLEONE Can I do something for you still? ,37400000
You're not too rich, or too famous that I can't help you? ,7490000
JOHNNY I'm not rich anymore, Godfather, and...my career, I'm almost washed up... ,1380000
He's very disturbed. ,545000
The GODFATHER indicates that he come with him to the office so no one will notice. ,421000
He turns to HAGEN. DON CORLEONE Tell Santino to come in with us. ,15700
He should hear some things. ,13
They go, leaving HAGEN scanning the party looking for SONNY. INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945) HAGEN glances up the staircase. ,5140
HAGEN Sonny? ,3230
Then he goes up. ,15600000
INT DAY: DON'S UPSTAIRS ROOM (SUMMER 1945) SONNY and LUCY are in a room upstairs; he has lifted her gown's skirts almost over her head, and has her standing against the door. ,840
Her face peeks out from the layers of petticoats around it like a flower in ecstasy. ,316000
LUCY Sonnyeeeeeeee. ,21
Her head bouncing against the door with the rhythm of his body. ,306000
But there is a knocking as well. ,1980000
They stop, freeze in that position. ,50500
HAGEN (O.S.) Sonny? ,2700000
Sonny, you in there? ,13
INT DAY: DON'S UPSTAIRS HALLWAY (SUMMER 1945) Outside, HAGEN by the door. ,6880
HAGEN The old man wants you; Johnny's here...he's got a problem. ,315000
SONNY (O.S.) Okay. ,3290000
One minute. ,5640000
HAGEN hesitates. ,29
We HEAR LUCY's head bouncing against the door again. ,82500
TOM leaves. ,16200
INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945) DON CORLEONE ACT LIKE A MAN! By Christ in Heaven, is it possible you turned out no better than a Hollywood finocchio. ,767
Both HAGEN and JOHNNY cannot refrain from laughing. ,10900
The DON smiles. ,17000000
SONNY enters as noiselessly as possible, still adjusting his clothes. ,22200
DON CORLEONE All right, Hollywood...Now tell me about this Hollywood Pezzonovanta who won't let you work. ,1200000
JOHNNY He owns the studio. ,6740000
Just a month ago he bought the movie rights to this book, a best seller. ,26400000
And the main character is a guy just like me. ,2490000
I wouldn't even have to act, just be myself. ,85200
The DON is silent, stern. ,19700000
DON CORLEONE You take care of your family? ,7
JOHNNY Sure. ,13700
He glances at SONNY, who makes himself as inconspicuous as he can. ,333000
DON CORLEONE You look terrible. ,37700
I want you to eat well, to rest. ,77200000
And spend time with your family. ,5210000
And then, at the end of the month, this big shot will give you the part you want. ,23400000
JOHNNY It's too late. ,56400000
All the contracts have been signed, they're almost ready to shoot. ,1050000
DON CORLEONE I'll make him an offer he can't refuse. ,39900000
He takes JOHNNY to the door, pinching his cheek hard enough to hurt. ,760000
DON CORLEONE Now go back to the party and leave it to me. ,19600000
He closes the door, smiling to himself. ,1
Turns to HAGEN. DON CORLEONE When does my daughter leave with her bridegroom? ,5
HAGEN They'll cut the cake in a few minutes...leave right after that. ,54900000
Your new son-in-law, do we give him something important? ,489000
DON CORLEONE No, give him a living. ,17200000
But never let him know the family's business. ,7750000
What else, Tom? ,15400000
HAGEN I've called the hospital; they've notified Consiglere Genco's family to come and wait. ,3830
He won't last out the night. ,74700000
This saddens the DON. He sighs. ,1020000
DON CORLEONE Genco will wait for me. ,11900000
Santino, tell your brothers they will come with me to the hospital to see Genco. ,39100
Tell Fredo to drive the big car, and ask Johnny to come with us. ,645000
SONNY And Michael? ,16200000
DON CORLEONE All my sons. (to HAGEN) Tom, I want you to go to California tonight. ,331000
Make the arrangements. ,18800000
But don't leave until I come back from the hospital and speak to you. ,3
HAGEN Understood. ,94
EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945) Now all the wedding GUESTS excitedly clap their hands over the entrance of the cake: NAZORINE is beaming as he wheels in a serving table containing the biggest, gaudiest, most extravagant wedding cake ever baked, an incredible monument of his gratitude. ,23
The CROWD is favorably impressed: they begin to clink their knives or forks against their glasses, in the traditional request for the Bride to cut the cake and kiss the Groom. ,2660
Louder and louder, five hundred forks hitting five hundred glasses. ,45000
EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945) Silence. ,25
HIGH ANGLE ON THE MALL, late day. ,964000
The GUESTS are gone. ,16400000
A single black car is in the courtyard. ,250000
FREDDIE is behind the driver's seat: the DON enters the car, looks at MICHAEL, who sits between SONNY and JOHNNY in the rear seat. ,5980
DON CORLEONE Will your girl friend get back to the city all right? ,46300000
MICHAEL Tom said he'd take care of it. ,2670000
The DON pulls the door shut; and the car pulls out, through the gate of the great Corleone Mall. ,15400
INT DAY: HOSPITAL CORRIDOR (SUMMER 1945) A long white hospital corridor, at the end of which we can see a grouping of FIVE WOMEN, some old and some young, but all plump and dressed in black. ,22000
DON CORLEONE and his SONS move toward the end. ,3210000
But then the DON slows, putting his hand on MICHAEL's shoulder. ,294000
MICHAEL stops and turns toward his FATHER. The two looks at one another for some time. ,40800
SILENCE. DON CORLEONE then lifts his hand, and slowly touches a particular medal on MICHAEL's uniform. ,11100
DON CORLEONE What was this for? ,1010000
MICHAEL For bravery. ,33
DON CORLEONE And this? ,1010000
MICHAEL For killing a man. ,7420000
DON CORLEONE What miracles you do for strangers. ,243000
MICHAEL I fought for my country. ,2230000
It was my choice. ,626000
DON CORLEONE And now, what do you choose to do? ,3040000
MICHAEL I'm going to finish school. ,42100
DON CORLEONE Good. ,1000000
When you are finished, come and talk to me. ,3990000
I have hopes for you. ,8640000
Again they regard each other without a word. ,144000
MICHAEL turns, and continues on. ,1270000
DON CORLEONE watches a moment, and then follows. ,9
INT DAY: HOSPITAL ROOM (SUMMER 1945) DON CORLEONE enters the hospital room, moving closest to OUR VIEW. He is followed by his SONS, JOHNNY and the WOMEN. DON CORLEONE (whispered) Genco, I've brought my sons to pay their respects. ,55
And look, even Johnny Fontane, all the way from Hollywood. ,89600
GENCO is a tiny, wasted skeleton of a man. ,18100
DON CORLEONE takes his bony hand, as the others arrange themselves around his bed, each clasping the other hand in turn. ,7
GENCO Godfather, Godfather, it's your daughter's wedding day, you cannot refuse me. ,8610
Cure me, you have the power. ,2
DON CORLEONE I have no such power...but Genco, don't fear death. ,12400
GENCO (with a sly wink) It's been arranged, then? ,12300
DON CORLEONE You blaspheme. ,3150
Resign yourself. ,92500
GENCO You need your old Consigliere. ,118000000
Who will replace me? (suddenly) Stay with me Godfather. ,16300000
Help me meet death. ,2300000
If he sees you, he will be frightened and leave me in peace. ,3060000
You can say a word, pull a few strings, eh? ,33700
We'll outwit that bastard as we outwitted all those others. (clutching his hand) Godfather, don't betray me. ,2320
The DON motions all the others to leave the room. ,130000
They do. ,14500000
He returns his attention to GENCO, holding his hand and whispering things we cannot hear, as they wait for death. ,18200
INT NIGHT: AIRPLANE (SUMMER 1945) FADE IN: The interior of a non-stop Constellation. ,88200
HAGEN is one of the very few passengers on this late flight. ,1540000
He looks like any young lawyer on a business trip. ,684000
He is tired from the difficult preparation and duties that he has just executed during the wedding. ,152000
On the seat next to him is an enormous, bulging briefcase. ,15700
He closes his eyes. ,246000
INT NIGHT: HONEYMOON HOTEL (SUMMER 1945) The honeymoon hotel: CARLO and CONNIE. CARLO is in his undershorts, sitting up on the bed, anxiously taking the envelopes out of the silk bridal purse and counting the contents. ,40

LUCA BRASI sitting near to him. ,9170

Find out what you can, through the Tattaglias. ,2170
Let them believe you could be tempted away from the Corleone Family, if the right offer was made. ,9
Learn what he has under his fingernails... ,52400000
INT NIGHT: MANCINI APT. HALL (SUMMER 1945) The hallway of an apartment building. ,43700
SONNY enters, climbs two steps at a time. ,18100000
He knocks, and then whispers. ,59100
SONNY It's me, Sonny. ,6030000
The door opens, and two lovely arms are around him, pulling him into the apartment. ,541000
INT NIGHT: LUCA'S ROOM (WINTER 1945) LUCA BRASI's tiny room. ,12300
He is partly dressed. ,15300000
He kneels and reaches under his bed and pulls out a small, locked trunk. ,446000
He opens it, and takes out a heavy, bullet-proof vest. ,106000
He puts it on, over his wool undershirt, and then puts on his shirt and jacket. ,61100
He takes his gun, quickly disassembles, checks, and reassembles it. ,170000
And leaves. ,6360000
INT NIGHT: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945) A CLOSE VIEW of DON CORLEONE thinking quietly. ,53000

HAGEN considers other papers. ,284000
INT NIGHT: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945) DON CORLEONE looks, and then moves HAGEN into an embrace. ,18600
He straightens his arms and looks at TOM deeply. ,63400
DON CORLEONE Remember my new Consigliere, a lawyer with his briefcase can steal more than a hundred men with guns. ,5720
EXT DAY: WOLTZ ESTATE GATE (SUMMER 1945) JACK WOLTZ ESTATE. HAGEN stands before the impressive gate, armed only with his briefcase. ,30
A GATEMAN opens the gate, and TOM enters. ,1070000
EXT DAY: WOLTZ GARDENS (SUMMER 1945) HAGEN and WOLTZ comfortably stroll along beautiful formal gardens, martinis in hand. ,30
WOLTZ You should have told me your boss was Corleone, Tom, I had to check you out. ,46100
I thought you were just some third rate hustler Johnny was running in to bluff me. (a piece of statuary) Florence, thirteenth century. ,6910
Decorated the garden of a king. ,1350000
They cross the garden and head toward the stables. ,25400
WOLTZ I'm going to show you something beautiful. ,9950000
They pass the stables, and come to rest by a stall with a huge bronze plaque attached to the outside wall: "KHARTOUM." TWO SECURITY GUARDS are positioned in chairs nearby; they rise as WOLTZ approaches. ,1930
WOLTZ You like horses? ,40100000
I like horses, I love 'em. ,73600
Beautiful, expensive Racehorses. ,13
The animal inside is truly beautiful. ,850000
WOLTZ whispers to him with true love in his voice. ,536000
WOLTZ Khartoum...Kartoum...You are looking at six hundred thousand dollars on four hoofs. ,2980
I bet even Russian Czars never paid that kind of dough for a single horse. ,9280
But I'm not going to race him I'm going to put him out to Stud. ,12100000
INT NIGHT: WOLTZ DINING ROOM (SUMMER 1945) HAGEN and WOLTZ sit at an enormous dining room table, attended by SEVERAL SERVANTS. Great paintings hang on the walls. ,6
The meal is elaborate and sumptuous. ,22
HAGEN Mr. Corleone is Johnny's Godfather. ,305000
That is very close, a very sacred religious relationship. ,28600000
WOLTZ Okay, but just tell him this is one favor I can't give. ,24500000
But he should try me again on anything else. ,1020000
HAGEN He never asks a second favor when he has been refused the first. ,1160000
WOLTZ You smooth son of a bitch, let me lay it on the line for you, and your boss. ,820000
Johnny Fontane never gets that movie. ,8320
I don't care how many Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball Goombahs come out of the woodwork! HAGEN I'm German-Irish. ,2230
WOLTZ Okay my Kraut-Mick friend, Johnny will never get that part because I hate that pinko punk and I'm going to run him out of the Movies. ,8
And I'll tell you why. ,6350000
He ruined one of Woltz Brothers' most valuable proteges. ,27
For five years I had this girl under training; singing lessons! Acting lessons! Dancing lessons! We spent hundreds of thousands of dollars--I was going to make her a star. ,34600
I'll be even more frank, just to show you that I'm not a hard-hearted man, that it wasn't all dollars and cents. ,417000
That girl was beautiful and young and innocent and she was the greatest piece of ass I've ever ad and I've had them all over the world. ,36500
Then Johnny comes along with that olive oil voice and guinea charm and she runs off. ,2610
She threw it all away to make me look ridiculous. ,3240000
A MAN IN MY POSITION CANNOT AFFORD TO BE MADE TO LOOK RIDICULOUS! EXT DAY: GENCO OLIVE OIL CO. (SUMMER 1945) An unimposing little building in New York City on Mott Street with a large old sign: "GENCO OLIVE OIL IMPORTS, INC." next to an open-faced fruit market. ,32
A dark Buick pulls up, and a single small man, whom we cannot see well because of the distance, gets out and enters the building. ,17000
This is VIRGIL SOLLOZZO. INT DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICES (SUMMER 1945) Looking toward the staircase we can hear SOLLOZZO's footsteps before he actually rises into view. ,21
He is a small man, very dark, with curly black hair. ,6660000
But wiry, and tight and hard, and obviously very dangerous. ,1660000
He is greeted at the head of the stairs by SONNY, who takes his hand and shakes it, introducing himself. ,5070
For a moment, there is a complex of handshaking quite formal, and whispered respectful introductions. ,322000
Finally, SOLLOZZO is taken into the DON's glass paneled office; the two principals are introduced. ,40400
They are very respectful of one another. ,6
Folding chairs are brought in by FREDDIE, and soon they are all sitting around in a circle; the DON, SOLLOZZO, SONNY, HAGEN, FREDDIE, CLEMENZA and TESSIO. The DON is the slightest bit foolish with all his compatriots, whereas SOLLOZZO has brought no one. ,41
Throughout all that transpires, however, it is clear that this scene is between two men: SOLLOZZO and DON CORLEONE. SOLLOZZO My business is heroin, I have poppy fields, laboratories in Narseilles and Sicily, ready to go into production. ,33
My importing methods are as safe as these things can be, about five per cent loss. ,254000
The risk is nothing, the profits enormous. ,1200000
DON CORLEONE Why do you come to me? ,39900000
Why do I deserve your generosity? ,1970000
Be my friend. ,3200000
DON CORLEONE What percentages for my family? ,145000
SOLLOZZO Thirty per cent. ,723000
In the first year your share would be four million dollars; then it would go up. ,952000
DON CORLEONE And what is the percentage of the Tattaglia family? ,24
SOLLOZZO nods toward HAGEN. SOLLOZZO My compliments. ,2720
I'll take care of them from my share. ,200000
DON CORLEONE So. I receive 30 per cent just for finance and legal protection. ,2330000
No worries about operations, is that what you tell me? ,12400000
SOLLOZZO If you think two million dollars in cash is just finance, I congratulate you Don Corleone. ,13800
There is a long silence; in which each person present feels the tension. ,94500
The DON is about to give his answer. ,5300000
DON CORLEONE I said I would see you because I've heard you're a serious man, to be treated with respect... (pause) But I'll say no to you. ,20600
We feel this around the room. ,54200000
DON CORLEONE I'll give you my reasons. ,1140000
I have many, many friends in Politics. ,185000
But they wouldn't be so friendly if my business was narcotics instead of gambling. ,57900
They think gambling is something like liquor, a harmless vice...and they think narcotics is dirty business. ,16000
SOLLOZZO takes a breath. ,8960000
DON CORLEONE No...how a man makes his living is none of my business. ,2290000
But this proposition of yours is too risky. ,13400
All the people in my family lived well the last ten years, I won't risk that out of greed. ,491000
SOLLOZZO Are you worried about security for your million? ,1160000
DON CORLEONE No. SOLLOZZO The Tattaglias will guarantee your investment also. ,10500
This startles SONNY; he blurts out. ,14300
SONNY The Tattaglia family guarantees our investment? ,810000
SOLLOZZO hears him first, and then very slowly turns to face him. ,28600
Everyone is the room knows that SONNY has stepped out of line. ,20
DON CORLEONE Young people are greedy, and they have no manners. ,35400
They speak when they should listen. ,19100000
But I have a sentimental weakness for my children, and I've spoiled them, as you see. ,170000
But Signor Sollozzo, my no is final. ,27600000
SOLLOZZO nods, understands that this is the dismissal. ,3010000
He glances one last time at SONNY. He rises; all the others do as well. ,126000
He bows to the DON, shakes his hand, and formally takes his leave. ,18900
When the footsteps can no longer be heard: The DON turns to SONNY. DON CORLEONE Santino, never let anyone outside the family know what you are thinking. ,20700
I think your brain is going soft from all that comedy you play with that young girl. ,126000
TWO OFFICE WORKERS are carrying an enormous floral display with the word "THANK YOU" spelled out in flowers. ,16800
DON CORLEONE What is this nonsense? ,3120000
HAGEN It's from Johnny. ,7980000
It was announced this morning. ,8620000
He's going to play the lead in the new Woltz Brothers film. ,1510000
INT DAY: WOLTZ'S BEDROOM (SUMMER 1945) It is large, dominated by a huge bed, in which a man, presumably WOLTZ, is sleeping. ,377
Soft light bathes the room from the large windows. ,64900
We move closer to him until we see his face, and recognize JACK WOLTZ. He turns uncomfortably; mutters, feels something strange in his bedsheets. ,51
Something wet. ,665000
He wakens, feels the sheets with displeasure; they are wet. ,9
He looks at his hand; the wetness is blood. ,1930000
He is frightened, pulls aside the covers, and sees fresh blood on his sheets and pajamas. ,23800
He grunts, pulls the puddle of blood in his bed. ,28300
He feels his own body frantically, moving, down, following the blood, until he is face to face with the great severed head of Khartoum lying at the foot of his bed. ,3960
Just blood from the hacked neck. ,1290000
White reedy tendons show. ,13700
He struggles up to his elbows in the puddle of blood to see more clearly. ,25000
Froth covers the muzzle, and the enormous eyes of the animal are yellowed and covered with blood. ,10100
WOLTZ tries to scream; but cannot. ,33800
No sound comes out. ,95900
Then, finally and suddenly an ear-splitting scream of pure terror escapes from WOLTZ, who is rocking on his hands and knees in an uncontrolled fit, blood all over him. ,6
INT DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICES (SUMMER 1945) CLOSE VIEW on the GODFATHER. Nodding. ,6060
DON CORLEONE Send Johnny my congratulations. ----------------------------------------FADE OUT-------- (SCENES 12 & 12 OMITTED) FADE IN: EXT DAY: FIFTH AVENUE (WINTER 1945) Fifth Avenue in the snow. ,4050
Christmas week. ,984000
People are bundled up with rosy faces, rushing to buy presents. ,12300
KAY and MICHAEL exit a Fifth Avenue department store, carrying a stack of gaily wrapped gifts, arm in arm. ,1560
KAY We have something for your mother, for Sonny, we have the tie for Fredo and Tom Hagen gets the Reynolds pen... ,3240
MICHAEL And what do you want for Christmas? ,65000000
KAY Just you. ,137000000
INT DAY: HOTEL ROOM (WINTER 1945) CLOSE ON a wooden radio, playing quiet Music. ,63900
THE VIEW PANS AROUND the dark hotel room, curtained against the daylight. ,88400
MICHAEL (O.S.) We'll have a quiet, civil ceremony at the City Hall, no big fuss, no family, just a couple of friends as witnesses. ,4
The two are in each other's arms in a mess of bedsheets on the two single beds that they have pushed together. ,6870
KAY What will your father say? ,30500000
MICHAEL As long as I tell him beforehand he won't object. ,7880000
He'll be hurt, but he won't object. ,2
KAY What time do they expect us? ,114000000
MICHAEL For dinner. ,20200000
Unless I call and tell them we're still in New Hampshire. ,21800000
KAY Michael. ,50300
MICHAEL Then we can have dinner, see a show, and spend one more night. ,7
He moves to the telephone. ,1380000
MICHAEL (CONT'D.) Operator. ,260000
Get me (fill in number) KAY Michael, what are you doing? ,3500000
MICHAEL Shhh, you be the long distance operator. ,3150000
KAY Hello...this is Long Distance. ,315000
I have a call from New Hampshire. ,580000
Mr. Michael Corleone. ,15300
One moment please. ,79000000
She hands the phone to MICHAEL who continues the deception. ,233000
MICHAEL Hello, Tom? ,329000
Michael. ,156000000
Yeah... listen, we haven't left yet. ,49200000
I'm driving down to the city with Kay tomorrow morning. ,6720000
There's something important I want to tell the old man before Christmas. ,25
Will he be home tomorrow night? ,63900000
INT DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICE (WINTER 1945) HAGEN in the Olive Oil Company office. ,125000
In the background, through the glass partitions, we can see the DON, at work in his office. ,298000
TOM is tired, and steeped in paperwork. ,20100
HAGEN (O.S.) Sure. ,2660000
Anything I can do for you. ,2020000
MICHAEL (O.S.) No. I guess I'll see you Christmas. ,1240000
Everyone's going to be out at Long Beach, right? ,82900000
HAGEN Right. ,7190
MICHAEL has hung up. ,1700000
He looks at the piles of work, and can't face it. ,7040000
He rises, puts on his coat and hat, and continues out. ,1420000
He peeks into the DON's office. ,19
HAGEN Michael called; he's not leaving New Hampshire until tomorrow morning. ,39700
I've got to go, I promised Theresa I'd pick up some toys for the kids. ,1290000
The DON smiles and nods. ,3560000
TOM smiles, and leaves; OUR VIEW remaining with DON CORLEONE. FREDDIE is sitting on a bench in the corner, reading the afternoon paper. ,4
He puts aside the papers the office manager has prepared for him, and then moves to FREDDIE, raps his knuckles on his head to take his nose out of the paper. ,5
DON CORLEONE Tell Paulie to get the car from the lot; I'll be ready to go home in a few minutes. ,19100
FREDO I'll have to get it myself; Paulie called in sick this morning. ,21300
DON CORLEONE That's the third time this month. ,49100000
I think maybe you'd better get a healthier bodyguard for me. ,1060000
Tell Tom. ,62700
FREDO (going) Paulie's a good kid. ,253000
If he's sick, he's sick. ,154000000
I don't mind getting the car. ,366000
FREDDIE leaves. ,2440
He slowly puts on his jacket. ,692000
Looks out his window. ,7880000
EXT DUSK: OLIVE OIL CO. (WINTER 1945) FREDDIE crosses the street. ,65000
INT DUSK: OLIVE OIL OFFICE (WINTER 1945) OFFICE MANAGER Buon Watale, Don Corleone. ,5840
The MANAGER helps him on with his overcoat. ,496000
Once again, the DON glances out his window. ,1070000
The black car pulls up; FREDDIE driving. ,3070000
DON CORLEONE Merry Christmas. (handing the MANAGER an envelope) And he starts down the stairs. ,6930
EXT DUSK: OLIVE OIL CO. (WINTER 1945) The light outside is very cold, and beginning to fail. ,78900
When FREDDIE sees his FATHER coming, he moves back into the driver's seat. ,80900
The DON moves to the car, and is about to get in when he hesitates, and turns back to the long, open fruit stand near the corner. ,66800
The PROPRIETOR springs to serve him. ,18
The DON walks among the trays and baskets, and merely points to a particular piece of fruit. ,4970
As he selects, the MAN gingerly picks the pieces of fruit up and puts them into a paper bag. ,246000
The DON pays with a five dollar bill, waits for his change, and then turns back to the car. ,46300
EXT DUSK: POLKS TOY STORE (WINTER 1945) TOM HAGEN exits carrying a stack of presents, all gift wrapped. ,33
He continues past the windows. ,1070000
As he walks, someone walks right in his way. ,6
He looks up. ,5750000
It is SOLLOZZO. He takes TOM by the arm and walks along with him. ,2320000
SOLLOZZO (quietly) Don't be frightened. ,262000
I just want to talk to you. ,4030000
A car parked at the curb suddenly flings its rear door open. ,22500
SOLLOZZO (urgently) Get in; I want to talk to you. ,49400000
HAGEN pulls his arm free. ,25900000
He is frightened. ,21400000
HAGEN I haven't got time. ,258000
TWO MEN suddenly appear on either side of him. ,2410000
SOLLOZZO Get in the car. ,176000
If I wanted to kill you you'd be dead already. ,14300000
HAGEN, sick to his stomach, moves with his ESCORTS, leaving our VIEW on the Mechanical windows gaily bobbing the story of Hansel and Gretel. ,79
We HEAR the car doors shut, and the car drive off. ,2440000
EXT NIGHT: RADIO CITY - PHONE BOOTH (WINTER 1945) RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL during the Christmas show. ,215000
KAY and MICHAEL exit; tears are still streaming down her cheeks, and she sniffles, and dries her tears with Kleenex. ,1630
KAY nostalgically hums "The Bells of Saint Mary's," as they walk arm in arm. ,153000
KAY Would you like me better if I were a nun? ,40300000
MICHAEL No. KAY Would you like me better if I were Ingrid Bergman? ,129000
They have passed a little enclosed newsstand. ,20100000
KAY sees something that terrifies her. ,24
She doesn't know what to do. ,16300000
MICHAEL still walks, thinking about her question. ,7
KAY (a little voice) Michael? ,160000
MICHAEL I'm thinking about it. ,3740000
KAY Michael... ,50200
MICHAEL No, I would not like you better if you were Ingrid Bergman. ,325000
She cannot answer him. ,216000
Rather she pulls him by the arm, back to the newsstand, and points. ,595000
His face goes grave. ,11000000
The headlines read: "VITO CORLEONE SHOT, CHIEFTAN GUNNED DOWN." MICHAEL is petrified; quickly he takes each edition, drops a dollar in the tray, and hungrily reads through them. ,5
KAY knows to remain silent. ,75600
MICHAEL (desperately) They don't say if he's dead or alive. ,13400000
EXT DUSK: OLIVE OIL CO. (WINTER 1945) DON CORLEONE by the fruit stand; he is about to move to the car, when TWO MEN step from the corner. ,1920
Suddenly, the DON drops the bag of fruit and darts with startling quickness toward the parked car. ,676000
DON CORLEONE Fredo, Fredo! The paper bag has hit the ground, and the fruit begins rolling along the sidewalk, as we HEAR gunshots. ,6160
Five bullets catch the DON in the back; he arches in pain, and continues toward the car. ,76600
The PROPRIETOR of the fruit stand rushes for cover, knocking over an entire case of fruit. ,99200
The TWO GUNMEN move in quickly, anxious to finish him off. ,5
Their feet careful to avoid the rolling fruit. ,81000
There are more GUNSHOTS. FREDDIE is hysterical; he tries to get out of the car; having difficulty opening the door. ,51600
He rushes out, a gun trembling in his hand; his mouth open. ,64400
He actually drops the gun. ,2860000
The gun falls amid the rolling fruit. ,12
The GUNMEN are panicked. ,14700
They fire once more at the downed DON CORLEONE. His leg and arm twitch where they are hit; and pools of blood are beginning to form. ,1940
The GUNMEN are obviously in a state of panic and confusion; they disappear around the corner as quickly as they came. ,7740
The PEOPLE about the avenue have all but disappeared: rather, we catch glimpses of them, poking their heads safely from around corners, inside doorways and arches, and from windows. ,10900
But the street itself is now empty. ,160000
FREDDIE is in shock; he looks at his FATHER; now great puddles of blood have formed, and the DON is lifeless and face down in them. ,12200
FREDDIE falls back on to the curb and sits there, saying something we cannot understand. ,33400
He begins to weep profusely. ,324000
INT NIGHT: SUBWAY (WINTER 1945) LUCA BRASI riding alone on a subway car, late at night. ,1580
He gets off. ,20900000
He emerges at a subway terminal, proceeds out. ,2400
EXT NITE: NIGHT CLUB STREET (WINTER 1945) LUCA walks down the late night street. ,64600
He approaches an elegant New York Nightclub, whose gaudy neon sign is still winking this late at night. ,245000
He waits and watches. ,442000
Then the sign goes out; and he proceeds into the club. ,415000
INT NITE: NIGHTCLUB (WINTER 1945) The main floor of the Nightclub is very large, with endless glistening wooden floors. ,23500
Now, at this late time, the chairs have been stacked on the tables and a NEGRO JANITOR is waxing them. ,12400
A single HAT-CHECK GIRL is counting her receipts. ,228000
LUCA moves past the empty bandstand, and sits at the bar. ,50800
ANOTHER MAN, dark and very well-built, moves behind the bar. ,1
MAN Luca...I'm Bruno Tattaglia. ,192000
LUCA I know. ,18400000
LUCA looks up; and out of the shadows emerges SOLLOZZO. SOLLOZZO Do you know who I am? ,1
LUCA Nods. ,400
SOLLOZZO You've been talking to the Tattaglias. ,2580000
They thought we could do business. ,89700000
LUCA listens. ,450
SOLLOZZO I need somebody strong to protect my operation, physically. ,41600
I've heard you're not happy with your family, you might make a switch. ,3230000
LUCA If the money is good enough. ,27700
SOLLOZZO On the first shipment, I can guarantee you fifty thousand dollars. ,124000
SOLLOZZO extends his hand, but LUCA pretends not to see it, rather, he busies himself putting a cigarette in his mouth. ,10400
BRUNO TATTAGLIA, behind the bar, makes a cigarette lighter magically appear, and holds it to LUCA's cigarette. ,42300
Then, he does an odd thing; he drops the lighter on the bar, and puts his hand lightly on LUCA's, almost patting it. ,2710
INT NITE: SONNY'S LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945) The telephone in SONNY's house is ringing. ,31400
He approaches it, obviously fresh from a nap. ,1430000
SONNY Yeah. ,3110
VOICE (O.S.) Do you recognize my voice? ,5230000
SONNY I think so. ,13800000
Detective squad? ,34400
VOICE (O.S.) Right. ,16000000
Don't say my name, just listen. ,15100000
Somebody shot your father outside his place fifteen minutes ago. ,145000
SONNY Is he alive? ,2580000
VOICE (O.S.) I think so, but I can't get close enough. ,105000000
There's a lot of blood. ,1120000
I'll try to find out more. ,211000
SONNY Find out anything you can...you got a Grand coming. (click) SONNY cradles the phone. ,2150000
An incredible rage builds up in him, his face actually turning red. ,59700
He would like to rip the phone to pieces in his bare hands. ,19200000
Then he controls it. ,165000
Quickly, he dials another number. ,415000
SONNY Theresa, let me talk to Tom. ,14800000
Not yet? ,14100000
Have him call me as soon as he gets home. ,2430000
He hangs up. ,73000
SANDRA (O.S.) Sonny? ,1
Sonny, who is it? (she enters the room) What is it? ,1890000
SONNY (calmly) They shot the old man. ,16700000
SANDRA Oh God... ,3000000
SONNY Honey...don't worry. ,226000
Nothing else is going to happen. ,7520000
There is a POUNDING on the door. ,40700000
A BABY starts crying. ,4720000
SANDRA (really frightened) SONNY? SONNY reaches into a cabinet drawer, takes out a gun, and moves quickly. ,20700
He opens the front door quickly. ,82400
It is CLEMENZA. He enters, SONNY closes the door. ,75700
SANDRA goes to look after the baby. ,1680000
CLEMENZA (excited) You heard about your father? ,1460000
SONNY Yeah. ,3200
CLEMENZA The word is out in the streets that he's dead. ,355000
SONNY Where the hell was Paulie, why wasn't he with the Don? ,2190000
CLEMENZA Paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home. ,53100
SONNY How many times did he stay home the last couple of months? ,3670000
CLEMENZA Maybe three, four times. ,5890
I always asked Freddie if he wanted another bodyguard, but he said no. ,2
Things have been so smooth the last ten years... ,8950000
SONNY Go get Paulie, I don't care how sick he is. ,129000
Pick him up yourself, and bring him to my father's house. ,645000
CLEMENZA That's all? ,296000
Don't you want me to send some people over here? ,68600
SONNY No, just you and Paulie. ,2470000
CLEMENZA leaves; SONNY moves to SANDRA, who sits on the couch weeping quietly, comforting her BABY. SONNY A couple of our people will come to stay here. ,7690
Do whatever they say; I'm going over to the main house. ,45700000
If you want me, use Pop's special phone. ,40100000
The telephone rings again. ,97200
SONNY answers it. ,35
SONNY Hello. ,2390
SOLLOZZO (O.S.) Santino Corleone? ,26900
SANDRA moves behind him, anxious to know who it is. ,442000
SONNY indicates that she be quiet. ,20900
SONNY Yeah. ,7090
SOLLOZZO (O.S.) We have Tom Hagen. ,64700
In about three hours he'll be released with our proposition. ,1820000
Don't do anything until you've heard what he has to say. ,1350000
You can only cause a lot of trouble. ,4520000
What's done is done. (a pause) Don't lose that famous temper of yours. ,95300
SONNY (quietly) I'll wait. ,325000
EXT NITE: MALL (WINTER 1945) FULL VIEW OF THE CORLEONE MALL. It is night, but the courtyard is bathed with white light from floodlights on the tops of all the houses. ,97
It is very cold. ,16300000
We see the figure of SONNY cross the Mall, and let himself into the main house. ,44600
Then he calls out. ,214000
SONNY Ma? Ma, where are you. ,575000
The kitchen door swings open. ,949000
He is deliberately calm. ,9
SONNY Ma, I just got a call. ,4170000
Pop's hurt...I don't know how bad. ,101000000
MAMA (quietly) Santino? ,156000
Have they killed him? ,15
SONNY (almost in tears) We don't know yet, Ma. MAMA I'll get dressed. ,706000
In case we can see him... ,83600000
She moves out of the kitchen, and continues upstairs. ,169000
SONNY turns the gas from the pan of peppers she was frying. ,61300
He takes some bread without thinking, and dips it in the oil, and sloppily eats some of the peppers, as he moves into his father's office. ,3770
INT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945) He switches the lights on in the DON's office. ,1170000
The massive desk dominates the room. ,105000
SONNY moves quickly to the telephone, pulling a small chair to the side of the desk, and dials a number. ,16700
I want fifty reliable men out here. ,191000
TESSIO (O.S.) I heard, Sonny...but what about Clemenza's regime? ,6250
SONNY I don't want to use Clemenza's people right now. ,967000
He hangs up. ,85400
He moves quickly to a wall safe; operates the dial, and removes a small notebook. ,13400
He takes it back to the desk, and runs over the list of numbers with his forefinger. ,3200000
We follow the names, until the finger stops at one: LUCA BRASI. SONNY dials the number. ,36700
There is no answer. ,842000
SONNY Luca. ,2640
INT NITE: BUILDING (WINTER 1945) The interior of an abandoned building. ,89400
SEVERAL MEN in suits and ties sit around in the booths. ,113000
HAGEN sits in one: SOLLOZZO sits across from him. ,88500
SOLLOZZO I know you're not in the muscle end of the family--so I don't want you to be afraid. ,1
I want you to help the Corleones and I want you to help me. ,121000000
HAGEN's hands are trembling as he tries to put a cigarette in his mouth. ,64100
ONE of the BUTTON MEN brings a bottle of rye to the table, and pours a little into a delicate, flowered china cup. ,4160
SOLLOZZO Your boss is dead... ,120000
SOLLOZZO pauses respectfully. ,1990000
SOLLOZZO (pushing the bottle) Have some more. ,1150000
We got him outside his office, just before I picked you up. ,1330000
You have to make the peace between me and Santino. ,45900000
HAGEN still is focused on the grief of losing the old man. ,316000
SOLLOZZO Sonny was hot for my deal, right? ,476000
You know it's the smart thing to do, too. ,87400000
I want you to talk Sonny into it. ,8270000
HAGEN (pulling himself together) Sonny will come after you with everything he's got. ,31300
SOLLOZZO rises, impatiently. ,1990
SOLLOZZO That's going to be his first reaction. ,51400000
You have to talk some sense into him. ,55000000
The Tattaglia family stands behind me with all their people. ,3100000
The other New York Families will go along with anything that prevents a full scale war. ,404000
He leans close to HAGEN. SOLLOZZO The Don was slipping; in the old days I could never have gotten to him. ,106000
Now he's dead, nothing can bring him back. ,355000
Talk to Sonny, talk to the Caporegimes, Clemenza and Tessio...it's good business. ,10100
HAGEN Even Sonny won't be able to call off Luca Brasi. ,6500
SOLLOZZO I'll worry about Luca. ,104000
You take care of Sonny and the other two kids. ,51100000
HAGEN I'll try...It's what the Don would want us to do. ,1
SOLLOZZO (lifting his hands in an expression of harmlessness) Good...then you can go... (he escorts him to the door) I don't like violence. ,564
I'm a businessman, and blood is a big expense. ,760000
He opens the door; they step out together. ,1830000
EXT NITE: BUILDING HAGEN, SOLLOZZO exit. ,13000
But a car pulls up, and ONE of SOLLOZZO'S MEN rushes out. ,1370000
He indicates with some urgency that he wants to talk to SOLLOZZO in private. ,2
Then SOLLOZZO moves with a grave expression. ,1360000
He opens the door, indicating that HAGEN should be led back in. ,328000
SOLLOZZO The old man is still alive. ,231000
Five bullets in his Sicilian hide and he's still alive. (he gives a fatalistic shrug) Bad luck for me, bad luck for you. ,3800
EXT NITE: MALL (WINTER 1945) MICHAEL driving during the night. ,211000
There is a little fog in the air, and moisture has formed on the windshield, making it difficult to see well. ,29300
The wipers move across the view, as the gate of the Corleone Mall appears before us, still decorated for Christmas. ,1
The courtyard is bathed with white floodlight, giving this place a cold and isolated look. ,12200
The narrow entrance mouth of the Mall is sealed off with a link chain. ,2030
There are strange cars parked along the curving cement walk. ,126000
SEVERAL MEN are congregated about the gate and chain; ONE of them approaches MICHAEL's car. ,71600
MAN Who're you? ,2720000
ANOTHER peeks his ugly face almost right up to MICHAEL, and then turns. ,512000
MAN 2 It's the Don's kid; take the car, I'll bring him inside. ,535000
The FIRST MAN opens the car door, and MICHAEL steps out. ,2230000
INT NITE: HALL (WINTER 1945) The Hallway of the main house is filled with MEN MICHAEL doesn't recognize. ,20200
They pay little attention to him. ,151000
Most of them are waiting; sitting uncomfortably; no one is talking. ,1050000
INT NITE: DON'S LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945) MICHAEL moves into the living room; there is a Christmas tree, and countless greeting cards taped to the walls. ,30900
THERESA HAGEN is sitting stiffly on the sofa, smoking a cigarette; on the coffee table in front of her is a water glass half filled with whiskey. ,1
On the other side of the sofa sits CLEMENZA; his face is impassive, but he is sweating, and the cigar in his hand glistens slickly black with his saliva. ,61
PAULIE GATTO sits tensely and alone on the other side of the room. ,1
CLEMENZA sees MICHAEL, looks up at him. ,1550000
CLEMENZA Your mother's at the hospital with the old man: He's gonna pull through. ,753000
MICHAEL nods his relief. ,651000
MICHAEL Thanks. ,181000
He moves to THERESA. MICHAEL (gently) You heard from Tom yet? ,72900
Without looking up, she clings to him for a moment, and trembles. ,6770000
Occasionally, STRANGE MEN will cross through the room; everyone speaks in a whisper. ,44600
MICHAEL (taking her hand) C'mon. ,967000
He leads her into his father's office without knocking. ,410000
INT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945) SONNY and TESSIO are huddled around a yellow pad. ,1
They look up, startled. ,73300000
SONNY Don't worry, Theresa; they just want to give Tom the proposition, then they're going to turn him loose. ,22000
He reassuringly hugs THERESA, and then to MICHAEL's surprise, he kisses him on the cheek. ,23600
SONNY I was worried when we couldn't get in touch with you in that hick town. ,32000
MICHAEL How's Mom? ,72700000
SONNY Good. ,10600
She's been through it before. ,45000
You were too young to know about it. ,1
You better wait outside; there're some things you shouldn't hear. ,61300000
MICHAEL I can help you out... ,3
SONNY Oh no you can't, the old man'd be sore as hell if I let you get mixed up in this. ,245000
MICHAEL Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny. ,2890000
SONNY Theresa. ,1270
She understands, and leaves them alone. ,3030000
SONNY All right, Mikey...who do we have to hit, Clemenza or Paulie? ,4500
MICHAEL What? ,177000
SONNY One of them fingered the old man. ,48100
MICHAEL didn't realize that the men waiting outside were on trial for their lives. ,59000
MICHAEL Clemenza? ,1170
No, I don't believe it. ,1470000
SONNY You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay. ,1880000
It was Paulie. ,2350
MICHAEL How can you be sure? ,2
SONNY On the three days Paulie was sick this month, he got calls from a payphone across from the old man's building. ,2820
We got people in the phone company. (he shrugs) Thank God it was Paulie...we'll need Clemenza bad. ,5510
MICHAEL is just realizing the gravity and extent of the situation. ,121000
MICHAEL Is it going to be all-out war, like last time? ,829000
SONNY Until the old man tells me different. ,2170000
MICHAEL Then wait, Sonny. ,109000
Talk to Pop. ,29
SONNY Sollozzo is a dead man, I don't care what it costs. ,123000
I don't care if we have to fight all the five families in New York. ,9
The Tattaglia family's going to eat dirt. ,48200000
I don't care if we all go down together. ,64000000
MICHAEL (softly) That's not how Pop would have played it. ,12000000
SONNY I know I'm not the man he was. ,93300000
But I'll tell you this and he'll tell you too. ,1
When it comes to real action, I can operate as good as anybody short range. ,2300000
MICHAEL (calmly) All right, Sonny. ,40700
SONNY Christ, if I could only contact Luca. ,4830000
MICHAEL Is it like they say? ,45900000
Is he that good? ,11600000
Outside, we HEAR THERESA cry out, almost a scream of relief. ,5970000
Then open the door and rush out. ,317000
Everyone is standing: in the doorway, TOM HAGEN is wrapped in a tight embrace with his WIFE. HAGEN If I plead before the Supreme Court, I'll never do better than I did tonight with that Turk. ,184
EXT NITE: MALL, FEATURING DON'S HOUSE (WINTER 1945) The windows of the main house are dark except for the DON's study. ,71300
It stands out against the cold, dark night. ,505000
INT NITE: DON'S LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945) The living room is empty, save for PAULIE GATTO sitting on the edge of the sofa. ,46
The clock reads: 4:00 a.m. ,261000
INT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945) SONNY, MICHAEL, HAGEN, CLEMENZA and TESSIO; all exhausted, in shirtsleeves, about to fall asleep. ,270
It is four in the morning; there is evidence of many cups of coffee and many snacks. ,125000
They can barely talk anymore. ,4910000
HAGEN Is the hospital covered? ,380000
SONNY The cops have it locked in and I got my people there visiting Pop all the time. ,353000
What about the hit list. ,221000
HAGEN widens his sleepy eyes, and looks at the yellow pad. ,11900
HAGEN Too much, too far, too personal. ,2170000
The Don would consider this all purely a business dispute: Get rid of Sollozzo, and everything falls in line. ,29800
YOU don't have to go after the Tattaglias. ,71700000
HAGEN What about Luca? ,7500000
Sollozzo didn't seem worried about Luca. ,106000
That worries me. ,98600
SONNY If Luca sold out we're in real trouble. ,373000
HAGEN Has anyone been able to get in touch with him? ,911000
SONNY No, and I've been calling all night. ,620000
Maybe he's shacked up. ,66500000
HAGEN Luca never sleeps over with a broad. ,44500
He always goes home when he's through. ,3830000
Mike, keep ringing Luca's number. ,504000
MICHAEL, very tired, picks up the phone, and dials the number once again. ,458000
He can hear the phone ringing on the other end but no one answers. ,322000
Then hangs up. ,74400
HAGEN Keep trying every fifteen minutes. (exhausted) SONNY Tom, you're the Consigliere, what do we do if the old man dies? ,606
HAGEN Without your father's political contacts and personal influence, the Corleone family loses half its strength. ,14200
The old days are over, this is 1946; nobody wants bloodshed anymore. ,73400
If your father dies...make the deal, Sonny. ,531000
SONNY (angry) That's easy to say; it's not your father. ,24800000
HAGEN (quietly) I was as good a son to him as you or Mike. ,53600000
SONNY Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it that way. ,349000
HAGEN We're all tired... ,2790000
SONNY OK, we sit tight until the old man can give us the lead. ,50400
But Tom, I want you to stay inside the Mall. ,7
You too, Mike, no chances. ,100000000
Tessio, you hold your people in reserve, but have them nosing around the city. ,1220000
The hospital is yours; I want it tight, fool-proof, 24 hours a day. ,94400
There is a timid knock on the door. ,2850000
SONNY What is it? ,3570
PAULIE GATTO looks in. ,2010000
CLEMENZA I tol' you to stay put, Paulie... ,2
PAULIE The guy at the gate's outside...says there's a package... ,1710000
SONNY Tessio, see what it is. ,1
TESSIO gets up, leaves. ,754000
PAULIE You want me to hang around? ,2
SONNY Yeah. ,3830
Hang around. ,908000
PAULIE Outside? ,889
CLEMENZA Outside. ,15
PAULIE Sure. ,4840
He closes the door. ,51200
SONNY Clemenza. ,1410
You take care of Paulie. ,5
I don't ever want to see him again. ,30100000
CLEMENZA Understood. ,28
SONNY Okay, now you can move your men into the Mall, replace Tessio's people. ,2320000
Mike, tomorrow you take a couple of Clemenza's people and go to Luca's apartment and wait for him to show. ,1
That crazy bastard might be going after Sollozzo right now if he's heard the news. ,9
SONNY OK forget it, just stay on the phone. ,1
MICHAEL is embarrassed to be so protected. ,65500
He dials Luca Brasi's number once again. ,1
CLEMENZA A Sicilian message: Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes. ,1
BRUNO TATTAGLIA had just patted his hand. ,1
LUCA looks up at him. ,4
Then SOLLOZZO pats the other hand, almost affectionately. ,2
LUCA is just about to twist his hands away, when they both clamp down as hard as they can. ,1
Suddenly, a garrote is thrown around his neck, and pulled violently tight. ,3
His face begins to turn to purple blotches, and then totally purple, right before our eyes; his tongue hangs out, in a far more extreme way than a normal tongue could. ,1
His eyes bulge. ,13500
ONE of the MEN looks down at him in disgust as LUCA's strength leaves him. ,1
BRUNO (making an ugly face) Oh Christ...all over the floor. ,1
SOLLOZZO lets LUCA's hand go with a victorious smile on his face. ,2
LUCA falls to the floor. ,2
ROCCO moves to the garage, which is specially heated, and in which CLEMENZA is busy at work washing a shiny brand new Lincoln. ,1
LAMPONE admires the car. ,5
LAMPONE Nice. ,11
CLEMENZA Crazy Detroit delivered it with a wooden bumper. ,2
CLEMENZA Today you make your bones on Paulie. ,1
You understand everything? ,148000
LAMPONE Sure. ,2
Accurate up to five feet. ,13
LAMPONE expertly puts the gun away. ,2
The two men walk to the car. ,1
He's running scared. ,221000
He's already thinking of going to the mattresses. ,11
Paulie, you know a good location? ,1
PAULIE relaxes a bit; he thinks he's off any possible hook he was on. ,11300
Also there's the money he can make by selling Sollozzo any secret location. ,1
PAULIE I'll think about it. ,3
CLEMENZA (grunting) Drive while you thinking; I wanna get to the City this month! The car pulls out. ,1
EXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR - ON ROAD (WINTER 1945) Inside PAULIE drives; and CLEMENZA sits in a grump. ,2
OUR VIEW does not show LAMPONE in the rear seat. ,1
EXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR AT TUNNEL (WINTER 1945) The Car crosses to the Midtown Tunnel in the late Winter light. ,1
CLEMENZA Pay attention! EXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR AT MATTRESS (WINTER 1945) The car is parked in the City. ,1
PAULIE comes down from an available apartment and gets back into the car. ,2
PAULIE Good for ten men... ,1
CLEMENZA OK, go to Arthur Avenue; I'm suppose to call when I found somethin'. ,3
The car pulls off. ,31
EXT DAY: RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945) New part of the city; the car pulls up in a parking lot. ,1
He walks, tucking his shirt into his pants, around the corner and enters the Luna Restaurant. ,1
INT DAY: RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945) CLEMENZA enters the little restaurant, sits down at a table. ,3
The WAITERS know him; immediately put a bottle of wine, some bread--and then a plate of veal on his table. ,2
He eats. ,787000
EXT DAY: RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945) CLEMENZA exits the restaurant, belches, adjusts his pants; he is well fed. ,1
We move with him around the corner, not knowing what to expect has happened to Paulie. ,1
There is the car; PAULIE is still sitting behind the wheel, LAMPONE in the rear seat. ,3
CLEMENZA steps in. ,2
CLEMENZA He talked my ear off. ,2
Want us to go back to Long Beach; have another job for us. ,1
Rocco, you live in the City, can we drop you off? ,7
LAMPONE (O.S.) Ah, I left my car at your place. ,1
CLEMENZA OK, then you gotta come back. ,1
The car pulls out. ,35
PAULIE You think we'll go for that last place? ,1
CLEMENZA Maybe, or you gotta know now. ,1
PAULIE Holy cow, I don't gotta know nothing. ,1
EXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR ON CAUSEWAY (WINTER 1945) The car moves along the ready beach area of the causeway. ,2
Inside, CLEMENZA turns to PAULIE. CLEMENZA Paulie, pull over. ,1
I gotta take a leak. ,35000
The car pulls off the Causeway, into the reeds. ,54700
CLEMENZA steps out of the car, OUR VIEW MOVING with him. ,1
He turns his back three quarters from us (we can no longer see the car), unzips, and we hear the sound of urine hitting the ground. ,1
PAULIE is dead, bleeding from the mouth; the windows behind him are shattered. ,1
CLEMENZA Leave the gun. ,1840
Many strange cars are parked on the nearby streets. ,2
We can see the group of BUTTON MEN, stationed here and there, obviously sentries with concealed weapons. ,3
He wanders past them, and hesitates and looks at the yard. ,1
The basketball ring now half coming off. ,1
Then a shout. ,64600
Hey Mikey; telephone. ,2
CLEMENZA had shouted from the kitchen window. ,1
MICHAEL hurries into the house. ,2
He points to the kitchen wall phone which is hanging off the hook. ,2
CLEMENZA Some dame. ,5
MICHAEL picks it up. ,2680
MICHAEL Hello. ,18700
Kay? ,16200000
He glances at the THUGS in the kitchen. ,1
Tries to shield the phone. ,1
MICHAEL Huh? ,4970
KAY (O.S.) Tell me you love me. ,1
MICHAEL glances at the HOODS at the kitchen table. ,2
KAY (O.S.) Please say it. ,1
MICHAEL Look. ,27300
I'll see you tonight, OK? KAY (O.S.) OK. (click) CLEMENZA is getting ready to build a tomato sauce for all the button men stationed around the house. ,1
CLEMENZA How come you don't tell that nice girl you love her...here, learn something... you may have to feed fifty guys some day. ,2
You start with olive oil...fry some garlic, see. ,32
And then fry some sausage...or meat balls if you like...then you throw in the tomatoes, the tomato paste...some basil; and a little red wine...that's my trick. ,5
SONNY peeks into the kitchen; sees CLEMENZA. SONNY You take care of Paulie? ,1
CLEMENZA You won't see Paulie anymore. ,2
He's sick for good this winter. ,4300000
MICHAEL starts to leave. ,9
SONNY Where are you going? ,3380
MICHAEL To the city. ,8
SONNY (to Clemenza; dipping bread into the sauce) Send some bodyguards. ,2
MICHAEL I don't need them, Sonny. ,2
Also, I got other things. ,2
CLEMENZA Sollozzo knows Mike's a civilian. ,2
SONNY OK, but be careful. ,2
EXT NITE: CAR MICHAEL sits in the rear seat, calmly, as he is being driven into the city. ,1
THREE BUTTONMEN are crowded into the front seat. ,1
INT NITE: HOTEL LOBBY MICHAEL crosses the lobby, past lines of servicemen trying to book rooms. ,1
INT NITE: HOTEL MICHAEL and KAY eating a quiet dinner at the hotel. ,1
MICHAEL Visiting hour ends at eight thirty. ,2
I'll just sit with him; I want to show respect. ,6130000
KAY Can I go to the hospital with you? ,1
MICHAEL I don't think so. ,17
You don't want to end up on page 3 of the Daily News. ,1
KAY My parents don't read the Daily News. ,2
All right, if you think I shouldn't. ,57800000
I can't believe the things the papers are printing. ,10
KAY When will I see you again? ,5
He leans over her; kisses her. ,7
KAY When will I see you again? ,5
MICHAEL Goodbye. ,3540
KAY lies on the bed a while, and then, to herself: KAY Goodbye. ,1
MICHAEL looks. ,34200
He hesitates, looks around. ,26
This area is empty. ,14
He checks the address on a scrap of paper. ,1
It is correct. ,5550000
He walks in. ,245000
INT NITE: HOSPITAL LOBBY (WINTER 1945) MICHAEL stands in the center of an absolutely empty hospital lobby. ,1
He looks to the right; there is a long, empty corridor. ,1
To the left: the same. ,11
HIGH FULL ANGLE, as MICHAEL walks through the desolated building lit by eerie green neon lighting. ,1
He walks up to a desk marked "INFORMATION". No one is there. ,2810000
MICHAEL Hello? ,19200
Now he knows something is happening, he moves quickly, alertly. ,1
MICHAEL walking down the hospital corridors; all alone. ,3
The floors have just been mopped. ,8
They are still wet. ,332000
INT NITE: HOSPITAL STAIRS Now he turns onto a staircase; ever quickening; up several flights. ,1
INT NITE: 4TH FLOOR CORRIDOR He steps out onto the fourth floor. ,4
There are merely empty corridors. ,1
He takes out his scrap of paper; checks it. "Room 4A." Now he hurries, trying to follow the code of hospital rooms; following the right arrows, quicker and quicker they flash by him. ,1
Now he stops, looks up "4A-- Corleone". ,1
There is a special card table set up there with some magazines...and some smoking cigarettes still in the ashtray--but no detectives, no police, no bodyguards. ,1
INT NITE: DON'S ROOM 4A Slowly he pushes the door open, almost afraid at what he will find. ,160000
Lit by the moonlight through the window, he can see a FIGURE in the hospital bed alone in the room, and under a transparent oxygen tent. ,1
All that can be heard is the steady though strained breathing. ,1
Slowly MICHAEL walks up to it, and is relieved to see his FATHER, securely asleep. ,2
Tubes hang from a steel gallows beside the bed, and run to his nose and mouth. ,1
VOICE (O.S.) What are you doing here? ,1
This startles MICHAEL; who almost jumps around. ,6
It is a NURSE lit from the light behind her in the hallway. ,1
NURSE You're not supposed to be here now. ,2
MICHAEL calms himself, and moves to her. ,1
MICHAEL I'm Michael Corleone--this is my father. ,3
What happened to the detectives who were guarding him? ,2
NURSE Oh your father just had too many visitors. ,1
It interfered with the hospital service. ,12
The police came and made them all leave just ten minutes ago. (comfortingly) But don't worry. ,1
I look in on him. ,2
MICHAEL You just stand here one minute... ,52000000
I came down late. ,3440
There's no one here. ,402000
The old man is completely unprotected. ,1
I'll have some men there inside of fifteen minutes. ,5
Sit tight, and don't panic. ,2730
He hangs up; returns to the NURSE... ,2
NURSE You cannot stay here...I'm sorry. ,1
You've seen that no one's here to guard him. ,1
Now I've just gotten word that men are coming to this hospital to kill him. ,1
Believe me and help me. ,12
NURSE (frightened) We don't have to disconnect them, we can wheel the stand with the bed. ,1
INT NITE: 4TH FLOOR HOSPITAL (WINTER 1945) They roll the bed, the stand, and all the tubes silently down the corridor. ,2
We hear FOOTSTEPS coming up the stairs. ,2240
MICHAEL hears them, stops. ,1350000
MICHAEL Hurry, into there. ,4
They push it into the first available room. ,1
It is ENZO, NAZORINE's helper, carrying a bouquet of flowers. ,1
There's going to be trouble. ,138000
INT NITE: DON'S SECOND HOSPITAL ROOM (WINTER 1945) They part. ,1
MICHAEL touches his face tenderly. ,3
Shhhh, don't try to speak. ,11
The OLD MAN tries to speak...but cannot. ,2
MICHAEL tenderly puts his finger to his FATHER's lips. ,1
MICHAEL exits the hospital and moves to him. ,1
They both stand under a lamppost in the cold December night. ,1
They are both frightened; MICHAEL gives ENZO a cigarette, lights it. ,1
ENZO's hands are trembling, MICHAEL's are not. ,135000
MICHAEL Get rid of those and look like you've got a gun in your pocket. ,1
The windows of the hospital twinkle with Christmas decorations. ,1
MICHAEL Listen... ,114000
We HEAR the sound of a single automobile coming. ,1
MICHAEL and ENZO look with fear in their eyes. ,1
Then MICHAEL takes the bouquet of flowers and stuffs them under his jacket. ,3
They stand, hands in their pockets. ,1
A long low black car turns the corner and cruises by them. ,2
MICHAEL's and ENZO's faces are tough, impassive. ,450000
The car seems as though it will stop; and then quickly accelerates. ,2
MICHAEL and ENZO are relieved. ,1
MICHAEL looks down; the BAKER's hands are shaking. ,106000
He looks at his own, and they are not. ,3680000
Another moment goes by and we can hear the distant sound of police sirens. ,3
They are clearly coming toward the hospital, getting louder and louder. ,1
MICHAEL heaves a sigh of relief. ,1
TWO huge, burly POLICEMEN suddenly grab his arms while ANOTHER frisks him. ,2
A massive POLICE CAPTAIN, spattered with gold braid and scrambled eggs on his hat, with beefy red face and white hair seems furious. ,2
This is McCLUSKEY. MCCLUSKEY I thought I got all you guinea hoods locked up. ,1
Who the hell are you and what are you doing here? ,84400000
ANOTHER COP standing nearby: COP He's clean, Captain. ,1
MICHAEL studies McCLUSKEY closely. ,1
MICHAEL (quietly) What happened to the detectives who were supposed to be guarding my father? ,1
MCCLUSKEY (furious) You punk-hood. ,2
Who the hell are you to tell me my business. ,1
I pulled them off. ,99200
I don't care how many Dago gangsters kill each other. ,143000
I wouldn't lift a finger to keep your old man from getting knocked off. ,659000
Now get the hell out of here; get off this street you punk, and stay away from this hospital. ,2
MICHAEL stands quiet. ,5
MICHAEL I'll stay until you put guards around my father's room. ,3
MCCLUSKEY Phil, lock this punk up. ,2
A DETECTIVE The Kid's clean, Captain...He's a war hero, and he's never been mixed up in the rackets... ,37300
MCCLUSKEY (furious) Goddam it, I said lock him up. ,21
Put the cuffs on him. ,10800
MICHAEL (deliberately, right to McCLUSKEY's face, as he's being handcuffed) How much is the Turk paying you to set my father up, Captain? ,1
Without any warning, McCLUSKEY leans back and hits MICHAEL squarely on the jaw with all his weight and strength. ,2
MICHAEL groans, and lifts his hand to his jaw. ,3
There are more BUTTON MEN stationed more formally; and some of them visibly carrying rifles; those of the houses close to the courtyard have MEN standing by open windows. ,1
A car pulls up and out get CLEMENZA, LAMPONE, MICHAEL and HAGEN. MICHAEL's jaw is wired and bandaged. ,1
We can see MEN holding rifles. ,832000
MICHAEL Christ, Sonny really means business. ,2
They continue walking. ,6220
TESSIO joins them. ,2
The various BODYGUARDS make no acknowledgment. ,1
CLEMENZA How come all the new men? ,1
TESSIO We'll need them now. ,4
After the hospital incident, Sonny got mad. ,2
We hit Bruno Tattaglia four o'clock this morning. ,14
INT DAY: DON'S HALLWAY They enter the house past the scores of new and strange faces. ,1
INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945) SONNY is in the DON's office; he is excited and exuberant. ,3
SONNY I've got a hundred button men on the streets twenty-four hours a day. ,3
If Sollozzo shows one hair on his ass he's dead. ,3
He sees MICHAEL, and holds his bandaged face in his hand, kiddingly. ,3
SONNY Mikey, you look beautiful! MICHAEL Cut it out. ,346000
SONNY The Turk wants to talk! The nerve of that son of a bitch! After he craps out last night he wants a meet. ,3
HAGEN Was there a definite proposal? ,2
SONNY Sure, he wants us to send Mike to meet him to hear his proposition. ,2
The promise is the deal will be so good we can't refuse. ,9
HAGEN What about that Tattaglias? ,3
What will they do about Bruno? ,8
SONNY Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out what they did to my father. ,3
HAGEN We should hear what they have to say. ,2
SONNY No, no Consiglere. ,4
Not this time. ,714000
No more meetings, no more discussions, no more Sollozzo tricks. ,629
Give them one message: I WANT SOLLOZZO. If not, it's all out war. ,6
We go to the mattresses and we put all the button men out on the street. ,3
HAGEN The other families won't sit still for all out war. ,1110000
SONNY Then THEY hand me Sollozzo. ,23
HAGEN Come ON Sonny, your father wouldn't want to hear this. ,4
This is not a personal thing, this is Business. ,12
SONNY And when they shot me father... ,2
HAGEN Yes, even the shooting of your father was business, not personal... ,2
SONNY No no, no more advice on how to patch it up Tom. ,2
HAGEN bows his head; he is deeply concerned. ,2
HAGEN I found out about this Captain McCluskey who broke Mike's jaw. ,13700
He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll, and for big money. ,753
McCluskey's agreed to be the Turk's bodyguard. ,3
What you have to understand is that while Sollozzo is guarded like this, he's invulnerable. ,2
Nobody has ever gunned down a New York Police Captain. ,2670
It would be disastrous. ,131000
All the five families would come after you Sonny; the Corleone family would be outcasts; even the old man's political protection would run for cover. ,284
So just...take that into consideration. ,30
SONNY (still fuming) McCluskey can't stay with the Turk forever. ,3
We'll wait. ,25700000
MICHAEL We can't wait. ,23
No matter what Sollozzo say about a deal, he's figuring out how to kill Pop. ,3
You have to get Sollozzo now. ,2
SONNY The kid's right. ,2
HAGEN What about McCluskey? ,4
MICHAEL Let's say now that we have to kill McCluskey. ,366000
We'll clear that up through our Newspaper contacts later. ,1630000
SONNY Go on Mike. ,3
MICHAEL They want me to go to the conference with Sollozzo. ,3
Set up the meeting for two days from now. ,3
Sonny, get our informers to find out where the meeting will be held. ,4
Insist it has to be a public place: a bar or restaurant at the height of the dinner hour. ,4
So I'll feel safe. ,6
Everyone in the room is astonished; they all look at MICHAEL. Silence. ,2
SONNY suddenly breaks out in laughter. ,14000
He points a finger at MICHAEL, trying to speak. ,2
SONNY You? ,30500
You, the high-class college kid. ,7
You never wanted to get mixed up in the family business. ,9
Now you wanta gun down a police Captain and the Turk just because you got slapped in the face. ,4
You're taking it personal, it's just business and he's taking it personal. ,5
Now CLEMENZA and TESSIO are also smiling; only HAGEN keeps his face serious. ,4
MICHAEL (angrily, but cold) Sonny, it's all personal, and I learned it from him, the old man, the Godfather. ,2
He took my joining the Marines personal. ,4
I take Sollozzo trying to kill my father personal, and you know I'll kill them Sonny. ,2
MICHAEL radiates danger...SONNY stops laughing. ,4
INT DAY: CLEMENZA'S CELLAR (WINTER 1945) CLOSE on a revolver. ,2
Here. (he hands the gun to another pair of hands) Whatsamatter? ,1
Trigger too tight. (it fires: very LOUD) I left it noisy, so it'll scare any pain-in-the-neck innocent bystander away. ,1
MICHAEL is alone with CLEMENZA in a cellar workshop. ,2
CLEMENZA Just let your hand drop to your side, and let the gun slip out. ,1
Everybody will still think you got it. ,6
They'll be starin' at your face, see? ,2
Then walk out of the place real fast, but don't run. ,2
Don't look anybody directly in the eye, but don't look away from them neither. ,454000
Hey, they'll be scared stiff o you, believe me. ,2
Nobody's gonna bother with you. ,398000
Don't worry about nothing; you'd be surprised how good these things go. ,2
O.K., put your hat on, let's see how you look. ,1
Helps with identification. ,12900000
They put the hat on; CLEMENZA adjusts it. ,2
CLEMENZA Mostly it gives witnesses an excuse to change their identification when we make them see the light. ,3
Then you take a long vacation and we catch the hell. ,1
MICHAEL How bad will it be? ,3
CLEMENZA Probably all the other families will line up against us. ,2
But, it's alright. ,373000
These things have to happen once every ten years or so...gets rid of the bad blood. ,4
You gotta stop 'em at the beginning. ,8
Like they shoulda stopped Hitler at Munich, they shoulda never let him get away with that, they were just asking for big trouble... ,2
INT DAY: DON'S HALL & LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945) MICHAEL steps into the foyer of the main house. ,28600
A card table is set up with a man playing cards with three of the Corleone buttonmen. ,1
It's a mess. ,2270000
SONNY asleep on the sofa. ,1
On the coffee table are the remains of a take-out Chinese food dinner, and a half-empty bottle of whisky. ,1
The radio is playing. ,1990000
MICHAEL Why don't you stop living like a bum and get this place cleaned up. ,1
SONNY What are you, inspecting the barracks? (SONNY sits up with his head in his hands) You ready? ,11900
Did Clemenza tell you be sure to drop the gun right away? ,156000
MICHAEL A million times. ,4
SONNY Sollozzo and McCluskey are going to pick you up in an hour and a half on Times Square, under the big Camels sign. ,2
HAGEN We don't let Mike go until we have the hostage, Sonny. ,1
CLEMENZA It's okay...the hostage is outside playing pinochle with three of my men. ,1
The phone rings in the DON's office. ,1
SONNY That could be a Tattaglia informer with the meeting place. ,1
INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945) HAGEN has hurried into the Den to get the phone; the OTHERS move in. ,1
HAGEN's on the phone; he writes something down. ,1
SONNY One of Tattaglia's people? ,3
HAGEN No. Our informer in McCluskey's precinct. ,1
Tonight at 8:00 he signed out for Louis' Restaurant in the Bronx. ,1
Anyone know it. ,361000
TESSIO Sure, I do. ,3
It's perfect for us. ,1070000
A small family place with big booths where people can talk in private. ,26100000
Good food. ,13000000
Everybody minds their business. ,759
Perfect. (he moves to the desk and makes a crude drawing) This is the entrance, Mike. ,1
When you finish just walk out and turn left, then turn the corner. ,10
Clemenza, you gotta work fast to plant the gun. ,2
They got an old- fashioned toilet with a space between the water container and the wall. ,11
We can tape the gun behind there. ,2
CLEMENZA Mike, they're gonna frisk you in the car. ,1
You'll be clean so they won't worry 'bout nothing. ,1
In the restaurant, wait and talk a while, and then ask permission to go. ,4930000
See? ,41300000
Then when you come out, don't waste time; don't sit down...you come out blasting. ,1
And don't take chances. ,64100
In the head, two shots apiece. ,10
And out as fast as your legs can move. ,1
SONNY I want somebody very good, very safe to plant that gun. ,3
I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hand. ,36
CLEMENZA The gun will be there. ,6
SONNY (to MICHAEL, warmly) You're on, kid...I'll square it with Mom your not seeing her before you left. ,1
And I'll get a message to your girl friend when I think the time is right. ,4
CLEMENZA We gotta move... ,4
MICHAEL O.K. ,48300
HAGEN (starting to crack) Jesus, I don't know... ,16800000
SONNY Can you do it Mike? ,1
MICHAEL moves out. ,5640
EXT NITE: CAMELS SIGN (WINTER 1945) The enormous "CAMELS" sign, puffing smoke, below it stands MICHAEL, dressed in a warm overcoat, and wearing the hat CLEMENZA had given him. ,2
A long black car pulls around the corner and slows before him. ,4
DRIVER Get in, Mike. ,2
EXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR (WINTER 1945) Inside the car, SOLLOZZO reaches his hand over the back seat and shakes MIKE's hand. ,2
SOLLOZZO I'm glad you came, Mike. ,3
I hope we can straighten everything out. ,15
All this is terrible, it's not the way I wanted things to happen at all. ,6
It should never have happened. ,96000
MICHAEL I want to settle things tonight. ,5570000
SOLLOZZO He won't be; I swear to you be my children he won't be. ,4
Just keep an open mind when we talk. ,976000
I hope you're not a hothead like your brother, Sonny. ,28
It's impossible to talk business with him. ,6
McCLUSKEY grunts. ,6
MCCLUSKEY He's a good kid. ,5
He's all right. ,1070000
He gives MICHAEL a thorough frisk. ,2
MCCLUSKEY I'm sorry about the other night Mike. ,2
I'm getting too old for my job, too grouchy. ,2200
Can't stand the aggravation. ,28
You know how it is. ,2950000
He's clean. ,315000
EXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR - WEST SIDE HIGHWAY (WINTER 1945) MICHAEL looks at the DRIVER and then ahead to see where they're heading. ,1
The car takes the George Washington Bridge. ,1
MICHAEL is concerned. ,16300
SOLLOZZO (sly) Maybe. ,658000
MICHAEL closes his eyes. ,1250
EXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR ON G.W. ,1
BRIDGE (WINTER 1945) The car speeds along the George Washington Bridge on its way to New Jersey. ,1
Then suddenly it hits the divider, temporarily lifts into the air, and bounces over into the lanes going back to New York. ,2
It then hits it very fast, on the way back to the city. ,2
EXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR (WINTER 1945) SOLLOZZO checks to see the cars that had been following, and then leans to the DRIVER. SOLLOZZO Nice work; I'll remember it. ,1
MICHAEL is relieved. ,3400
EXT NITE: LUNA AZURA RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945) The car pulls up in front of a little family restaurant in the Bronx: The "LUNA AZURA". There is no one on the street. ,1
MICHAEL looks to see if the DRIVER is going to get out with them. ,2
He gets out, and opens the door. ,1
SOLLOZZO, McCLUSKEY and MICHAEL get out; the DRIVER remains leaning against the car. ,1
They enter the restaurant. ,40700
INT NITE: LUNA AZURA (WINTER 1945) A very small family restaurant with a mosaic tile floor. ,1
SOLLOZZO, MICHAEL and McCLUSKEY sit around a rather small round table near the center of the room. ,2
There are empty booths along the side walls; with a handful of CUSTOMERS, and ONE or TWO WAITERS. It is very quiet. ,1
MCCLUSKEY Is the Italian food good here? ,12
SOLLOZZO Try the veal; it's the finest in New York. ,5
The solitary WAITER brings a bottle of wine to the table. ,1
They watch him silently as he uncorks it and pours three glasses. ,3
Then, when he leaves, SOLLOZZO turns to McCLUSKEY: SOLLOZZO I am going to talk Italian to Mike. ,2
MCCLUSKEY Sure, you two go right ahead; I'll concentrate on my veal and my spaghetti. ,4960
SOLLOZZO now begins in rapid Sicilian. ,5
MICHAEL listening carefully and nodding every so often. ,3
Then MICHAEL answers in Sicilian, and SOLLOZZO goes on. ,3
The WAITER occasionally brings food; and they hesitate while he is there; then go on. ,3
Then MICHAEL, having difficulty expressing himself in Italian, accidentally lapses into English. ,4
MICHAEL (using English for emphasis) Most important...I want a sure guarantee that no more attempts will be made on my father's life. ,2
SOLLOZZO What guarantees can I give you? ,3
I am the hunted one. ,12600
I've missed my chance. ,651000
You think too highly of me, my friend...I am not so clever...all I want if a truce... ,1
MICHAEL looks long and hard at SOLLOZZO, who is smiling holding his open hands up as if to say: "I have no tricks up my sleeve". ,3
Then he looks away and makes a distressed look on his face. ,639000
SOLLOZZO What is it? ,4
MICHAEL Is it all right if I go to the bathroom? ,2
SOLLOZZO is intuitively suspicious. ,3
He studies MICHAEL with his dark eyes. ,6
Then he thrusts his hand onto MICHAEL's thigh feeling in and around, searching for a weapon. ,2
MCCLUSKEY I frisked him; I've frisked thousands of young punks; he's clean. ,12300
He looks at a MAN sitting at a table opposite them; indicating the bathroom with his eyes. ,1
The MAN nods, indicating no one is there. ,2
SOLLOZZO Don't take too long. ,31
MICHAEL gets up and calmly walks to the bathroom, and disappears inside. ,3
INT NITE: LUNA AZURA TOILET (WINTER 1945) MICHAEL steps into the small bathroom; he is breathing very hard. ,5
He actually uses the urinal. ,177000
Then he washes his hands with the bar of pink soap; and dries them thoroughly. ,4
Then he moves to the booth, up to the old-fashioned toilet. ,4
Slowly he reaches behind the water tank; he panics when he cannot feel the gun. ,2
We see behind the tank his hand is just a few inches from the gun...he gropes searchingly...finally coming to rest on the gun. ,2
CLOSE ON MICHAEL; the feel of it reassures him. ,2
Then he breaks it loose from the tape holding it; he takes a deep breath and shoves it under his waistband. ,3
For some unexplainable reason he hesitates once again, deliberately washes his hands and dries them. ,3
Then he goes out. ,46
INT NITE: LUNA AZURA (WINTER 1945) He hesitates by the bathroom door; and looks at his table. ,3
McCLUSKEY is eating a plate of spaghetti and veal. ,3
SOLLOZZO turns around upon hearing the door, and looks directly at MICHAEL. MICHAEL looks back. ,3
Then he smiles and continues back to the table. ,3
He sits down. ,192000
MICHAEL Now I can talk. ,5
I feel much better. ,72800000
The MAN by the far wall had been stiff with attention; now he too relaxes. ,5
SOLLOZZO leans toward MICHAEL who sits down comfortably and his hands move under the table and unbutton his jacket. ,4
SOLLOZZO begins to speak in Sicilian once again but MICHAEL's heart is pounding so hard he can barely hear him. ,8260
He pulls the trigger, and we see part of SOLLOZZO's head blown away, and a spray of fine mist of blood cover the entire area. ,4
The WAITER looks in amazement; suddenly his white jacket is sprayed and stained with blood. ,6
SOLLOZZO seems in a perpetual fall to the floor; through he seems to hang in space suspended. ,2
MICHAEL pivots, and looks: There is McCLUSKEY, frozen, the fork with a piece of veal suspended in air before his gaping mouth. ,3
MICHAEL fires; catching McCLUSKEY in his thick bulging throat. ,7
He makes a horrible, gagging, choking sound. ,4
Then coolly, and deliberately, MICHAEL fires again, fires right through McCLUSKEY's white-topped skull. ,5
The air is filled with pink mist. ,2600000
MICHAEL swings toward the MAN standing by the bathroom wall. ,2
He does not make a move, seemingly paralyzed. ,3
Now he carefully shows his hands to be empty. ,5
The WAITER steps backward through the mist of blood, an expression of horror on his face. ,2
MICHAEL looks at his two victims: SOLLOZZO still in his chair, side of his body propped up by the table. ,4
McCLUSKEY finally falls from the chair to the table. ,5
MICHAEL is wildly at a peak. ,3
He starts to move out. ,2
His hand: is frozen by his side, STILL GRIPPING THE GUN. He moves, not letting the gun go. ,3
MICHAEL's face; frozen in its expression. ,6
His hand: still holding the gun. ,26500
His hand relaxes, the gun falls to the floor with a dull thud. ,4
He walks quickly out of the restaurant, looks back. ,3
He sees a frozen tableau of the murder; as though it had been recreated in wax. ,4
ANOTHER stands nearby, listening quietly. ,1800000
A little distance away, TEN MEN sit around a crude table, quietly eating. ,3
They talk in low, relaxed voices, and there is an occasional laugh. ,2
ROCCO LAMPONE stands by a window, which has been covered with a heavy-mesh wire grating, gazing out. ,3
A large bowl of pasta is passed, and the MEN eat heartily. ,2
INT DAY: BODY IN BARBER SHOP (WINTER 1945) A MAN is covered by a sheet on the floor of a barber shop. ,2
INT DAY: MATTRESS Ten mattresses are spread out around the otherwise empty living room of an apartment. ,43200
THREE or FOUR MEN including CLEMENZA, are taking naps. ,2
An arsenal of hand guns are spread out on a card table. ,179000
The MEN at the table continue their dinner; passing and pouring the wine. ,3
Trash is thrown in 2 or 3 garbage cans kept in the apartment. ,2
INT DAY: BODY IN OFFICE (WINTER 1945) A MAN, his clothes soaked in blood, lies on the floor of an office building, dead, under an enormous portrait of Harry S. ,3
Truman. ,13200000
EXT DAY: BODY ON STOOP (WINTER 1945) ANOTHER MAN, his trousers soaked in blood, lies spanning three steps of a front stoop. ,4
INT NITE: MATTRESS (WINTER 1945) TESSIO, sits in a simple straight-backed chair, doing a crossword puzzle. ,2
A thin, boyish BUTTON MAN, writes a letter. ,2
Six or seven empty mattresses, with tossed unmade blankets. ,8080
Coffee cans beside them serve as ash trays. ,2
A MAN by the table pulls the cork on another bottle of Ruffino, and wine is poured as the MEN eat. ,2
EXT DAY: BODY IN ALLEY (WINTER 1945) A CORPSE is half out of an overturned garbage can in a quiet alley. ,3
INT DAY: BODY AT TABLE (WINTER 1945) A MAN in a formal jacket and tie is slumped over a table, in a pool of blood on the tablecloth. ,3
INT DAY: MATTRESS (WINTER 1945) A neatly stacked pile of newspapers in the corner of an apartment. ,2
We catch a glimpse of one headline: "Five Family War..." The table. ,2
The MEN are sitting around cracking nuts. ,2
ONE has fallen asleep on his arms at the table. ,1
SEVERAL MEN are taking naps on the Mattresses. ,3
The PIANO PLAYER finishes the tune with finesse. ,2
Picks up and takes a drag from his cigarette. ,1
The OTHER MAN nods appreciatively. ,2
MAN Nice Augie...nice. ,2
EXT DAY: MANCINI BLDG. (SPRING '46) Several cars are parked in front of a pleasant New York apartment building. ,1440
We recognize a couple of SONNY's bodyguards loafing by the cars, pitching playing cards against the curb. ,2
Inside the building, two others wait quietly by the rows of brass mailboxes: they have been there quite awhile. ,2
Up one flight of stairs, a single man sits on the step, smoking a cigarette. ,2
One of the men by the mailboxes checks his pocketwatch, which is attached to a key chain. ,2
We HEAR the sound of a door opening; they look up. ,36700000
The man sitting on the stop stands; and looks. ,348000
SONNY backs out of an apartment, the arms of LUCY MANCINI wrapped around him. ,3
She doesn't want to let go of him; she draws him back into the apartment for a moment, and then he comes out alone, adjusting his clothes. ,146000
He jauntily skips down the steps, trailed by the bodyguard on the first floor, and moves outside toward his car. ,2
The men quickly take up their positions. ,2
As he gets in his car: DRIVER Pick up your sister? ,4
SONNY Yeah. ,3940
The car drives off; accompanied and escorted by the bodyguards in their cars. ,3
INT DAY: CONNIE'S HALL (SPRING '46) He knocks on the door. ,628000
Then again. ,1900000
CONNIE'S VOICE Who is it? ,2
SONNY It's me, Sonny. ,15
We hear the bolt slide back, and see the door open. ,5
SONNY enters, but CONNIE has quickly moved into the hallway, her back to him. ,3
SONNY (tenderly) Connie, what is it? ,3
He turns her around in his arms. ,2
Her face is swollen and bruised; and we can tell from her rough, red eyes that she has been crying for a long time. ,3
As soon as he realizes what's happened, his face goes red with rage. ,2
She sees it coming, and clings to him, preventing him from running out of the apartment. ,3
CONNIE (desperately) It was my fault! I started a fight with him and I tried to hit him so he hit me. ,2
He didn't even try to hit me hard Sonny, I walked into it. ,59200
Sonny listens, and calms himself. ,5
He touches her shoulder, the thin silk robe. ,4
SONNY I'm goin' to have the doctor come over and take a look at you. ,2
He starts to leave. ,41
CONNIE Oh Sonny, please don't do anything. ,2
Please don't. ,7790000
He stops, and then laughs good naturedly. ,5720000
SONNY Hey. ,3210
Con. ,77700000
What'm I goin' to do? ,623
Make your kid a orphan before he's born. ,2
She laughs with him. ,23
He kisses her reassuringly, and leaves. ,1
EXT DAY: CONNIE'S STREET CARLO settles down on the front steps of the 112th St. "Book" with SALLY RAGS and COACH, who have been drinking beer out of glasses and a pitcher of beer from around the corner. ,2
The ball game is blaring from the radio; and the kids on the street are still playing stickball. ,2
CARLO has barely settled down, when the kids in the street suddenly scatter, and a car comes screeching up the block and to a halt in front of the candy store. ,2
The tires scream, and before it seems as though it has even stopped, a MAN comes hurtling out of the driver's seat, moving so fast the everyone is paralyzed. ,2
He pulls CARLO away from the others, trying to get him down into the street. ,3
His shirt is ripped away in SONNY's hand. ,3
SALLY RAGS and COACH, merely sit, watching, stunned. ,4
SONNY is pounding the cowered CARLO with all his strength, in a continuous monologue of indistinguishable cursing. ,3
His blows are powerful; and begin to draw blood. ,1670000
The kids who have been playing stickball, move up, watching in fascination. ,430000
CARLO's hands are clenched tight around the railing. ,3
SONNY beats him mercilessly. ,6
Now SONNY's bodyguards' car pulls up, and they too become spectators. ,18700
SONNY's tight fists are going down like hammers, into CARLO's face and body. ,4
CARLO's nose is bleeding profusely; but still he does nothing, other than hang onto the railing. ,3
SONNY grabs hold of CARLO's massive body, and tries to drag him off of the hold on the railing, his teeth clenched in the effort. ,3920
Then he tries loosening CARLO's locked hands; even biting them. ,3
CARLO screams but he does not let go. ,4
It's clear that CARLO is much stronger than he is, and will not be moved. ,5
SONNY knees him in the mouth, and beats him more; but he is exhausted. ,3
Totally out of breath, he stammers haltingly to the bleeding CARLO. SONNY You...bastard...You...hurt my sister... again...and I'll kill...you. ,3
He wipes the sweat from his face, and then turns suddenly. and hurries back to the car, in a moment his car is gone, leaving even his bodyguards in confusion. ,3
We notice ONE MAN with a sports jacket in the group of spectators especially interested. ,3
CARLO finally relaxes the clenched, locked hands. ,54300
He slumps onto the stoop. ---------------------------------------FADE OUT--------- FADE IN: EXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946) HIGH ANGLE on the Corleone Mall. ,2
It is a gray, rainy day. ,9
Young BUTTON MEN in raincoats stand in quiet groups of various points around the main house and compound. ,3
Things have changed; one house has been extensively enlarged; a new and secure gate house has been built. ,4
Security measures that had been make-shift and temporarily have now been made a permanent part of the Mall, evolving it into a Medieval Fortress. ,3
We notice a huge crater in the courtyard; the result of a recent bomb attempt. ,223000
The house nearest the crater is damaged by fire. ,3
A taxi arrives; KAY ADAMS steps out, huddled in a bright yellow raincoat; she lets the cab go, and hurries to the shelter of the gate house. ,2
They are not expecting her, and ask her to wait while they call the main house. ,3
KAY looks at the imposing, depressing Mall, while rain still runs down onto her face. ,3
She notices the bomb crater, and the fire damage; and the sullen faces of the BUTTON MEN. TOM HAGEN exits the Main House, and hurries toward her. ,3
HAGEN Kay, we weren't expecting you. ,5
You should call... ,749000
KAY I've tried calling and writing. ,1290000
I want to reach Michael. ,10
HAGEN Nobody knows where he is. ,10
KAY looks in the direction of the crater, filling with rainwater. ,3
KAY What was that? ,3720
HAGEN An accident. ,4
No one was hurt. ,442000
KAY Listen Tom, I let my cab go; can I come in to call another one? ,3
TOM is clearly reluctant to involve her any more than he has to. ,3
HAGEN Sure...I'm sorry. ,3
They hurry through the rain and into the Main House. ,3
INT DAY: DON'S LIVING ROOM (SPRING 1946) In the living room, KAY shakes the water from her coat and takes her rainhat off. ,6
KAY Will you give this to him. ,4
HAGEN If I accept that letter and you told a Court of Law I accepted it, they would interpret it as my having knowledge of his whereabouts. ,4
Just wait Kay, he'll contact you. ,4
We hear footsteps descending the staircase; MAMA CORLEONE enters the room; the OLD WOMAN squints at KAY, evaluating her. ,4
MAMA You're Mikey's little girl. ,3
KAY nods yes; there are still tears in her eyes. ,4
KAY shakes her head. ,371
MAMA (to HAGEN) Disgrazia, you don't even give the poor girl a cup of coffee? ,3
HAGEN shrugs helplessly; on an impulse, KAY quickly moves toward MAMA, the letter extended. ,3
KAY Will you give this letter to Michael. ,4
HAGEN Mama, no. ,3
MAMA You tell me what to do? ,1
She takes the letter from KAY, who is grateful and relieved. ,4
KAY Why did they blame Michael? ,3
MAMA You listen to me, you go home to your family, and you find a good young man and get married. ,3
Forget about Mikey; he's no good for you, anymore. ,4
She looks directly into KAY's eyes; and KAY understands what that means. ,4
EXT DAY: DON'S HOSPITAL (SPRING 1946) A hospital in New York City. ,3
POLICE and teams of PRIVATE DETECTIVES are stationed guarding the area. ,3
HAGEN walks with the stretcher, and for a moment they disappear behind the ambulance. ,3
Then suddenly, siren blasting, it speeds off, accompanied by dark low-slung cars. ,3
EXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946) The Corleone Mall. ,2
Equally impressive security stands ready at the Corleone Mall. ,3
EXTRA BUTTON MEN, as well as SOME POLICE, and PRIVATE DETECTIVES. It all seems to be under the supervision of ROCCO LAMPONE. All is silent. ,6840
The WOMEN and CHILDREN, dressed in Sunday clothes, wait. ,3
INT DAY: DON'S HALL (SPRING 1946) Inside the Main CORLEONE House: Hospital ORDERLIES carry the DON on his stretcher carefully under the watchful eyes of CLEMENZA, TESSIO, LAMPONE and various GUARDS and BUTTON MEN. All the CORLEONE family is here today: MAMA, FREDO, SANDRA, THERESA, CONNIE, CARLO; the various CORLEONE CHILDREN. INT DAY: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946) The DON is made comfortable in his room, which has all but been converted into a hospital room, with complete and extensive equipment. ,27
The various CHILDREN get a turn to kiss the OLD MAN, as he is made comfortable... and then SONNY indicates that all the CHILDREN, WOMEN, and CARLO should leave. ,2
INT DAY: DON'S DINING ROOM (SPRING 1946) The mood is quite happy downstairs, as the WOMEN prepare the Sunday dinner, and set the table. ,3
CARLO sits alone among them, a frown on his face. ,2
CONNIE What's the matter, Carlo? ,13
CARLO Shut up. ,520
HAGEN is the spokesman for the family. ,3
HAGEN ...since McCluskey's killing, the police have cracked down on most of our operations...on the other families too. ,4
There's been a lot of bad blood. ,29
The OLD MAN glances at SONNY. SONNY Pop, they hit us and we hit them back. ,256000
The OLD MAN nods. ,16700000
SONNY Freddie's gonna go to Las Vegas...under the protection of Don Francesco of L.A. ,3
I want him to rest... ,9
FREDO I'm goin' to learn the casino business. ,3
The DON nods approvingly. ,1070000
Then he searches around the room for a face he does not see. ,3
HAGEN knows who he's looking for. ,2
HAGEN Michael... (he takes a breath) It was Michael who killed Sollozzo. ,3
The DON closes his eyes, and then reopens them in anger and rage. ,3
HAGEN He's safe now...we're already working on ways to bring him back. ,3
The DON is very angry, he motions with a weak hand that they leave him alone. ,3
INT. DAY: DON'S STAIRS AND HALL (SPRING 1946) HAGEN is very upset as he comes down the Stairs; SONNY is expansive and optimistic. ,3
SONNY We'll let the old man take it easy for a couple of weeks. ,2
I want to get things going good before he gets better. ,2360000
What's the matter with you? ,1170000
HAGEN You start operating, the five families will start their raids again. ,2
We're at a stalemate Sonny, your war is costing us a lot of money. ,2
SONNY No more stalemate Tom, we got the soldiers, we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it. ,3
They know me for what I am, Tom-- and they're scared of me. ,2
HAGEN Yes. ,6190
SONNY Well it's war! We might not be in this shape if we had a real war- time Consiglere, a Sicilian. ,2
Pop had Genco, who do I have? (TOM starts to leave) Hey Tom, hey...hey. ,2
Don't be sore. ,3850000
INT DAY: DON'S DINING ROOM (SPRING 1946) The FAMILY, WIVES, CHILDREN and all sit around the table over Sunday dinner. ,3
EXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946) SOME of the CORLEONE GRANDCHILDREN play in the enclosed Mall, in the proximity of the BUTTON MEN stationed liberally by the gate. ,2
ONE CHILD misses a ball, it rolls by the gate house. ,3
A young BUTTON MAN scoops it up and throws it back, smiling. -----------------------------------------FADE OUT------- INT DAY: CONNIE'S APT. (SPRING 1946) CONNIE and CARLO's apartment. ,2
CONNIE Who is this? ,13
GIRL (O.S.) (giggle) I'm a friend of Carlo's. ,2
I just wanted to tell him I can't see him tonight; I have to go out of town. ,16300000
CONNIE's face turns red. ,6
CONNIE You lousy tramp bitch. (click) She slams the phone down; just as CARLO is coming out of the bathroom drying his golden body. ,3470
CARLO What was that? ,9
CONNIE Your girl friend. ,1
She says she can't make it tonight. ,16700000
You lousy bastard you have the nerve to give your whores my telephone number. ,3
CARLO (defending himself) You're crazy. ,3
She was kidding around; I don't know, some nut. ,2
He pushes her aside, and moves into the bedroom to continue dressing. ,2
CONNIE You're staying home. ,2
You're not going out. ,1020000
CARLO OK, OK. You gonna make me something to eat at least? ,2
That calms her down; she stands there a moment, breathing heavily; and then she nods, and goes into the kitchen, and starts her wifely duties. ,2
CARLO is dressed; puts on some cologne; CONNIE appears in the doorway. ,19500
CONNIE The food is on the table. ,52200000
CARLO I'm not hungry yet. ,7
CONNIE Eat it, it's on the table. ,4
CARLO Ba Fa Goulle. ,6
CONNIE BA FA GOULE YOU! She turns deliberately, goes out into the kitchen. ,5
A moment later we begin to hear the sound of dishes breaking. ,6
CARLO slowly walks out, where we can see CONNIE systematically smashing all the dishes against the sink, sending the greasy veal and peppers all over the apartment floor. ,4
CARLO You filthy guinea spoiled brat. ,6
Clean it up or I'll kick your head in. ,1
CONNIE Like hell I will. ,2
She stands there, solid, ready to punch him again. ,5
Slowly, he slides his belt out of his trousers, and doubles it in his hand. ,4
CARLO Clean it up! He swings the belt against her heavy hips. ,5
She moves back into the kitchen, and gets a kitchen knife, and holds it ready. ,3
CARLO Even the female Corleones are murderers. ,4
He puts the strap down on a table, and moves after her. ,2
She makes a sudden thrust at his groin, which he avoids. ,3
He pulls the knife away, cutting his hand in the process. ,4
She gets away momentarily, but he pursues her around the table, gets her; and starts to slap her in the face. ,5
She breaks away from him, and rushes into the bedroom. ,3
CONNIE The baby! The baby! INT DAY: CONNIE'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946) She runs into the bedroom; he follows. ,3
She moves into a corner, and then like a desperate animal, tries to hide under the bed. ,4
He reaches under, and pulls her out by the hair. ,3
He slaps her in the face until she begins to weep; then he throws her on the bed, contemptuously. ,3
He grabs part of her thigh, pinching it very hard. ,3
CARLO You're fat as a pig. ,3840000
Then he pushes her away, and walks out of the room, leaving her in tears. ,3
She is crying; she pulls herself to the bedroom phone, and in a whisper: CONNIE Mama...mama, it's Connie. ,2
Mama, I can't talk any louder. ,3
No, I don't want to talk to Sonny. ,2
CONNIE (O.S.) Sonny, just send a car to bring me home. ,2
I'll tell you then, it's nothing Sonny, don't you come. ,8
Send TOM, please Sonny, it's nothing; I just want to come home. ,9
SONNY's face is turning red. ,3
SONNY (in a controlled voice) You wait there. ,2
You just wait there. ,47
He hangs up the phone; and just stands there for a moment. ,1
SONNY (quietly) That sonofabitch; that sonofabitch... ,5
HAGEN enters the room; he knows what is happening, knows he cannot interfere. ,2
EXT DAY: MALL SONNY leaves the house. ,2
HAGEN moves to the outside mall just as SONNY's car is driving off. ,2
He moves to a group of BUTTON MEN. HAGEN Go after him. ,2
EXT DAY: CAUSEWAY (SPRING 1946) SONNY's car on the Jones Beach Causeway, speeds quickly by. ,3
After a pause, another car, with the CORLEONE BODYGUARDS, is trailing. ,2
SONNY is driving; he is very angry. ,2
EXT NITE: TOLL BOOTHS (SPRING 1946) SONNY in his car; driving back. ,2
Still breathing hard and still furious. ,1
Then he thinks it's funny; he enjoyed it. ,1
HAGEN (O.S.) This is Tom Hagen. ,2
I'm calling for Don Corleone, at his request. ,12
BONASERA looks at his WIFE, with deep anxiety in his eyes. ,3
BONASERA's lips are suddenly dry. ,2
BONASERA Yes, I understand. ,2
I'm listening. ,599000
HAGEN (O.S.) You owe the Don a service. ,2
In one hour, not before, perhaps later, he will be at your funeral parlor to ask for your help. ,13
Be there to greet him. ,54500
If you have any objections speak now, and I'll inform him. ,4
BONASERA stutters, then speaks in fright. ,6
BONASERA Anything...Anything the Godfather wishes. ,4
HAGEN (O.S.) Good. ,2
He never doubted you. ,831000
BONASERA The Don himself is coming to me tonight? ,3
HAGEN (O.S.) Yes. (click) BONASERA is sweating; slowly he lowers the phone; his WIFE sees his pale expression, and follows him into the room. ,2
Silently, he begins the ritual of dressing. ,2
His WIFE knows something serious is happening, and never takes her eyes from him. ,4
He lights a cigarette. ,14600
BONASERA For the last year, they have been killing one another. ,2
So now, what? ,375000
Your Godfather comes to me...Why? (whispering, slyly) They've killed someone so important that they wish to make his body disappear. ,2
MRS. BONASERA (frightened) Amerigo! BONASERA They could make me an accomplice to their murder. ,3
They could send me to jail! He slips into his trousers. ,3
Then he moves to his WIFE to tie his tie, as she has done for years. ,3
BONASERA And if the other families find out...they will make me their enemy. ,3
I curse the day I ever went to the Godfather. ,4
EXT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR (SPRING 1946) With his ring of keys, he opens the funeral parlor, enters. ,3
INT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR (SPRING 1946) BONASERA walks through the darkened funeral parlor, without turning on the lights; then into the rear, preparation room, past the tables, and equipment. ,3
He operates the chain that lifts a large overhead garage type door. ,87400
He sits on a bench, and waits. ,777000
CLEMENZA gets out, and moves to the open, rear door. ,5
BONASERA greets him, too petrified to speak. ,4
He notices TWO OTHER MEN get out of the car, and carry a stretcher with a CORPSE swaddled in a gray blanket, with yellowed feet protruding. ,5
BONASERA closes his eyes in fear, but indicates which way the MEN should carry their sinister burden. ,3
INT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR EMBALMING ROOM (SPRING 1946) They carry the CORPSE to one of the tables in the embalming room. ,4
Then BONASERA turns to see ANOTHER MAN step out of the darkness somewhat uncertainly. ,5
It is DON CORLEONE. He walks up to BONASERA, very close, without speaking. ,723000
His cold eyes looking directly at the frightened UNDERTAKER. Then, after a long gaze: DON CORLEONE Well my friend, are you ready to do me this service? ,2
BONASERA nods. ,5
The DON moves to the CORPSE on the embalming table; he makes a gesture, and the OTHER MEN leave them alone. ,3
BONASERA What do you wish me to do? ,4
DON CORLEONE (staring at the table) I want you to use all your powers, all your skill, as you love me. ,3
He draws down the gray blanket. ,4
The windows of his car are shot out. ,2
Bullet holes puncture the doors of his car. ,4
His hand, with the coin in it, falls inside the car. ,3
His arms, shoulders are riddled by the fire, and still it continues, as though the ASSASSINS cannot take a chance that he will survive it. ,3
Suddenly, he lets out an enormous ROAR, like a bull, and actually, opens the door, and steps out of the car, UNDER fire. ,3
His face is hit; and finally he falls to the ground. ,2
A FULL SHOT...as the ASSASSINS scramble for their cars and make off in the distance. ,3
SONNY's BODYGUARDS stop a safe distance away, realizing they are too late. ,7860
INT NITE: DON'S LIVING ROOM (SPRING 1946) View on HAGEN's ashen face in the living room. ,3
He is silent a moment, and then: HAGEN (quietly) OK. Go to Clemenza's house and tell him to come here right away. ,2
He'll tell you what to do. ,4
The MEN leave him alone. ,1
He is quiet, standing in the middle of the living room a moment. ,2
He looks in the direction of the kitchen, where he can see fragments of MAMA moving around. ,4
INT NITE: UPSTAIRS (SPRING 1946) TOM proceeds up stairs, and quietly in the direction of the DON's room. ,4
He opens the DON's door. ,78500000
Looks in. ,1850000
INT NITE: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946) The DON in his hospital bed. ,3
Asleep under sedation. ,3160
HAGEN hesitates. ,30
He cannot go in; he cannot tell the OLD MAN. He closes the door. ,1
INT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (SPRING 1946) HAGEN alone in the office. ,2
He is drinking. ,11500000
He looks up at the sound of cars; the CAPOREGIMES are arriving. ,3
Then he hears footsteps. ,3640
The door opens; and in a robe, with slippers, DON CORLEONE slowly enters the room. ,3
He walks directly to his stuffed armchair, sits down. ,4
His face is stern, as he looks into HAGEN's eyes. ,2
DON CORLEONE Give me a drop of anisette. ,3
So, Consigliere of mine, I think you should tell your Don what everyone knows. ,17
HAGEN (quietly) I didn't tell Mama anything. ,9
I was about to come up and wake you and tell you. ,1
Just now. ,3320000
DON CORLEONE But you needed a drink first. ,1220000
HAGEN Yes. ,6070
DON CORLEONE Now you've had your drink. ,2
HAGEN They shot Sonny on the Causeway. (pause) He's dead. ,3
DON CORLEONE blinks. ,10
DON CORLEONE I want no inquiries made. ,2860000
No acts of vengeance. (pause) Consigliere, arrange a meeting with the heads of the five families...this war stops now. ,3
He rises and unsteadily leaves the room, turns... ,3
DON CORLEONE Call Bonasera...he will do me a service. ,1
And leaves. ,6220000
HAGEN moves to the phone; dials... ,3
HAGEN This is Tom Hagen; I'm calling for Don Corleone, at his request. ,2
BONASERA (O.S.) Yes, I understand I'm listening. ,2
HAGEN You owe the Don a service. ,3
He has no doubt that you will repay it. ,16
EXT DAY: BANK BUILDING (SPRING 1946) Day in Manhattan. ,2
An impressive Bank Building in the financial center of New York. ,3
Many limousines are parked, uniforms and plain-clothed CHAUFFEURS waiting quietly. ,3
INT DAY: BOARD ROOM (SPRING 1946) The Board Room of a bank, daylight shines in the windows. ,2
I consider it a service done to me personally and I am in the debt of each and every one of you. ,10
Especially those of you who have traveled from such distances as California, St. Louis, Kansas City; and New Orleans... ,3
DON CORLEONE Ah well, let's get down to business. ,4
Well, no matter. ,255000
A lot of foolishness has come to pass. ,9
It was so unfortunate, so unnecessary. ,1070
The VIEW examines the room once again, as the DON speaks. ,3
A large, clicking board is changing numbers at various times, and two tapes, showing the fluctuations of the Market during the day's trading, and projected above. ,3
DON CORLEONE pauses; and TOM HAGEN hands him a cold drink. ,4
DON CORLEONE Tattaglia has lost a son; I have lost a son. ,6
We are quits. ,22600000
Let there be a peace... (he gestures expressively, submissively, with his hands) That is all I want... ,6
BARZINI Don Corleone is too modest. ,6
He had the judges and politicians in his pocket and he refused to share them. ,5
He takes the bread out of the mouths of our families. ,10
Times have changed, it's not like the old days where everyone can go his own way. ,9
If Don Corleone had all the judges and politicians in New York, then he must share them or let others use them. ,5
Certainly he can present a bill for such services, we're not Communists, after all. ,14
But he has to let us draw water from the well. ,2
It's that simple. ,2030000
DON CORLEONE My friends, I didn't refuse out of malice. ,7
You all know me. ,698000
When have I ever refused an accommodation? ,246000
But why, this time? ,13
Because I think this drug business will destroy us in the years to come. ,9
It's not like whiskey or gambling or even women which most people want and is forbidden them by the pezzonovante of the Church and the Government. ,21200
But drugs? ,51700
No. Even policemen, who help us in gambling and other things would refuse to help us in drugs. ,6
But...I am willing to do whatever all of you think is necessary. ,6
DON ZALUCHI I don't believe in drugs. ,5
For years I paid my people extra so they wouldn't do that kind of business...$200 a week. ,5
But it didn't matter. ,1340000
Somebody comes to them and says, "I have powders, if you put up three, four thousand dollar investment, we can make fifty thousand distributing." Who can resist such a profit? ,22300
That is an infamita. (thinking) In my city I would try to keep the traffic in the dark people, the colored. ,3
They are the best customers, the least troublesome, and they are animals anyway. ,18
They have no respect for their wives or their families or themselves. ,4
Let them lose their souls with drugs. ,16
But something has to be done, we can't have everybody running around doing just what they please, like a bunch of anarchists. ,3
BARZINI Then, are we agreed; the traffic in drugs will be permitted, but controlled; and Don Corleone agrees to give it protection in the East. ,3
DON CORLEONE nods. ,8
TATTAGLIA I agree to everything here, I'm willing to forget my own misfortune. ,3
But I must hear strict assurance from Corleone. ,3
When time goes by and his position becomes stronger, will he attempt any individual vengeance? ,76100
They all look at the DON; especially HAGEN, who feels that DON CORLEONE has given a great deal, and must have something else in mind. ,4
Slowly the DON rises. ,3
DON CORLEONE I forego my vengeance for my dead son, for the common good. ,4
But I have selfish reasons. ,3630
My youngest son had to flee, accused of Sollozzo's murder, and I must now make arrangements so that he can come home with safety, cleared of all those false charges. ,5
That is my affair, and I will make those arrangements. (with strength) But I am a superstitious man...and so if some unlucky accident should befall my youngest son, if some police officer should accidentally shoot him, or if he should hang himself in his cell, or if my son is struck by a bolt of lightning, then I will blame some of the people here. ,672
EXT NITE: DON'S LIMO (SPRING 1946) The DON's black limousine. ,3
He sits quietly in the padded rear seat; TOM HAGEN next to him. ,3
It is night. ,312000
Lights flash by them every so often. ,1
HAGEN When I meet with Tattaglia's people; should I insist that all his drug middle-men be clean? ,3
DON CORLEONE Mention it, don't insist. ,27
Barzini is a man who will know that without being told. ,35800
HAGEN You mean Tattaglia. ,36
DON CORLEONE (shaking his head) Barzini. ,3
HAGEN (a revelation) He was the one behind Sollozzo? ,2
DON CORLEONE Tattaglia is a pimp. ,29
He could never have outfought Santino. ,2110
But I wasn't sure until this day. ,1
No, it was Barzini all along. ,14
GRADUALLY, THE VIEW LOOSENS, he wears a warm navy Pea jacket, and walks with his hands in his pockets. ,3
Each of the SHEPHERDS carry knapsacks. ,2
The THREE YOUNG MEN continue over the Sicilian landscape, overlooking an impressive view of land and sea. ,2
EXT DAY: SICILY ROAD The THREE move through a flock of wind-blown sheep, and make their way to a dusty rural road. ,3
We HEAR a rinky horn sound, as a pre-war Italian automobile makes its way to them. ,3
An OLD MAN peeks from the window, waving to MICHAEL. The car pulls in front of them and stops. ,2
MICHAEL nods respectfully. ,8
MICHAEL Don Tommassino. ,5
DON TOMMASSINO Michael, why must you do this. ,3
We have been lucky so far, all these months you've been here we've kept your name a secret. ,2
It is from love for your father that I've asked you never to more than an hour from the Villa. ,3
MICHAEL Calo and Fabrizzio are with me; nothing will happen. ,3
DON TOMMASSINO You must understand that your Father's enemies have friends in Palermo. ,3
MICHAEL I know. ,362000
DON TOMMASSINO Where are you going? ,4
MICHAEL Corleone. ,274000
DON TOMMASSINO There is nothing there. ,3
MICHAEL I was told that my Grandfather was murdered on its main street; and his murderers came to kill my father there when he was twelve years old. ,3
DON TOMMASSINO Long ago. ,3
Now there is nothing: the men killed each other in family vendettas...the others escaped to America. ,3
MICHAEL Don Tommassino...I should see this place. ,3
DON TOMMASSINO thinks a moment, then concedes. ,5
DON TOMMASSINO That is your birthright...but Michael, use this car. ,39700
MICHAEL No...I would like to walk to Corleone. ,3
The OLD MAN sighs, and then returns to his car. ,4
DON TOMMASSINO Be careful Michael, don't let them know your name. ,3
The old car sputters off; MICHAEL watches, and then continues on his journey. ,4
EXT DAY: COUNTRYSIDE The THREE pass through abundant areas of flowers and fruit trees, in bloom and bursting with life. ,4
EXT DAY: VILLAGE They continue in the empty streets of a little town; the post-war poverty is evident in the skinny dogs; and the empty streets. ,3
Occasionally, a military vehicle, the only gasoline-powered vehicles on the road, will pass. ,4
And there are many POLICE evident, most of them carrying machine guns. ,3
The THREE pass under an enormous banner slung over the main road "VOTA COMMUNISTA". EXT DAY: COUNTRY ROAD They continue through dusty country roads, where occasionally a donkey pulling a cart, or a lone horseman will pass them. ,3
EXT DAY: FIELD Out in a field, in the distance, they come upon a procession of peasants and activists, perhaps two hundred strong, marching, and singing, and in the lead, are five or six men carrying billowing red banners. ,1570
EXT DAY: GROVE They are in an orange grove; on the other side of the trees is a deep, tall field of wild flowers. ,3
The Shepherds unsling their guns and knapsacks, and take out loaves of bread, some wine, sausage and cheese. ,3
MICHAEL rests against a tree, and uses his handkerchief. ,2
FABRIZZIO You tell us about America. ,2
MICHAEL How do you know I come from America? ,3
FABRIZZIO We hear. ,3
We were told you were a Pezzonovanta...big shot. ,2
MICHAEL Only the son of a Pezzonovanta. ,2
FABRIZZIO Hey America! Is she as rich as they say? ,1
MICHAEL Yes. ,67400
FABRIZZIO Take me to America! You need a good lupara in America? (pats his shotgun) You take me, I'll be the best man you got. "Oh say, can you seeee...By da star early light..." MICHAEL laughs. ,1
EXT DAY: ANOTHER ROAD The TRIO continues down a dirt road, as an American Military convoy speeds by; FABRIZZIO waves, and calls out to each of the U.S. drivers, as they move by. ,28
FABRIZZIO America. ,4
CALO Corleone. ,10
They can see a grim Sicilian village, almost devoid of people. ,3
EXT DAY: CORLEONE STREET MICHAEL and his bodyguards move through the empty streets of the village. ,4
They walk behind him, and spread to either side about fifteen feet away from him. ,3
They move down ancient steps, past an old stone fountain. ,171000
MICHAEL hesitates, cups his hands and drinks some water. ,3
They go on. ,3750000
They move up a very narrow old street. ,3
MICHAEL looks at the doorways that they pass. ,4
MOVING VIEW: Each door has a plaque, with a ribbon or flower. ,4
CALO sees MICHAEL looking. ,5
CALO The names of the dead. ,4
MICHAEL hesitates in the center of the main street. ,4
The street is empty, barren. ,2
Occasionally, an old woman will pass. ,3
MICHAEL turns his head. ,1820
The other side of the street: empty and deathly. ,2
Further ahead is a villa so Roman it looks as though it had just been discovered in the ruins of Pompeii. ,3
There is a group of young village GIRLS accompanied by two stocky MATRONS, dressed in black. ,4
They have been gathering the pink sulla, purple wisteria, and mixing them with orange and lemon blossoms. ,3
They are singing, off in the distance as they work. ,4
MICHAEL, CALO and FABRIZZIO are silent as they watch this Fantasy-like scene. ,3
FABRIZZIO (calling out to them) Hey, beautiful girls! MICHAEL (sternly) Shhhhh. ,12100
He settles down to watch. ,10
The GIRLS are dressed in cheap gaily painted frocks that cling to their bodies. ,2
They are still in their teens, but developed and womanly. ,2
They are moving along the fields, picking blossoms, not aware of the three men watching them from the orange grove. ,150000
Three or four of the girls begin chasing one of them playfully, in the direction of the grove. ,3
The GIRL being chased holds a bunch of purple grapes in her left hand and with the right, picks more grapes, and throws them back at her pursuers laughing. ,2
They come closer and closer. ,61700
Just short of the grove, she poses, startled, her large, oval shaped eyes catching the view of the THREE MEN. She stands there on her toes about to run. ,2
MICHAEL sees her; now face to face. ,2
Her face. ,9650000
Incredibly beautiful with olive skin, black hair and a rich mouth. ,2710000
FABRIZZIO (murmuring) Jesus Christ, take my soul. ,4
I'm dying. ,1070000
Quickly, she turns, and runs away. ,5
MICHAEL stands up never taking his eyes from her. ,3
We hold on him for a long while; and eventually hear the SHEPHERDS laughing. ,3
FABRIZZIO You got hit by the thunderbolt, eh? ,4
CALO pats him on the shoulder. ,4
CALO Easy man. ,3
MICHAEL What are you talking about? ,16000
FABRIZZIO You can't hide it when you're hit by the thunderbolt. ,3
EXT DAY: BARONIAL VILLAGE The little village built attendant to the Baronial Estate, is decked with the flowers the girls had been picking. ,3
MICHAEL, followed by the bodyguards, moves into the central square, and onto the balcony of a little cafe. ,2
The proprietor of the cafe, VITELLI, is a short burly man; he greets them cheerfully, and sets a dish of chickpeas at their table. ,2
FABRIZZIO You know all the girls in this town, eh? ,3
We saw some beauties coming down the road. ,12
One in particular got our friend hit with the Thunderbolt... (he indicates MICHAEL) VITELLI gives a big knowing laugh, and looks at MICHAEL with new interest. ,2
VITELLI You had better bring a few bottles home with you, my friend; you'll need help sleeping tonight. (he laughs) FABRIZZIO This one could seduce the devil. ,63
A body! and eyes as big and black as olives. ,5
VITELLI (laughing with them...pouring more wine) I know about what you mean! FABRIZZIO This was a beauty. ,2
Right, Calo? ,470
VITELLI (laughing) Beautiful all over, eh? ,2
FABRIZZIO And hair. ,3
Black and curly, like a doll. ,2
And such a mouth. ,21
VITELLI does not laugh quite so much. ,3
VITELLI Yes, we have beautiful girls here... but virtuous. ,3
VITELLI is no longer drinking with them. ,3
MICHAEL She wore a red dress, and a red ribbon in her hair. ,3
She looks more Greek than Italian. ,10
Do you know a beauty like that? ,1
As MICHAEL describes her, VITELLI laughed less and less, until he wears a scowl. ,4
VITELLI No. Then he curtly leaves him, and walks into the back room. ,3
FABRIZZIO God in Heaven, I think I understand... ,3
He goes into the back room after the innkeeper. ,3
Then he returns. ,157000
FABRIZZIO Let's get out of here; he's boiling up his blood to do us mischief. ,4
It's his daughter. ,55300000
They start to leave; but MICHAEL doesn't move. ,1
CALO Come quickly. ,5
MICHAEL Innkeeper. ,2350
More wine! FABRIZZIO (whispered) The old bastard mentioned two sons he only has to whistle up. ,4
MICHAEL turns to FABRIZZIO with his cold authority. ,7
MICHAEL Tell him to come to me. ,1
The two BODYGUARDS shoulder their luparas, and disappear in a moment they return with the red-faced angry VITELLI between them. ,4
MICHAEL (quietly) I understand I've offended you by talking about your daughter. ,3
I offer you my apologies, I'm a stranger in this country, I don't know the customs very well. ,4
Let me say this, I meant no disrespect to you or her... ,9
CALO and FABRIZZIO are impressed. ,7
VITELLI (shrugs) Who are you and what do you want from my daughter? ,4
MICHAEL I am an American hiding in Sicily from the police of my country. ,996000
My name is Michael. ,499000
You can inform the police and make your fortune but then your daughter would lose a father rather than gain a husband. ,13
In any case, I want to meet your daughter. ,2
With your permission and under the supervision of your family. ,7440
With all decorum. ,1840
With all respect. ,123000
I am an honorable man. ,98900
CALO and FABRIZZIO are stupefied; VITELLI pauses, and then asks: VITELLI Are you a friend of the friends? ,3
MICHAEL When the proper time comes, I'll tell you everything that a wife's father should know. ,3
FABRIZZIO It's the real Thunderbolt, then. ,3
VITELLI (formally) Come Sunday morning: My name is Vitelli and my house is up there on the hill, above the village. ,34
MICHAEL Your daughter's name? ,4
VITELLI Appolonia. -------------------------------------FADE OUT----------- EXT DAY: TOMMASSINO COURTYARD MUSIC comes up; as MICHAEL, dressed in new clothes from Palermo, and carrying a stack of wrapped gifts, gets into an Alfa Romeo. ,1
CALO and FABRIZZIO each dressed in their Sunday best, are in the rear seat, huddled together, with their luparas on their shoulders. ,3
DON TOMMASSINO waves them off, as the little car drives off, rocky and bouncing on the dirt road. ,4
Now he presents the wrapped gift to APPOLONIA. She looks at her MOTHER, who with a nod gives her permission to open it. ,2030
She unwraps it. ,2830
Her eyes light at the sight of a heavy gold chain; to be worn as a necklace. ,3
APPOLONIA Grazia. --------------------------------------DISSOLVE---------- EXT DAY: VITELLI CAFE Now the little Alpha drives into the village near VITELLI's cafe. ,2
MICHAEL is, as ever, accompanied with his two BODYGUARDS, though they are all dressed differently. ,2
They go up to the cafe...and sit with VITELLI, who is talking and talking. ,2
MICHAEL looks at APPOLONIA; who sits, respectfully quiet. ,3
She wears the gold necklace around her neck. --------------------------------------DISSOLVE---------- EXT DAY: HILLTOP NEAR VITELLI HOME MICHAEL and APPOLONIA are walking through a hilltop path, seemingly alone, although a respectful distance apart. ,2
Further up the hill, APPOLONIA stumbles on a loose stone, and falls briefly onto MICHAEL's arm. ,2
She modestly regains her balance, and they continue walking. ,1150000
Behind them, her MOTHER giggles to herself. --------------------------------------DISSOLVE---------- EXT DAY: VITELLI VILLAGE CHURCH Church bells in an ancient belfry ring out. ,1
Music, old and dissonant, plays. ,1
There is a bridal procession in the street of the village; the same in feeling and texture as it might have been five hundred years ago. ,2
We present the entire bridal procession and ceremony with all the ritual and pageantry, as it has always been, in Sicily. ,3
He turns, and there, in her wedding slip, is APPOLONIA. A little frightened; but lovely. ,1
He moves to her; and for a moment just stands before her, looking at her incredible face; her lovely hair and body. ,1
Slowly and tenderly he kisses her. ,2
Her tiny hands come up to his face; touch his cheek and embrace him. ,3
She lets her bridal slip fall to the floor. --------------------------------------FADE OUT---------- INT DAY: MICHAEL'S ROOM AT VILLA Morning. ,1
MICHAEL sits on the window ledge, gazing into the room. ,1
APPOLONIA is asleep; she is naked, and only partially covered by the bedsheets. ,2
APPOLONIA is laughing, driving. ,2
MICHAEL pretends to be frightened, as he teaches her to drive. ,68000
Outside the walls, we notice SHEPHERDS with luparas, walking guard duty. ,2
The car stops and a laughing MICHAEL gets out. ,368000
MICHAEL It's safer to teach you English. ,3
APPOLONIA Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday...See, I learned it. ,21900000
Now teach me to drive! DON TOMMASSINO enters the Courtyard. ,2
He seems tired and concerned. ,2
MICHAEL Ciao, Don Tommassino. ,5
APPOLONIA kisses him. ,4
MICHAEL Things went badly in Palermo? ,2
DON TOMMASSINO The younger men have no respect. ,2
Michael, because of the wedding, people now know your name. ,2
MICHAEL Is that why there are more men on the walls? ,1
DON TOMMASSINO Even so, I don't think it is safe here anymore. ,1
I've made plans to move you to a villa near Siracuse. ,1
You must go right away. ,1
MICHAEL What is it? ,32
DON TOMMASSINO Bad news from America. ,1
Your brother, Santino. ,311
He has been killed. ,366000
For a moment, the whole world of New York, Sollozzo, the Five Family War, all comes back to MICHAEL. EXT DAY: VILLA COURTYARD Morning. ,1
MICHAEL leans out of the bedroom window. ,1
Below, FABRIZZIO is sitting in one of the garden chairs, combing his thick hair. ,1
MICHAEL whistles and FABRIZZIO looks up to his window. ,1
MICHAEL Get the car. ,6
I'll be leaving in ten minutes. ,9
Where's Calo? ,6610000
FABRIZZIO Calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen. ,1
Is your wife coming with you? ,27
MICHAEL No, she's going home to her family. ,3
INT DAY: VILLA KITCHEN MICHAEL, dressed, crosses from the hallway, and into the kitchen. ,1
CALO is just finishing a bite. ,2950000
He rises when he sees MICHAEL. CALO Should I get your bag? ,1
MICHAEL No, I'll get it. ,39000000
Where's Appolonia? ,5
CALO (smiling) She is sitting in the driver's seat of the car, dying to step on the gas. ,1
She'll be a real American woman before she gets to America. ,9
MICHAEL smiles. ,6120
MICHAEL Tell Fabrizzio and wait for me in the car. ,2
He leaves the kitchen, after a quick sip of coffee. ,1
He looks out from the opening in the doorway. ,1
EXT DAY: VILLA COURTYARD There is the car, with APPOLONIA sitting in the driver's seat, playing with the wheel like a child. ,2
CALO moves to the car, and puts a lunch basket in the rear seat. ,1
Then MICHAEL seems disturbed. ,2
Over, on the other side of the courtyard, he sees FABRIZZIO disappear through the gate. ,1
MICHAEL (muttering to himself) Where the hell is he going? ,1
MICHAEL goes down the hallway, and outside. ,1
MICHAEL steps out into the bright sunlight of the outer courtyard, causing him to shade his eyes. ,2
APPOLONIA sees him, and waves, motioning that he should stay where he is. ,1
APPOLONIA (calling out) I'll drive to you. ,1
He smiles affectionately. ,3040000
CALO stands beside the car, smiling, with his lupara dangling by his side. ,1
There is no sight of FABRIZZIO. Suddenly the smile fades from MICHAEL's face. ,1
He steps forward and holds out his hand. ,4
Part of the wall is caved in, the kitchen door is blown off; and there is nothing left of the Alpha, or of Appolonia. ,2
MICHAEL is thrown against the wall, and knocked unconscious. ,2
INT DAY: VILLA BEDROOM MICHAEL is unconscious in a darkened room. ,1
We hear whispering around him, but can't make any of it out. ,1150000
A soft cloth is applied to his face; gradually his eyes open. ,2
DON TOMMASSINO is there, close to him. ,1
He looks at them and from their grave expressions, he knows his wife is dead. ,1
MICHAEL Fabrizzio. ,916
Let your shepherds know that the one who gives me Fabrizzio will own the finest pastures in Sicily. --------------------------------------FADE OUT---------- FADE IN: EXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1951) Easter. ,1
A HIGH VIEW ON THE CORLEONE MALL in the springtime. ,2
Hordes of little CHILDREN including many of the Corleone Children and Grandchilren, rush about carrying little Easter baskets, searching here and there for candy treasures and hidden Easter eggs. ,1
Suddenly, he stops and looks. ,13
MICHAEL stands there, still holding his suitcase. ,1
DON CORLEONE Be my son... ,106000
INT DAY: THE OLIVE OIL FACTORY DON CORLEONE leads MICHAEL through the corridors of the building. ,2820
DON CORLEONE Have you thought about a wife? ,2
A family? ,16500000
MICHAEL (pained) No. DON CORLEONE I understand, Michael. ,2
MICHAEL I want children, I want a family. ,1
But I don't know when. ,50
DON CORLEONE Accept what's happened, Michael. ,2
MICHAEL I could accept everything that's happened; I could accept it, but that I never had a choice. ,3
From the time I was born, you had laid this all out for me. ,2
DON CORLEONE No, I wanted other things for you. ,2
MICHAEL You wanted me to be your son. ,2
DON CORLEONE Yes, but sons who would be professors, scientists, musicians...and grandchildren who could be, who knows, a Governor, a President even, nothing's impossible here in America. ,1
MICHAEL Then why have I become a man like you? ,3
DON CORLEONE You are like me, we refuse to be fools, to be puppets dancing on a string pulled by other men. ,3
I hoped the time for guns and killing and massacres was over. ,7
That was my misfortune. ,8
That was your misfortune. ,3
I was hunted on the streets of Corleone when I was twelve years old because of who my father was. ,4
I had no choice. ,414000
MICHAEL A man has to choose what he will be. ,1
DON CORLEONE What else do you believe in? ,5
MICHAEL doesn't answer. ,1390
DON CORLEONE Believe in a family. ,2
Those Pezzonovante of the State who decide what we shall do with our lives? ,2
Who declare wars they wish us to fight in to protect what they own. ,25
Do you put your fate in the hands of men whose only talent is that they tricked a bloc of people to vote for them? ,2
Michael, in five years the Corleone family can be completely legitimate. ,3
Very difficult things have to happen to make that possible. ,3
I can't do them anymore, but you can, if you choose to. ,7120000
MICHAEL listens. ,2660
DON CORLEONE Believe in a family; believe in a Code of Honor, older and higher, believe in Roots that go back thousands of years into your Race. ,2
Make a family, Michael, and protect it. ,4
These are our affairs, sono cosa nostra, Governments only protect men who have their own individual power. ,3
Be one of those men...you have the choice. --------------------------------------FADE OUT---------- EXT DAY: STOCK FOOTAGE LAS VEGAS (1955) A MOVING VIEW, driving up the Las Vegas Strip of 1955. ,1
FREDO (O.S.) There's a new one. ,1
Construction going on everywhere. ,2140
MORE VIEWS, showing new hotels and casinos being built; the bill marquees read: "MARTIN AND LEWIS", "PATTI PAGE", etc. ,3
FREDO (O.S.) That's one of the family's new ones. ,1
Not bad, eh? ,42800
EXT DAY: FLAMINGO (1955) The car pulls up at the Flamingo Hotel. ,3
Inside the car: MICHAEL, FREDO, TOM HAGEN and a new man, NERI, quiet and sinister. ,717
MICHAEL Why didn't Moe Green meet us at the airport? ,4
FREDO He had business at the hotel, but he'll drop in for dinner. ,3
From the expression on MICHAEL's face we know this is a discourtesy. ,1
INT DAY: FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE (1955) A whole entourage precedes FREDO and his V.I.P. party of MICHAEL, HAGEN and NERI. Great fuss is made. ,1
They are being shown into the hotel's 'special' suite. ,1
FREDO You look wonderful, kid; really wonderful. ,1
That doctor did some job on your face. ,2
MICHAEL You look good, too. ,6
They enter the suite. ,5350
FREDO Nice, eh? ,7
FREDO is as excited as a kid, snapping orders at the bellboys, waiters and maids. ,2
FREDO (hurrying into the bedroom) Kid, take a look-see. ,3
There is an enormous circular bed on a huge platform, mirrors to each side. ,79400
FREDO points upward. ,3
A VIEW into a large CEILING mirror. ,2
FREDO Ever seen anything like that before? ,32800000
He is just finishing dressing; he puts on his jacket. ,1
From the window, with the lights blinking, we can tell it's late at night. ,1
MICHAEL passes into the other room. ,1
He stops, looks. ,10200000
He is disturbed. ,97000
INT NITE: FLAMINGO SUITE (1955) A magnificent, circular table has been set up in his suite; a lavish table setting for eight. ,17500
FREDO Mike! The party starting! MICHAEL Come here a minute, Fredo. ,3
FREDO goes to him, a big smile all over his face. ,3
FREDO Mike! MICHAEL Get rid of them... ,1
INT NITE: FLAMINGO SUITE (1955) They are seated around the lavish table in Michael's suite. ,1
MICHAEL is speaking to JOHNNY. MICHAEL Johnny, the Corleone family is thinking of selling out all our interests in the Olive Oil business and settling here. ,84000
Moe Greene will sell us his interest so it can be wholly owned by friends of the family. ,14
FREDDIE seems anxious. ,6
FREDO Mike, you sure about Moe selling. ,3
He never mentioned it to me and he loves the business. ,10
MICHAEL I'll make him an offer he can't refuse. ,5090
MICHAEL turns to JOHNNY. MICHAEL Johnny, the Don wants you to help us get started. ,1
We figure entertainment will be the big factor in drawing gamblers. ,2400000
We hope you'll sign a contract to appear five times a year for maybe a week long engagement. ,10
We count on you to convince them. ,1
JOHNNY Sure, I'll do anything for my Godfather. ,1
You know that, Mike. ,241000
There is knock on the door. ,2
NERI rises, looks at MICHAEL, who nods. ,2
NERI opens the door, and MOE GREENE enters, followed by TWO BODYGUARDS. He is a handsome hood, dressed in the Hollywood style. ,2
His BODYGUARDS are more West Coast style. ,3
MOE Mike, good to see you. ,3
Got everything you want? ,669000
MICHAEL Thanks. ,116000
MICHAEL Is my credit good enough to buy you out? ,9
MOE laughs. ,1160
MOE Buy me out?... ,12
MICHAEL The hotel, the casino. ,34
The Corleone family wants to buy you out. ,95
GREENE stops laughing; the room becomes tense. ,15800
NERI eyes the BODYGUARDS. MOE (furious) The Corleone family wants to buy me out. ,2
I buy you out. ,145000000
You don't buy me out. ,14
MICHAEL Your casino loses money. ,515
Maybe we can do better. ,124000
MOE You think I scam? ,3
MICHAEL (the worst insult) You're unlucky. ,3
MOE You goddamn dagos. ,7
I do you a favor and take Freddie in when you're having a bad time, and then you try to push me out. ,36
MICHAEL You took Freddie in because the Corleone family bankrolled your casino. ,19
You and the Corleone family are evened out. ,4
MOE The Corleone family don't have that kind of muscle anymore. ,24200
The Godfather is sick. ,16
You're getting chased out of New York by Barzini and the other families, and you think you can find easier pickings here. ,3
I've talked to Barzini; I can make a deal with him and keep my hotel! MICHAEL (quietly, deadly) Is that why you thought you could slap Freddie around in public? ,3
FREDO (his face turns red) Ah Mike, that was nothing. ,3
Moe didn't mean anything. ,15
He flies off the handle sometimes; but me and him are good friends. ,14
Right, Moe? ,9730000
MOE Yeah sure. ,43
Sometimes I gotta kick asses to make this place run right. ,5
Freddie and I had a little argument and I had to straighten him out. ,3
MICHAEL You straightened my brother out? ,2540
MOE Hell, he was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time. ,6
Players couldn't get a drink. ,1170
MICHAEL rises from his chair, and says in a tone of dismissal: MICHAEL I have to go back to New York tomorrow. ,3
Think of your price. ,3
MOE You son of a bitch, you think you can brush me off like that? ,3
I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders. ,8330
FREDO (frightened) Tom, you're the Consigliere; you can talk to the Don and advise him. ,3
MICHAEL The Don has semi-retired. ,3
I'm running the Family business now. ,7
Nobody answers. ,67400
MICHAEL nods to NERI, who opens the door. ,3
MOE exits angrily. ,5
MICHAEL Freddie, you're my older brother. ,12
But don't ever take sides with anybody against the Family again. ,3510000
Two other cars are stationed discreetly, with men we have learned to tell are bodyguards. ,1
MICHAEL, HAGEN and NERI exit the airport with TWO NEGRO PORTERS carrying luggage. ,6780
HAGEN gets into one of the other cars. ,1
MICHAEL I have to see my father and his people when we get back to the Mall. ,2
KAY Oh Michael. ,797
KAY Don't you want dinner first? ,134000000
KAY Wake me up when you come to bed? ,1
The little BOY flies his cardboard bird out of the speeding limousine window. ,1
EXT DAY: MALL (1955) The limousine arrives at the Mall. ,1
We are inside. ,575000
KAY Your sister wants to ask you something. ,1
MICHAEL Let HER ask. ,2
NERI opens the door. ,17
KAY wants to talk just a little more. ,1
KAY She's afraid to. ,2
Michael... ,22200000
MICHAEL nods to NERI; who gives them their privacy a moment longer. ,3
KAY Why are you so cold to her and Carlo? ,4
They live with us on the Mall now, but you never get close to them. ,4
MICHAEL I'm busy. ,50
KAY Connie and Carlo want you to be godfather to their little boy. ,4
NERI opens the door; MICHAEL starts to get out; KAY too. ,2
He smiles at her, tired, and a little sad. ,1
KAY Will you? ,2670
MICHAEL Let me think about it, O.K.? She smiles; MICHAEL goes with NERI to the Main House; KAY and the little BOY move to the house that was Sonny's. ,1
INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (1955) VIEW ON DON CORLEONE, much older, much smaller in size. ,1
He wears baggy pants, and a warm plaid shirt. ,1
He sits in a chair, gazing out through the window, into the garden. ,2
TESSIO (O.S.) Barzini's people chisel my territory and we do nothing about it. ,1
Pretty soon there won't be one place in Brooklyn I can hang my hat. ,10
MICHAEL (O.S.) Just be patient. ,1
TESSIO I'm not asking you for help, Mike. ,1
Just take off the handcuffs. ,17
CLEMENZA (O.S.) We gotta fight sometime. ,1600000
Let us at least recruit our regimes to full strength. ,2
MICHAEL (O.S.) No, I don't want to give Barzini an excuse to start fighting. ,1
TESSIO (O.S.) Mike, you're wrong. ,1
CLEMENZA (O.S.) Don Corleone...Don Corleone. ,1
The OLD MAN looks up. ,5380
CLEMENZA stand before him in the Den. ,2
Beside him is an anxious TESSIO. NERI stands by the door; HAGEN is seated; MICHAEL sits behind the big desk. ,1
CLEMENZA You said there would come a day when Tessio and me could form our own Families. ,1
Only with your benediction, of course. ,2
I ask permission... ,44300
DON CORLEONE My son is head of the Family now. ,2150000
If you have his permission, you have my good will. ,1
MICHAEL In six months you can break off from the Corleone Family and go on your own. ,1
Carlo, I'm counting on you to make the move to Nevada; you'll be my right-hand man out there. ,2
Tom Hagen is no longer the Consigliere. ,10
Everyone is a bit surprised; look to see HAGEN's reaction. ,2
He remains inexpressive. ,16500
MICHAEL He's going to be our lawyer in Vegas. ,1
Nobody goes to him with any other business as of now, this minute. ,9
No reflection on Tom; that's the way I want it. ,1630000
Besides, if I ever need any advice, who's a better Consigliere than my father. ,2
CLEMENZA Then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it? ,2
MICHAEL Maybe less... ,22
How can you hope for success there without your strength here to back you up? ,11
The two go hand in hand. ,392000
CLEMENZA And I don't like Barzini. ,3
I say the Corleone Family has to move from strength, not weakness. ,1
We should build our Regimes and take back our lost territories in Staten Island, at least. ,1
DON CORLEONE Do you have faith in my judgement? ,24
CLEMENZA Yes, Godfather... ,18
DON CORLEONE Then do what Michael says... ,3
CARLO Understood. ,411
MICHAEL I'll come to you when I need you. ,74900000
Then NERI closes the door. ,1
MICHAEL relaxes. ,1630
HAGEN Mike, why are you cutting me out of the action? ,3
MICHAEL Tom, we're going to be legitimate all the way, and you're the legal man. ,3
What could be more important than that. ,68900
HAGEN I'm not talking about that. ,3
I'm talking about Rocco Lampone building a secret regime. ,10
Why does Neri report directly to you, rather than through me or a caporegime? ,3
DON CORLEONE I told you that it wouldn't escape his eye. ,3
MICHAEL How did you find out? ,14
HAGEN Bookkeepers know everything. ,3
Rocco's men are all a little too good for the jobs they're supposed to be doing. ,4
They get a little more money than the job's worth. (pause) Lampone's a good man; he's operating perfectly. ,3
MICHAEL Not so perfectly if you noticed. ,4
HAGEN Mike, why am I out? ,55
MICHAEL You're not a wartime Consigliere. ,16
Things may get tough with the move we're trying. ,24
HAGEN OK, but then I agree with Tessio. ,4
You're going about it all wrong; you're making the move out of weakness... ,3
Barzini's a wolf, and if he tears you apart, the other families won't come running to help the Corleones... ,4
DON CORLEONE Tom, I never thought you were a bad Consigliere, I thought Santino a bad Don, rest in peace. ,5
He had a good heart but he wasn't the right man to head the family when I had my misfortune. ,2
Michael has all my confidence, as you do. ,7
For reasons which you can't know, you must have no part in what will happen. ,2
HAGEN Maybe I can help. ,3
MICHAEL (coldly) You're out, Tom. ,3
TOM pauses, thinks...and then he nods in acquiescence. ,3
TOM leaves. ,15900
MICHAEL looks at NERI. MICHAEL I'm going to talk to my father. ,2
NERI nods, and then leaves. ,2
The DON opens the doors, breathes in the air, and steps outside. ,216000
EXT DAY: THE GARDEN (1955) DON CORLEONE I see you have your Luca Brasi. ,5290
MICHAEL I'll need him. ,3
DON CORLEONE There are men in this world who demand to be killed. ,2
They argue in gambling games; they jump out of their cars in a rage if someone so much as scratches their fender. ,26
These people wander through the streets calling out "Kill me, kill me." Luca Brasi was like that. ,1
And since he wasn't scared of death, and in fact, looked for it...I made him my weapon. ,12
Because I was the only person in the world that he truly hoped would not kill him. ,14
They walk through the DON's vegetable garden. ,2
Tomatoes, peppers, carefully tended, and covered with a silky netting. ,1
MICHAEL follows; the DON turns and looks at him. ,3
Then stoops over to right a tomato plant that had been pushed over. ,1
DON CORLEONE Barzini will move against you first. ,5
MICHAEL How? ,173000
DON CORLEONE He will get in touch with you through someone you absolutely trust. ,3
That person will arrange a meeting, guarantee your safety... ,5
He rises, and looks at Michael... ,2
DON CORLEONE ...and at that meeting you will be assassinated. ,89300
MICHAEL Yes. ,44900
DON CORLEONE Good. ,1010000
A long silence. ,161000
KAY How is your husband feeling? ,24400000
He lets Michael do all the work. ,8
He just plays the fool with his garden, his peppers, his tomatoes, as if he was some peasant still. ,2
But men are like that... ,3
MAMA You come in, too. ,1
KAY shakes her head. ,376
KAY laughs and follows MAMA up the steps of the Church. ,2
INT DAY: CHURCH (1955) Inside the Church, KAY watches as MAMA blesses herself from the holy water. ,2
MAMA You can. ,365000
Tentatively, KAY dips her fingers into the water, and blesses herself. ,2
Then SHE follows MAMA down the aisle, in awe at the high ceiling, the art, the windows, and finally the Altar. ,4310
MAMA stops by the impressive tiers of candles. ,1
There is a large coin box for those who wish to pay for lighting candles. ,2
MAMA fumbles in her purse for change; KAY gives her some. ,1
She finishes, and bows her head. ,2
EXT DAY: BONASERA'S FUNERAL HOME Very few people in the streets. ,2
TOTAL SILENCE. But black flower cars as far as the eye can see, for blocks and blocks. ,1
An expression of respect, of honor and fear that is enormous. ,1
Certainly no more could be done for a President or a King. ,1
Each car carries an elaborate floral decoration. ,1
We show these in detail; and the flowered messages: "A Benefactor to Mankind", "He Knew and Pitied"..."Our Don Our Leader"..."The Sacred Heart"... ,1
EXT DAY: MALL (1955) HIGH ANGLE ON THE CORLEONE MALL Silence. ,3
The flower cars, funeral limousines, and private cars fill all the areas attendant to the Corleone residence. ,1
Hundreds of people fill the Mall, reminiscent in size of the wedding of Connie and Carlo; of course, now the mood is somber and respectful. ,4370
MICHAEL, MAMA, FREDO and HAGEN stand by the flowered platform which holds the ornate coffin. ,1
We cannot see the remains of Don Corleone. ,12300
BONASERA is nearby, ready to do service to the bereaved family. ,2
JOHNNY FONTANE, tears openly falling, takes his turn. ,1
CLEMENZA whispers into the ear of LAMPONE. LAMPONE immediately arranges for the members of the Five New York Families to pay their respects. ,4610
First CUNEO, then STRACHI and then ZALUCHI. Then PHILIP TATTAGLIA, who merely passes by the Coffin. ,14400
Then BARZINI in a black homburg, standing a long time. ,1
MICHAEL watches the scene. ,6
BARZINI crosses himself and passes on, immediately rejoined by his men. ,1
As BARZINI leaves, it seems as though everyone is fawning on him; perhaps asking for favors: But at any rate, it is clear from the doors opened for him, the cigars lit for him, that he is the new Capo di Capi--the place formerly held by Don Corleone. ,59
MICHAEL watches silently. ,10
He embraces and comforts her. ,10
EXT DAY: MALL (LATER) Later on the Mall; some people have left, although there are still hundreds of mourners. ,1
A young GIRL approaches TESSIO. She's about 18. ,1200

TESSIO No... ,1240
He finds him. ,190000
NERI is close by. ,22
TESSIO Barzini wants to arrange a meeting. ,20
Says we can straighten any of our problems out. ,36
MICHAEL looks at him. ,2650
Late day. ,275000
The hundreds of cars, limousines and flower cars line the stone wall that surrounds this Italian-Catholic cemetary in Queens Village. ,1
Hundreds of people stand in a cluster; others watch; take pictures, etc. ,1
MICHAEL stands with his family, his MOTHER...and TOM HAGEN. MICHAEL (softly) Christ, Tom; I needed more time with him. ,18700
I really needed him. ,60600
HAGEN Did he give you his politicians? ,1
MICHAEL Not all...I needed another four months and I would have had them all. (he looks at TOM) I guess you've figured it all out? ,42100
MICHAEL (nods) A week from tonight. ,1
In Brooklyn on Tessio's ground, where I'll be safe. ,5
HAGEN looks at him; understands. ,1
MICHAEL But after the Baptism. ,2
I've decided to stand as godfather to Connie's baby. ,2
They look up. ,1630000
He opens it, and we see in it, nearly folded, a New York City Policeman's uniform. ,3
He takes it out piece by piece, almost reverently. ,2
Then the badge, and the identification card; with his picture on it. ,2
Slowly, in the solitude of his room, he begins to dress. ,2
INT DAY: MICHAEL'S BEDROOM (1955) MICHAEL and KAY are getting dressed for the christening in their room. ,2
MICHAEL looks very well; very calm; KAY is beginning to take on a matronly look. ,3

ROCCO LAMPONE carefully disassembles a revolver; oils it, checks it, and puts it back together. ,2

Various relatives and friends are beginning to gather at the Church. ,3
They laugh and talk. ,63700

CONNIE holds the baby; the MONSIGNOR is speaking; KAY and MICHAEL stand side by side around the urn. ,70000
PRIEST (to MICHAEL) Do you pledge to guide and protect this child if he is left fatherless? ,5
Do you promise to shield him against the wickedness of the world? ,361000
MICHAEL Yes, I promise. ,8
EXT DAY: FIFTH AVE. NERI continues up the 55th St. and Fifth Avenue area. ,2
He continues until he is in front of Rockefeller Center. ,148000
On his side of the street, he spots a limousine waiting directly across from the main entrance of the building. ,3
Slowly he approaches the limo, and taps on its fender with his nightstick. ,3
NERI points to the "No Parking" sign. ,2
The DRIVER turns his head away. ,33300
NERI OK, wise guy, you wanna summons, or you wanna move? ,2
DRIVER (obviously a hood) You better check with your precinct. ,1780000
NERI Move it! The DRIVER takes a ten dollar bill, folds it deliberately, and hands it out the window, trying to put it under NERI's jacket. ,2
NERI backs up, letting the bill fall onto the street. ,1
EXT DAY: MOTEL BALCONY LAMPONE on the motel balcony spots a Cadillac pulling up. ,1
It parks. ,143000
Quickly, he returns into the room. ,1
INT DAY: HOTEL STAIRS (1955) CLEMENZA is climbing the back stairs of a large hotel. ,2
He rounds the corner, puffs a little, and then continues upward. ,1

Close on the PRIEST's fingers as he gently applies oil to the infant's ears and nostrils. ,2
PRIEST Ephetha...be opened...So you may perceive the fragrance of God's sweetness. ,1
EXT DAY: ROCKEFELLER CENTER (1955) The DRIVER of the limousine in front of Rockefeller Center is arguing with NERI. Now the DRIVER looks up. ,1560
WHAT HE SEES: TWO MEN in topcoats exit the building, through the revolving glass doors. ,2
NERI opens up fire, trapping BARZINI in the shattering glass doors. ,1790
The doors still rotate, moving the dead body of BARZINI within them. ,1
INT DAY: CHURCH In the Church--the VIEW on MICHAEL. The PRIEST hands him the infant. ,418000

They are riddled with gunfire. ,2
INT DAY: HOTEL STAIRS (1955) CLEMENZA, huffing and puffing, climbs the back stairs, with his package. ,4

He walks through some glass doors, and moves to an ornate elevator waiting shaft. ,4
The lights indicate the elevator has arrived. ,3
The doors open, and we see a surprised CUNEO standing with the dapper MOE GREENE. CLEMENZA fires into the small elevator with a shotgun. ,2
The PRIEST hands a lighted candle to MICHAEL. PRIEST I christen you Michael Francis Rizzi. ,99400
Flash bulbs go off. ,2680
Everyone is smiles, and crowds around MICHAEL, KAY, CONNIE...and CARLO. --------------------------------------FADE OUT---------- EXT DAY: CHURCH (1955) The christening party outside the Church. ,1
Four or five limousines have been waiting; now pull up to receive MAMA, CONNIE and the baby; and the others. ,2
Everyone is very happy; only MICHAEL seems aloof and grave. ,417000
As the fuss is going on, a car pulls up. ,2390000
LAMPONE gets out and works his way to MICHAEL. He whispers in his ear. ,1
This is the news MICHAEL has been waiting for. ,15300000
CONNIE holds the baby up to MICHAEL. CONNIE Kiss your Godfather. ,1
The infant turns its head, and MICHAEL uses that as an excuse to back away. ,1
MICHAEL Carlo...we've had a change in the plans. ,1
Mama, Connie, Kay and the kids will have to take the trip out to Vegas without us. ,1
CONNIE Oh Mike, it's our first vacation together. ,3
CARLO (anxious to please) Jesus, Connie...Sure, Mike... ,1
MICHAEL Go back to your house and wait for me... ,2
He kisses KAY. MICHAEL (to KAY) I'll just be a couple of days... ,1
People are guided to the correct limousines; they start to drive off. ,2
INT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN TESSIO sits in the Kitchen of the Main House on the Mall. ,2
HAGEN enters. ,739
HAGEN You'd better make your call to Barzini; Michael's ready. ,2
TESSIO nods; moves to the telephone and dials a number. ,4
TESSIO We're on our way to Brooklyn. ,2
He hangs up and smiles. ,8
TESSIO I hope Mike can get us a good deal tonight. ,3
HAGEN (gravely) I'm sure he will. ,2
EXT DAY: MALL (1955) The TWO MEN walk out onto the Mall, toward a car. ,1
He says for you two to go on ahead. ,5780
TESSIO (frowning) Hell, he can't do that. ,4
It screws up all my arrangements. ,32
THREE MORE BODYGUARDS appear around him. ,3
HAGEN (gently) I can't go with you either, Tessio. ,2
He flashes at the men surrounding him; for a moment he panics, and then he accepts it. ,2
TESSIO (after the pause) Tell Mike it was business...I always liked him. ,2
HAGEN He understands that. ,756
TESSIO looks at the men, and then pauses. ,3
TESSIO (softly) Tom, can you get me off the hook? ,3
For old times' sake? ,6670000
HAGEN I can't. ,46
HAGEN turns, and walks away from the group. ,1
Then about twenty paces away, he stops, and looks back. ,1
TESSIO is led into a waiting car. ,1
HAGEN looks away, and walks off. ,2
INT DAY: CARLO'S LIVING ROOM (1955) CARLO RIZZI is alone in his house, smoking, waiting rather nervously. ,1
He moves to the window and looks out. ,5
Excitedly, CARLO moves to the front door; opens it. ,21600
He wears a broad smile. ,30
CARLO Godfather! MICHAEL You have to answer for Santino. ,2
The smile on CARLO's face slowly fades, then, in a foolish attempt for safety, he slams the door in their faces and backs into the living room. ,1
INT DAY: CARLO'S LIVING ROOM (1955) The door opens, and the grim party enters. ,1
MICHAEL You fingered Sonny for the Barzini people. ,7
That little farce you played out with my sister. ,8
Did Barzini kid you that would fool a Corleone? ,9
CARLO (dignity) I swear I'm innocent. ,2
I swear on the head of my children, I'm innocent. ,7
Mike, don't do this to me, please Mike, don't do this to me! MICHAEL (quietly) Barzini is dead. ,5820000
So is Philip Tattaglia, so are Strachi, Cuneo and Moe Greene...I want to square all the family accounts tonight. ,2
So don't tell me you're innocent; admit what you did. ,10
CARLO is silent; he wants to talk but is terrified. ,2
MICHAEL (almost kindly) Don't be frightened. ,4
Do you think I'd make my sister a widow? ,15
Do you think I'd make your children fatherless? ,3
After all, I'm Godfather to your son. ,3
No, your punishment is that you're out of the family business. ,33500000
I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas--and I want you to stay there. ,9
I'll send Connie an allowance, that's all. ,6
But don't keep saying you're innocent; it insults my intelligence and makes me angry. ,5
Who approached you, Tattaglia or Barzini? ,413
CARLO (sees his way out) Barzini. ,2
MICHAEL (softly) Good, good. ,4
Leave now; there's a car waiting to take you to the airport. ,5
CARLO moves to the door; opens it. ,2
He looks back at MICHAEL, who reassures him. ,2
MICHAEL I'll call your wife and tell her what flight you're on. ,3
EXT DAY: MALL CARLO moves out to the Mall; the BUTTONMEN are putting his things in the trunk. ,1
ONE opens the front door for him. ,31400
SOMEONE is sitting in the rear seat, though we cannot see who. ,3
CARLO gets into the car; out of nervousness, he looks back to see the other man. ,2
It is CLEMENZA, who nods cordially. ,5
The motor starts, and as the car pulls away, CLEMENZA suddenly throws the garrote around CARLO's neck. ,1
He chokes and leaps up like a fish on a line, kicking his feet. ,2
The garrote is pulled tighter; CARLO's face turns color. ,3
His thrashing feet kick right through the front windshield. ,39300
Then the body goes slack. ,2
CLEMENZA makes a foul face, and opens the window as the car drives off. ,2
EXT DAY: CARLO'S STEPS (1955) MICHAEL and his party. ,2
They watch. ,792000
They do not speak for a long time; it is night--car lights flash by. ,3
NERI turns back. ,5
NERI You know I would never question anything you say. ,1
MICHAEL (smiles) Speak your mind. ,2
NERI I'll do this for you; you know I should. ,11700000
EXT NITE: PIZZA STREET (1955) MICHAEL's car pulls up in a quiet neighborhood, near an Italian Pizzeria. ,1
NERI opens the door. ,17
MICHAEL Sit in the car. ,3
INT NITE: PIZZA PLACE (1955) He walks alone into the restaurant. ,1
MICHAEL Where's the boss? ,1
MAN In the back. ,15700000
A MAN comes out of the shadows, with a strong Italian accent. ,4
MAN What is it? ,1530000
It is FABRIZZIO. VIEW ON MICHAEL. Gunfire from under his coat. ,1
FABRIZZIO is cut down. ,2
MICHAEL throws the gun down; turns and exits. ,2
INT DAY: DON'S LIVING ROOM (1955) Inside the Corleone house. ,4
Big boxes have been packed; furniture prepared for shipping. ,3
CONNIE Michael! She hurries into the living room, where she comes upon MICHAEL and KAY. KAY (comforting) Connie... ,1
But CONNIE avoids her, and moves directly to MICHAEL. NERI is watchful. ,1
CONNIE You lousy bastard; you killed my husband... ,4
KAY Connie... ,13200
CONNIE You waited until our father died and nobody could stop you and you killed him, you killed him! You blamed him about Sonny, you always did, everybody did. ,3
But you never thought about me, never gave a damn about me. (crying) What am I going to do now, what am I going to do. ,2
TWO of Michael's BODYGUARDS move closer, ready for orders from him. ,3
But he stands there, waiting for his sister to finish. ,1
KAY Connie, how could you say such things? ,2
CONNIE Why do you think he kept Carlo on the Mall? ,2
But he didn't dare while my father was alive. ,7
And then he stood Godfather to our child. ,12
That coldhearted bastard. (to KAY) And do you know how many men he had killed with Carlo? ,18700
Just read the papers. ,44
That's your husband. ,24
She tries to spit into MICHAEL's face; but in her hysteria she has no saliva. ,38500
MICHAEL Get her home and get a doctor. ,2
The TWO BODYGUARDS immediately take her arms and move her, gently but firmly. ,1
KAY is shocked; never taking her look of amazement from MICHAEL. He feels her look. ,2
MICHAEL She's hysterical. ,13
But KAY won't let him avoid her eyes. ,3
KAY Michael, it's not true. ,2
Please tell me. ,5420000
MICHAEL Don't ask me. ,6260
KAY Tell me! MICHAEL All right, this one time I'll let you ask about my affairs, one last time. ,2630000
KAY Is it true? ,2970
She looks directly into his eyes, he returns the look, so directly that we know he will tell the truth. ,6
MICHAEL (after a very long pause) No. KAY is relieved; she throws her arms around him, and hugs him. ,2
Then she kisses him. ,37800
KAY (through her tears) We both need a drink. ,1
INT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN (1955) She moves back into the kitchen and begins to prepare the drinks. ,1
He stands arrogantly at ease, weight resting on one foot slightly behind the other. ,2
One hand on his hip, like a Roman Emperor. ,1
The CAPOREGIMES stand before him. ,3
CLEMENZA takes MICHAEL's hand, kissing it. ,2
CLEMENZA Don Corleone... ,1020
The smile fades from KAY's face, as she looks at what her husband has become. ,2
INT DAY: CHURCH (1955) KAY wears a shawl over her hand. ,2
She drops many coins in the coin box, and lifts a burning taper, and one by one, in a pattern known only to herself, lights thirty candles. ,2

DANNY Good morning. ,1640
VOICE (O.S.) Please state your name for the record. ,4
DANNY Daniel Ocean. ,808
VOICE (O.S.) Thank you. ,16
Mr. Ocean, the purpose of this meeting is to determine whether, if released, you are likely to break the law again. ,7
While this was your first conviction, you have been implicated, though never charged, in over a dozen other confidence schemes and frauds. ,20
What can you tell us about this? ,321000
DANNY As you say, ma'am, I was never charged. 2 INT. PAROLE BOARD HEARING ROOM - WIDER VIEW - MORNING 2 Three PAROLE BOARD MEMBERS sit opposite Danny, behind a table. ,1
BOARD MEMBER #2 Mr. Ocean, what we're trying to find out is: was there a reason you chose to commit this crime, or was there a reason why you simply got caught this time? ,21900000
DANNY My wife left me. ,511
I was upset. ,363000
I got into a self-destructive pattern. (CONTINUED) OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 2. 2 CONTINUED: 2 BOARD MEMBER #3 If released, is it likely you would fall back into a similar pattern? ,7
DANNY She already left me once. ,428
I don't think she'll do it again just for kicks. ,9
Glances dart between the Board Members. ,580000
BOARD MEMBER #1 Mr. Ocean, what do you think you would do if released? ,57700000
Danny considers. ,2250
DANNY (deadpan) I don't know. ,5
How much do you guys make a year? 3 INT. MINIMUM-SECURITY PRISON - CHECK-OUT STATION - DAY 3 GUARD #2 Ocean, Daniel. ,1200
Danny steps forth, and GUARD #1 doles out his possessions and a form certifying their return to Danny. ,24900
GUARD #2 Sign. (adding a piece of mail to the pile) This came today for you. ,18400000
Rest'll be forwarded to your parole officer. ,9
GUARD #1 (reading its return address over Danny's shoulder) Those your lawyers? ,18600000
DANNY My wife's. ,6140
He opens the letter, and as his eyes gaze over the papers within, he smirks just a little. ,78900
GUARD #1 What's it say? (CONTINUED) OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 3. 3 CONTINUED: 3 DANNY I'm a free man. 4 INT. CHANGING CUBICLE 4 Danny pulls on civilian clothes and there's not a bare thread among them. ,20800000
He tugs his cuffs and smiles: The old skin feels good. ,5
One last item to don: a silver wedding band. ,2320000
Danny considers it. ,877
Will he put it on? 5 EXT. MINIMUM-SECURITY PRISON - FRONT GATE - AFTERNOON 5 A sign reads: "NEW JERSEY STATE MINIMUM-SECURITY CORRECTIONAL FACILITY." Someone has graffitied below it: "If you were in prison, you'd be home now." The great metal door opens, and Danny stands within its frame, ready for release. (If it matters -- and if you notice -- he's wearing his wedding ring.) He hovers there for a moment, on the precipice of freedom. ,60
The WIND WHISTLES a little on the other side of the gate, and the view ahead is not pleasant (New Jersey): Life is hard out there. ,1
But Danny musters his courage, then takes his first step into free America... ,1
A6 EXT. ATLANTIC CITY BOARDWALK - DUSK A6 Any empty wintery boardwalk. 6 INT. CASINO (ATLANTIC CITY) - NIGHT 6 ... ,1
And his wingtip lands squarely on plush red carpeting. ,4
He's home. ,2240000
He turns his attention back to his cards, and the cards of the dealer. ,3
Nine-ten. ,753000
Dealer -- seventeen. ,1320

Queen-ace. ,13600
Twenty-one. ,10400000
Danny wins again. ,224
DANNY Hello, Frank. ,2
The new dealer (FRANK CATTON) glances up at Danny, and his eyes go wide, like a priest who's discovered he's dealing communion wafers to the pontiff himself. ,1
He quickly hides his astonishment. ,4
FRANK I beg your pardon, sir. ,3
You must have me confused with someone else. ,8660
My name is Ramon. ,6390
See? ,31600000
He taps the name embroidered on his vest, although he is the most African-looking Ramon you've ever seen. ,1
A pit boss circles close by and glares at them both. ,181000
DANNY My mistake... (collecting his chips, doubled) Table's cold anyway. ,2
FRANK You might try the lounge at the Grand, sir. ,2
It gets busy around one. ,9
DANNY (as he goes) Thanks. 8 INT. LOUNGE AT GRAND 8 Danny checks his watch -- 12:58 -- then the lounge around him: prison had more nightlife. ,1
The first: Tan, well-coiffed developer and new owner of the Paradiso, Terry Benedict, with a beautiful (if barely visible) woman on his arm. ,1
The second: scowling former owner, Reuben Tishkoff. ,1
FRANK (O.S.) Catching up on current events? ,3
Danny lowers the paper; Frank is sitting across from him, changed out of his dealer's threads. ,40700
DANNY Ramon? ,3530
FRANK Glad to meet you. ,726
Frank Catton wouldn't get by the gaming board. (beat) You just out? ,3
DANNY This afternoon. ,1270
FRANK (re: Danny's drink and whereabouts) And already turning over a new leaf. ,3
Frank signals a passing waitress; she ignores him. ,3
DANNY (directly, this is why he's here) You seen him? ,1450000
FRANK Last I heard he was in L.A. ,5
Teaching movie stars how to play cards. (beat) Why? ,8
You don't have something planned already? ,20
DANNY You kidding? ,16
I just became a citizen again. ,24
FRANK Jesus... 9 INT. SUB SHOP - NIGHT 9 MOVING WITH Danny and Frank. ,1
FRANK It's tough now, our line of work. ,81600000
Everybody so serious. ,9660
Too many guns, too many computers. ,976000
Whadda you gonna do? ,1900
Steal from ordinary people? ,21
DANNY That would be criminal. ,5
FRANK So what's left? ,4
Banks? ,16300000
Hah. ,2860000
Banks got no money. ,8520000
It's all electronic. ,375000
Only place that still takes cash is... ,5
DANNY Casinos. ,9
FRANK (realizing) Oh, no... ,2
DANNY Oh, yes... ,1350
FRANK When? ,79500
DANNY Soon. ,6170
Interested? ,17800000
Frank smiles. ,3750
My name is Danny Ocean. ,16
I'm just out, I'm supposed to check in with you within twenty-four hours. (listens) No, sir, I haven't gotten into any trouble. ,1
No drinking, no sir. (listens, finishes his bourbon) No, sir, I wouldn't even think of leaving the state. ,1
OFF the sound of a JET fly-over we... ,4
CUT TO: A11 EXT. HOLLYWOOD CLUB (DEEP) - REAR ENTRANCE - NIGHT A11 PULLING OFF the Capitol Building, we PICK UP Rusty (tall, angular, ebony) leaning against his Ford Falcon. ,47
TOPHER (O.S.) Hey! Hey, Rusty! Rusty turns to the voice and -- CUT TO: ANOTHER ANGLE MOVING WITH him and Topher Grace, the actor, as they push down a back alley. ,665
TOPHER Hey, I don't know if you're, uh, you know, incorporated or anything, like Rusty Ryan. ,2
So he suggested that it'd be better if I wrote you a check, and thereby -- Rusty looks at him: are you stoned? ,2
TOPHER Or, or we could keep it cash. ,3
By this time, they should have entered -- 11 OMITTED 11 A12 INT. HOLLYWOOD CLUB (DEEP) - NIGHT A12 -- where they must weave through hordes of young Hollywood nightclubbers. ,1
RUSTY Alright. ,1940
Who's here? ,515000
TOPHER Josh is here. ,233000
Seth is here. ,10900
David couldn't make it. ,27700
He's got two weeks of reshoots on Lusitania because somebody just figured out forty percent of the budget is coming from Germany. ,2
RUSTY That's a problem. ,2
TOPHER Barry is here. ,3
RUSTY I thought they let him out to do that H.B.O. thing in Vancouver. ,2
TOPHER Couldn't work the dates. ,3
Oh, and he brought his girlfriend. (CONTINUED) OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 5/31/01 9. ,2
A12 CONTINUED: A12 RUSTY Not the one from -- TOPHER Uh-huh. ,1
RUSTY (beat) I quit watching when Kate left Don after his accident. ,3
They pass on, and into -- 12 OMITTED 12 A13 INT. BACK ROOM - NIGHT A13 Small but stylish. ,2
Rusty enters, Topher in tow. ,53400
RUSTY Good evening, guys. ,8
Let's play some cards... ,704000
RUSTY ... and let's play some cards. ,3
AT TABLE - LATER The group lesson has begun. ,3
TOPHER A hundred bucks to me... (mulling it over) Ah, what the hell. ,2
Pocket change. ,374000
Call. ,51000000
Rusty leans into Topher's ear, whispering: (CONTINUED) OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 5/31/01 10. ,2
A13 CONTINUED: A13 RUSTY Why you bet a certain way is your business. ,1
But you have to make them think you're betting for a reason. ,3
Understand? ,21300000
SAME SCENE - LATER To another player: RUSTY Seth. ,4
You know what you have. ,2920000
Looking at them doesn't change them. ,9
Leave 'em where they are and make your bet. ,5
SAME SCENE - LATER To another player: RUSTY You're showing. ,3
Yeah, I know she's your girlfriend, Barry, but you can't... ,2
SAME SCENE - LATER To another: RUSTY Josh. ,2
Deal to your left. ,7
SAME SCENE - LATER A WAITRESS enters from the club, and DANCE MUSIC with her. ,3
As she distributes a fresh round: WAITRESS One McCallum neat. ,3
And four bottled waters. ,15
Rusty takes in the sight -- bottled fucking water on a poker table. ,2
SETH (triumphantly) Two pair -- nines and twos. ,5
Rusty checks his hand: a full-house full of face cards. (CONTINUED) OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 5/31/01 11. ,2
A13 CONTINUED: (2) A13 RUSTY (folding) You got me. (as Seth rakes in his winnings) Let's take a little break. 13 OMITTED 13 A14 INT. HOLLYWOOD CLUB (DEEP) - NIGHT A14 At the bar, Rusty orders a double. ,28
He needs it. ,200000
BARTENDER (shouting over music) How's the game going?!! RUSTY It's been the longest hour of my life. ,3
BARTENDER What?! RUSTY (at the same volume) I'm running away with your wife. ,2
The Bartender, not able to hear him, smiles and flashes a thumbs-up before moving away. ,2
BARTENDER Cool, man! Behind the bar two go-go dancers writhe behind red-light- district windows, and Rusty catches his own fatigued expression in their reflection. ,1
Then, out the corner of his eye, he catches sight of a man passing through the pulsating crowd. ,2
Someone familiar to him. ,19
He follows. 14 OMITTED 14 A15 INT. HOLLYWOOD CLUB (DEEP) - BACK ROOM A15 Rusty returns. ,6010
TOPHER Hey, Rusty, we got another player, if that's alright. (CONTINUED) OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 5/31/01 12. ,1
A15 CONTINUED: A15 Topher indicates the new arrival: Danny. ,2
Rusty looks as if there's a bad smell in the room. ,2790000
RUSTY What's this? ,32
DANNY The bouncer mentioned there was a game in progress. ,5
I hope I'm not intruding. ,10900
TOPHER No intrusion at all -- RUSTY What was his name, the bouncer's? ,11600
DANNY I don't remember. ,1520000
RUSTY A card player with amnesia. ,11
This should be fun. ,180000
AT TABLE - MOMENTS LATER Rusty deals the next hand. ,2
TOPHER What do you do for a living, Mr. Ocean? ,2
If you don't mind my asking. ,70000
DANNY Why should I mind? ,5360000
Two cards, please... (long beat) I just got out of prison. ,2
TOPHER Really? (a glance among the other players) Really... ,3
RUSTY (half to divert attention) Barry, you're showing again. ,1
BARRY (O.S.) Sorry. (CONTINUED) OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 5/31/01 12A. ,2
A15 CONTINUED: (2) A15 JOSH What'd you, uh, go to prison for? ,2
DANNY I stole things. ,30
JOSH What, like jewels? ,3
Diamonds? ,14800000
A beat, then: RUSTY Incan matrimonial headmasks. ,12500
Looks are exchanged. ,1850
Everyone digests that. ,46
JOSH From a museum? ,1
DANNY Gallery. ,3610
SETH There a lot of money in those? ,4
Incan matrimonial... ,1080
DANNY Headmasks. ,23
Some. ,48000000
RUSTY Don't let him fool you, Seth. ,2
There's boatloads. ,1710
If you can move the things... (finishing his deal) One card to me. (to Danny, pointedly) ... but you can't. ,1
DANNY My fence seemed confident enough. ,29
RUSTY If you're dealing with cash, you don't need a fence. ,1
DANNY Some people just lack vision. ,3
RUSTY Probably everybody in cell block E. (CONTINUED) OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 5/31/01 12B. ,2
A15 CONTINUED: (3) A15 Now the other players realize. ,2
And, judging from their steely glares across the table, not a happy one. ,2
DANNY Well, that's all behind us now. ,2
RUSTY I should hope so. ,5
Danny smiles, icily -- of course, it's not -- then pulls out his wallet. ,1
DANNY I raise you five hundred dollars. ,5
A hush in the room. ,12800000
Danny has thrown down the gauntlet. ,10
He and Rusty hold each other's stares. ,4
RUSTY Guys: Day One: what's the first rule of poker? ,5
BARRY TOPHER Um, never bet on, uh, on 'Leave emotion at the a -- door.' RUSTY That's right. ,2
My friend here just raised me out of pique. (beat) Today's lesson. ,1
How to draw out a bluff. ,4
This early in the game, that much money, I'm thinking he's holding nothing better than a pair of face cards. (beat) Seth, raise him. ,1
SETH Okay. ,2620
Uh, your five hundred and... another two? ,7
Rusty nods, and Seth pushes in his chips. ,4
RUSTY Tophe... ,4
TOPHER Seven to me. ,3
Plus three. ,658000
What the hell. (CONTINUED) OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 5/31/01 12C. ,2
A15 CONTINUED: (4) A15 RUSTY Indeed. ,2
But be careful you don't push him too high too fast. ,8
I call. ,13200000
It's Josh's turn. ,21600
He hesitates... ,60000
JOSH What's that to me? ,1
A thousand? ,13900000
RUSTY All you have to do is call. ,5
DANNY (off Josh's further hesitation) What? ,10
Your girlfriend holding your purse? ,4
That does it. ,7530000
Josh is in. ,217000
The bet's to Danny. ,4
He checks his hand, and Seth starts to whisper to Topher. ,2
DANNY Contrary to what Mr. Ryan may say, Seth, I always check my cards before I make a bet. ,1
But be cafeful. ,1660
I could tell from your face you're holding three of a kind or better. (digging his wallet out) Five hundred to call. ,1
And two grand more. ,8
Danny stares Rusty down. ,8
The others look a little pale. ,1480000
RUSTY Guys, you're free to do what you like. ,2
It's a lot of money. ,6
But I'm staying in. ,51
He's trying to buy his way out of his bluff. ,29
Nobody looks too eager to call, but nobody wants to leave a grand on the table, either. ,1
Finally, Seth ponies up, and the others -- not be outdone -- do, too. ,1
RUSTY We call. ,21
Danny sets down his hand. ,756000
Four nines. ,36500
It's a winner. ,2320000
The others, jaws dropped, throw in their cards. ,324000
For the first time tonight, Rusty blanches. (CONTINUED) OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 5/31/01 12D. ,2
A15 CONTINUED: (5) A15 RUSTY Shit. ,2
Sorry, guys. ,461000
I -- I was sure he was bluffing. ,5
As Rusty plummets in the estimation of all the guys around him, Danny rakes in his pot. ,1
DANNY Thanks for the game, fellas. (then) Hey, I hate to ask this, but could you sign something for me? ,1
RUSTY That was, that was just... ,2
DANNY Unprofessional. ,6
Rusty agrees. ,1130
RUSTY How was the clink? ,33
You get the cookies I sent you? ,59400
DANNY Why do you think I came to see you first? ,884
Danny pulls out a wad of bills from his jacket, peels off half, and hands it to Rusty. ,10700
DANNY Ten grand. ,3
DANNY I've got something better for you. 17 INT. CANTER'S DELI - NIGHT 17 They're sitting in a booth over coffee. ,1
RUSTY How's Tess? ,6340000
Danny stares at him: next subject, please. ,2
RUSTY Alright. ,2060
DANNY It's tricky. ,9
No one's ever done it before. ,28800
Needs planning, a large crew. ,5
RUSTY Guns? ,8940
DANNY Not loaded ones. ,12
It has to be very precise. ,318000
There's a lot of security. ,7
But the take... ,343000
RUSTY What's the target? ,7
DANNY Eight figures each. ,12
RUSTY What's. ,16400
The. ,122000000
Target. (CONTINUED) 13. 17 CONTINUED: 17 DANNY (deep breath, then) When's the last time you were in Vegas? ,1
RUSTY What? ,18300
You wanna knock over a casino? ,12
Danny puts down his coffee. ,7
And shakes his head. ,103000
And lifts three fingers: three casinos. ,4
Rusty must put down his coffee, too. 18 EXT. DOWNTOWN L.A. - NIGHT 18 It's after hours downtown. ,1
Dark, empty, dead... 19 INT. LIBRARY TOWER - 40TH FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT 19 Lights out on the 40th. ,2
Engraved brass announces: J.A. ,13300
KUEHN & ASSOCIATES, ARCHITECTS. Two flashlight beams strafe wood-paneled, elegant offices: Danny and Rusty on late-night reconnaissance. ,1120000
As Danny prowls a cabinet full of blueprints, Rusty passes the time switching papers from a desk's in box to its out box. ,1
At last, Danny finds the right set of blueprints and drapes it across the desk; we, however, never see it. ,1
DANNY The vault at the Bellagio. ,11
A beat as Rusty scans the document, then another underneath it. ,2
RUSTY If I'm reading these right -- and I think that I am -- this is probably the least accessible vault ever designed. (beat) Oops. ,1
Actually, you know what, I'm wrong. ,2
It's definitely the least accessible vault ever designed. ,36200
DANNY Yep. ,2350
Rusty's brow furrows just a little. (CONTINUED) OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 14. 19 CONTINUED: 19 RUSTY You said three casinos... ,2
DANNY (flips to next blueprint) These feed into the cages at both the Mirage and the M.G.M. ,1
Grand. (tapping vault) But every dime ends up here. ,2
RUSTY The Bellagio, Mirage, and... ,3
These are Terry Benedict's places. ,653
DANNY Yes, they are. ,3400
Think he'll mind? ,7250
RUSTY More than somewhat. 20 AT 40TH FLOOR ELEVATOR BAY 20 No ding. ,2
The elevator just arrives. ,17
RUSTY You'd need at least a dozen guys, doing a combination of cons. ,78
DANNY Like what, you think? ,10
RUSTY Well, off the top of my head, I'd say you're looking at a Boesky, a Jim Brown, a Miss Daisy, two Jethros, and a Leon Spinks. ,5
Terry Benedict has a list of enemies. ,454000
RUSTY But does he have enemies with loose cash and nothing to lose... (smiles, realizing) Aha. ,2
DANNY (smiles, too) Aha. ,1
RUSTY Reuben. 22 MOVING WITH SECURITY GUARD 22 as he approaches Danny's and Rusty's voices... 23 BACK WITH DANNY AND RUSTY 23 DANNY So... ,1
RUSTY So, here's what I think: You should take this plan, kick it around for a week or two. ,3
Sleep on it. ,917000
Turn it over in your head. ,10
Then: never bring it up to me again. ,2
DANNY Uh-huh. ,872
So what are you saying? ,411000
RUSTY I'm saying: this is like trying to build a house of cards on the deck of a speeding boat. ,4
DANNY Really? ,12300
I thought it was much harder than that -- Suddenly the Security Guard's flashlight beam hits them square in the eyes. ,3
Danny and Rusty put their hands up to block the light. ,2
DANNY Jesus, Oscar, lower it a little, will ya? (CONTINUED) OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 16. 23 CONTINUED: 23 SECURITY GUARD Sorry. (lowers beam) You two done up here? ,2
Find what you wanted? ,568000
DANNY Yeah, thanks. ,1020
You mind if we borrow a couple drawings for the night? ,4
Make some copies. ,16800
Danny withdraws his money clip, peels off a couple hundreds, and buries them in the Security Guard's hand. ,1
DANNY 'Preciate it. 24 AT 40TH FLOOR ELEVATOR BAY 24 Danny and Rusty wait for an elevator. ,2
When its doors open, Rusty stops Danny from boarding. ,1
RUSTY I need a reason. ,6
And don't say money. (beat) Why do this? ,2
DANNY Why not do it? ,1390
Rusty stares at him: enough bullshitting around. ,404000
DANNY Because yesterday I walked out of the joint wearing my entire wardrobe and you're colddecking TeenBeat coverboys. (beat) Because the house always wins. ,1
You play long enough, never changing stakes, the house takes you. ,115
Unless, when that special hand comes around, you bet big. ,32
And then you take the house. ,1
Rusty smiles. (CONTINUED) 17. 24 CONTINUED: 24 RUSTY You're been practicing that speech, haven't you? ,1
DANNY A little. ,82600
Did I rush it? ,32
It felt like I rushed it. ,6
RUSTY No, it was good. ,41
They step aboard the elevator. ,2
As the door closes: RUSTY I wonder what Reuben will say? ,112000
Danny and Rusty look at each other. ,9
TISHKOFF Are you listening to me? ,5
You are, both of you, nuts. ,39900
I know more about casino security than any man alive. ,68
I invented it, and it cannot be beaten. ,1090
They got cameras, they got watchers, they got locks, they got timers, they got vaults. ,5290000
They got enough armed personnel to occupy Paris. ,89
Okay, bad example... ,3190
DANNY It's never been tried. ,27
TISHKOFF Oh, it's been tried. ,601000
A few guys even came close. ,22400
TISHKOFF (V.O.) Number three. ,3
The bronze medal. ,358000
Pencilneck grabs a lockbox at the Sands. ,5
He got two steps closer to the door than any living soul before him. ,985
TISHKOFF (V.O.) Second most successful robbery. ,3
The Flamingo '71. ,39
This guy actually smelled fresh oxygen before they got him. ,6
RESUME ACTION: The billy club comes down -- whap! -- across the hippie's skull and it's Chicago '68 all over again. ,2
He came, he grabbed, he got conquered. ,10
You guys are pros, the best. ,208000
I'm sure you can make it out of the casino. ,19
Of course, lest we forget, once you're out the front door, you're still in the middle of the fucking desert! Both Danny and Rusty look chastened. ,2
RUSTY You're right. (to Danny) He's right. ,3
DANNY Reuben, you're right. ,5
Our eyes are bigger than our stomachs. ,4460
RUSTY That's exactly it. ,10
Pure ego. ,10200
TISHKOFF Yeah yeah blah blah. ,14
DANNY Thank you so much for setting us straight. ,4
Sorry we bothered you. ,885000
They both rise to go. ,317000
TISHKOFF Look, we all go way back. ,12
I owe you from that thing with the guy in the place, and I'll never forget it. ,8
DANNY It was our pleasure. ,31
RUSTY I'd never been to Belize. (CONTINUED) 20. 30 CONTINUED: 30 TISHKOFF Give Dominic your addresses, I got some remaindered furniture I wanna send you. ,1
Danny and Rusty begin to circle the pool to leave. ,5
Tishkoff, of course, won't let them go that easily. ,3
TISHKOFF Just out of curiosity, which casinos did you geniuses pick to rob? ,3
Danny stops, almost as if he's been waiting for this question, which of course he has. ,3
DANNY The Bellagio, Mirage, and the M.G.M. ,6
TISHKOFF (nostrils flared, smelling a rat) Those are Terry Benedict's casinos. ,9
RUSTY Say, you know, he's right. ,4
Tishkoff waves them back, sipping on his umbrellaed cocktail. ,2
TISHKOFF You guys... ,20
Whadda you got against Terry Benedict? ,15
DANNY What do you have against him? ,7
That's the real question. ,290000
TISHKOFF He torpedoed my casino, muscled me out, now he's gonna blow it up next month to make way for another fuckin' eyesore. ,2
Don't think I don't see what you're doin'. ,1
RUSTY What are we doing, Reuben? (CONTINUED) OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 21. 30 CONTINUED: (2) 30 TISHKOFF You gonna steal from Terry Benedict, you better goddamn know. ,1
This sorta thing used to be civilized. ,51
You'd hit a guy, he'd whack you. ,924
Done. ,22800000
But Benedict... (bristles) At the end of this he better not know you're involved, not know your names, or think you're dead. ,2
Because he'll kill you, and then he'll go to work on you. ,9
DANNY That's why we've got to be very careful. ,5390000
We have to be precise. ,191000000
TISHKOFF Yeah, you gotta be nuts, too. ,5
And you're gonna need a crew as nuts as you are. (pregnant silence) Who do you have in mind? ,65300
Danny and Rusty both smile; they've hooked their fish. ,4
And so it begins... ,458000
RUSTY (V.O.) Alright. ,2
Who's in? ,8990000
DANNY (V.O.) Frank C. is in. 31 INT. CASINO OFFICE (ATLANTIC CITY) 31 Frank Catton coughs mightily into a handkerchief. ,1
Across a desk, his boss fills out paperwork. ,1
He stops to light a cigarette, inhales with deep satisfaction before a banner: "WELCOME TO LAS VEGAS." DANNY (V.O.) What about drivers? ,2
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 22. 33 EXT. VACANT, WEEDY DRAG RACETRACK - DAY 33 CLOSE ON a souped-up tractor-wheeled monster truck, its ENGINE ROARING before a starting line, itching to cross it. ,6
Now take a step back... ,45900
That souped-up monster truck stands a foot-and-a-half off the ground and sprouts an antenna from its back bumper. ,3
It's a remote-controlled toy. ,7
The ROARING ENGINE comes from the vehicle next to it: an actual monster truck. ,117000
Both vehicles peer down the track at a finish line a hundred yards away. ,4
This is a race. ,1090000
The drivers stare each other down: TURK (behind the wheel of the truck) and VIRGIL (track-side, remote control in hand) MALLOY. They're nice boys. ,2
Really. ,18900000
Peckerwoods, sure, but nice. ,4
RUSTY (V.O.) I talked to the Malloys yesterday. ,3
DANNY (V.O.) The Mormon twins? ,4
RUSTY (V.O.) They're both in Salt Lake City, six months off the job. ,3
I got the sense they're having trouble filling the hours. ,10
Lights flash red-to-yellow-to-green and while the TRUCK COATS RUBBER on the track, Virgil's toy zips to a lead. ,2
It's looking to be an embarrassment for Turk until he jerks his wheel a little and -- ka-thunk -- flattens his brother's vehicle. ,1780
Virgil pouts as he plucks up the wreckage of his entry. ,4
DANNY (V.O.) Electronics? ,6
Little do they know... ... ,198000
LIVINGSTON DELL, audio-visual junkie, and victim of a continual flop sweat, crouches before their image, masterfully controlling his surveillance camera with a joystick in his left hand. ,1
He is flanked by FBI MEN. (CONTINUED) OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 23. 34 CONTINUED: 34 RUSTY (V.O.) Livingston's been doing freelance surveillance work of late for the F.B.I. ,54
Mob Squad. ,61300
DANNY (V.O.) How are his nerves? ,2
RUSTY (V.O.) Okay. (beat) Not so bad you'd notice. ,2
As a FBI Man reaches to adjust a monitor... ,5
LIVINGSTON D-don't, don't-don't... touch... it. ,2
FBI MAN #1 What? ,4160000
LIVINGSTON Do you see me pulling the gun out of your holster and firing it? ,4
FBI MAN #2 Hey, Radio Shack: relax. 35 EXT. SANTA MONICA BOARDWALK - LATER 35 Livingston walks down the boardwalk. ,4170000
A rollerblader with a dog on a leash approaches and Livingston gets caught between the two. ,3
As he struggles to untangle himself from the leash... 36 INT. CAFE 36 With a view of Livingston on the boardwalk... ,1
Danny and Rusty wait for him over espressos. ,2

RUSTY Dead. (CONTINUED) OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 23A. 36 CONTINUED: 36 DANNY No shit? ,2
On the job? ,8660000
RUSTY Sun cancer. ,8
DANNY You send flowers? ,1290000
RUSTY Dated his wife a while. ,4
A pair of goggles over his eyes reflects a match being struck, then touched to a fuse. ,1
BASHER Sweet... ,270
BANG! Wood shards and SPLINTERS of GLASS fly all around; Basher merely ducks his head and whistles. ,2
As the dust settles, three men move quickly past Basher and into (what the settling fog now reveals to be) a dynamited bank vault. ,1
ALARMS begin to sound: this is bad news. ,3
An explosives COP kneels in front of him. (CONTINUED) OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 25. 39 CONTINUED: 39 COP And that's all you used during the event? ,1
Nothing else? ,8930000
BASHER Are you accusing me of booby- trapping? ,2
COP Well, how 'bout it? ,2
VOICE (O.S.) Booby traps aren't Mr. Tarr's style. ,2
The Cop turns; standing behind him, stone-faced, is Rusty, in a dark suit and shades. ,12100
RUSTY Isn't that right, Basher? ,2
BASHER That's right. ,8
RUSTY (flashing badge, briefly) Peck, A.T.F. ,2
Let me venture a guess. ,12000
A simple G4 mainliner, double-coil, backwound, quick fuse with a drag under 20 feet. (off Cop's reaction) That's our man. ,1
Tell me something else. ,1650000
Have you checked him for booby traps on his person? ,6
I mean really checked, not just for weapons... ,5
The Cop looks bewildered. ,7
Rusty steps forward, yanks Basher onto his feet, spins him around. ,2
He moves his hands up and down Basher's legs, around his waist, under his arms. ,2
RUSTY Will you go find Griggs and tell him I need to see him? ,4
BASHER Done. ,1280
Thirty seconds all right? ,1
RUSTY From when? ,5880
RUSTY Ten seconds? ,4
BASHER Not quite. ,18
Is Danny here? ,51400000
RUSTY Around the corner. ,11
BASHER Be good working with professionals again. (beat) Okay: go. ,2440000
And they both start running. ,3440
RUSTY Everyone down! Get down! There's a bomb in the... ,1
And behind them the SQUAD CAR ERUPTS with a BANG! A collective SCREAM rises from the crowd, everyone ducks, cops hit the ground and cover their heads. ,2
Rusty and Basher move briskly past them, dodging their splayed legs like tires on an obstacle course. ,1
By the time the Explosives Cop thinks to look around for Basher, they've both disappeared. ,1
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 27. 41 OMITTED 41 42 INT. UNDER BIG TOP - DAY 42 The Chinese National Circus, currently on tour in the Western United States. ,4720
Trapeze artists, gymnastic teams, and trampoline daredevils fly, somersault, spin, and swing through the air. ,95

Danny and Rusty sit in the bleachers, surrounded by parents and kids munching on spindles of cotton candy. ,1
Tough guys in toyland. ,2
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) (in Chinese, then English) Ladies and gentlemen: the amazing Yen. ,1
A funambulist (YEN) begins his high-wire act... ,4
DANNY So he can walk on a rope. ,3
RUSTY More than that. ,1350
DANNY So he can juggle. ,8
We need a grease man, not an acrobat. ,5
Who else is on the list? ,211000
RUSTY He is the list. (CONTINUED) OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 28. 42 CONTINUED: 42 DANNY Who else? ,1
RUSTY Watch. ,12100
Halfway across the wire, the funambulist sits. ,4
And very slowly, but without hesitation, he contorts himself into a ball, never losing his balance. ,18000
Even Danny is impressed. ,11
RUSTY There's your grease man. 43 EXT. SANTA MONICA PIER PARKING LOT - DAY 43 Danny and Rusty exit the circus tent, head for their car. ,2
DANNY We need Saul. ,6
RUSTY He won't come. ,2
He swore off the game a year ago. ,6
DANNY He get religion? ,1440000
RUSTY Ulcers. ,379
DANNY You can ask him. ,5
He checks his tickets, plunges them into his pants pocket, and moves off... 45 THROUGH TRACK LOBBY 45 Rusty appears in the f.g. behind a pillar, as dapper as Saul is down-at-heel, watching him go. ,3710
When Saul disappears into the tunnel, he moves. 46 IN INFIELD 46 Saul sits on one of the long, general admission steps under the box seats. ,1
He produces an orange from his pocket, starts to peel it. ,1
A pair of well-shined shoes appears behind him. ,4
Saul senses their presence, but doesn't turn around. ,1
SAUL I saw you in the paddock before the second race, outside the men's room, when I placed my bet. ,1
I saw you before you even got up this morning. ,16
RUSTY How ya been, Saul? ,5
SAUL Never better. ,33
RUSTY What's with the orange? ,41
SAUL My doctor says I need vitamins. ,37
RUSTY So why don't you take vitamins? ,39
For the first time, Saul cranes his neck and shoots a look up at Rusty. (CONTINUED) 30. 46 CONTINUED: 46 SAUL You come here to give me a physical? ,1
RUSTY I got a box seat. ,3
Come on. 47 EXT. BOX SEATS - LATER 47 A waiter serves coffee to Rusty and Saul. ,2
RUSTY I thought you drank bloody Mary's at the track, Saul. ,1
SAUL A man shouldn't drink on the job. ,4
RUSTY (re: race) Who we rooting for here? ,5
SAUL Number four. ,3
There's the BELL; the electronic rabbit is released and the dogs break out of the gate. ,149000
From this point on Saul's eyes never leave the race. ,3
SAUL You gonna ask me? ,5
Or should I just say no and get it over with? ,5
RUSTY Saul, you're the best there is. ,28
You're in Cooperstown. ,34
What do you want? ,7610000
SAUL Nothin'. ,15
I got a duplex now, I got wall-to-wall and a goldfish, I'm seeing a nice lady, she works the unmentionables counter at Macy's. ,4
I've changed. ,765000
RUSTY Guys like us don't change, Saul. ,29
We stay sharp or we get sloppy, but we don't change. ,11
SAUL Quit connin' me. (CONTINUED) 31. 47 CONTINUED: 47 They watch the race. ,2
RUSTY That your hound way in the back there? ,3
SAUL He breaks late. ,9
Everyone knows this. ,128000
On the track: The dogs are now coming around the back stretch, and the crowd on the bleachers rises, cheering. ,3
SAUL You gonna treat me like a grownup at least? ,3
Tell me what the scam is? ,10
Under the noise: Rusty leans in and whispers in Saul's ear. ,4
Saul's eyes widen, then glaze over as all around him people are standing and shouting. ,1
Rusty places an envelope in Saul's lap, then gets up and walks out as, on the track, the #4 dog crosses the finish line... last by several lengths. ,795
Saul considers his options. ,11
In one hand: a fan of losing tickets. ,5
In the other (courtesy of Rusty): a ticket to Las Vegas. ,3
DANNY (V.O.) And Saul makes ten. 48 INT. BAR - NIGHT 48 Danny and Rusty look weary from all this recruitment. ,2
A nearby TV with the sound off plays a promo for an upcoming Tyson fight. ,2
DANNY Ten should do it, don't you think? (as Rusty shrugs) You think we need one more? (as Rusty shrugs) You think we need one more. (as Rusty shrugs) Okay. ,2
From halfway down the train car, nothing appears amiss, and no passenger looks the wiser. ,3
Or so it seems... ,976000
A copy of the Chicago Sun-Times, opened and upheld, lowers just enough to allow its reader a peek at Linus. ,3
It is Danny, smirk on his lips: He (and he alone) is aware of the ongoing heist. ,2
LINUS Sorry 'bout that. ,6
STOCKBROKER No problem, guy. ,4
The Stockbroker resumes his yacketing, oblivious, as Linus tucks his prize into his own jacket pocket, face betraying nothing. ,2
Only Danny appreciates the artistry performed here today. ,4
He folds the Sun-Times under his arm as... 50 INT. UNION STATION - SUBWAY STATION 50 ... ,2
The SUBWAY SQUEALS to a stop. ,10
And his face falls. ,7210
All he finds where the stolen wallet once resided is a calling card. ,6
On one side, in engraved printing: "DANIEL OCEAN." On the flip side, in handwriting: "Nice pull. ,3
Murphy's Bar, Rush & Division." 53 INT. MURPHY'S BAR - FIVE MINUTES LATER 53 On a tabletop: the Gucci wallet beside a half-drunk Guinness. ,187000
Linus enters the front door, cases the joint, spots the wallet on the table, and Danny behind it. ,2
DANNY Hi, Linus. ,1
Sit down. ,11500000
LINUS Who are you? ,40
DANNY A friend of Bobby Caldwell's. ,27
Sit down. ,11600000
Linus balks, prideful, but sense finds a way, and he sits. ,1
DANNY Bobby told me about you. ,4
Said you were the best set of hands he ever saw. ,4
Didn't expect to find you working wallets on the subway. ,100000
LINUS That wasn't work, that was practice. ,2
Danny reaches into his jacket and sets a plane ticket on the table. ,2
He keeps his hand over it. (CONTINUED) 34. 53 CONTINUED: 53 DANNY You're either in or out, right now. ,2
LINUS What is it? ,3670
DANNY A plane ticket. ,11
A job offer. ,4410000
LINUS You're pretty trusting pretty fast. ,32
DANNY Bobby has every faith in you. ,4
LINUS Fathers are like that. (off Danny's reaction) He didn't tell you? (as Danny shakes his head) He doesn't like me trading on his name. ,2
DANNY You do this job, he'll be trading on yours. ,2
LINUS What if I say no? ,2
DANNY We'll get someone else who won't be quite as good. ,3
You can go back to feeling up stockbrokers. ,34
Linus considers. ,1050
He looks down at the ticket, then at the wallet. ,4
It's one or the other. ,2480000
A waitress passes, and Danny signals her for his bill. ,2
When his attention returns to Linus, the wallet remains... but the ticket beneath his hand is gone. ,2
Linus is reading it. ,1
DANNY That's the best lift I've seen you make yet. ,2
LINUS Las Vegas, huh? (CONTINUED) OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 35. 53 CONTINUED: (2) 53 DANNY America's playground. ,1
And our MAIN THEME KICKS IN as we... ,3
CUT TO: 54 LAS VEGAS - AERIAL VIEW - ESTABLISHING - DUSK 54 The city looms out of the desert like an infernal machine, lights flashing, skyline pulsing, a neon fortress. ,1
One thing in particular catches our eye: an enormous billboard with an ad for the upcoming boxing match between Mike Tyson and Lennox Lewis. ,2
LIVINGSTON Trick or treat. ... ,26
Livingston, Basher, Yen, the Malloys, Saul and Linus crowding his doormat. ,1
A taxi-van pulls away behind them. ,3
TURK You should. ,2550
You'd like it. ,1800000
You'd like Provo. ,24
VIRGIL (scarfing a jumbo shrimp) Anybody see the salsa goes with this? ,1
In a corner, off on his own, Linus watches the company, his eyes narrowing, wary. ,1
DANNY (O.S.) Gentlemen: welcome to Las Vegas. ,1
He starts down... ,5680
DANNY Everybody eaten? ,3
Everybody sober? ,1470
Close enough. ,1470000
Most of you know each other already. ,89600000
Linus trades nods around the room. ,3
DANNY Okay. ,4390
Before we start, nobody's on the line here yet. ,10
What I'm about to propose to you happens to be both highly lucrative and highly dangerous. ,9
If that doesn't sound like your particular brand of vodka, help yourself to as much food as you like and safe journey. ,12
No hard feelings. (pauses, soberly) Otherwise, come with me. ,1
And he follows, along with Frank and Livingston. ,6
Then Virgil, Turk and Yen. ,7
Then Saul. ,40200
That leaves Linus, watching the line of men disappear. ,6
He turns to find Tishkoff by his side, staring at him. ,3
LINUS Hi. TISHKOFF You're Bobby Caldwell's kid, huh? ,2
LINUS Yeah. ,11100
TISHKOFF From Chicago? ,3
LINUS Yeah. ,3600
TISHKOFF It's nice there. ,3
You like it? ,7650000
LINUS Yeah. ,3570
TISHKOFF That's wonderful. ,8
Get in the goddamn room. 58 INT. GAME ROOM 58 A tournament-level pool table holds center stage here. ,1720
Atop its green felt sits a raised, elaborate miniature of Terry Benedict's Las Vegas: three casinos and hotels with the Strip running between them. ,2
As the eleven surround the table and the model... ,2
DANNY Gentlemen: the 14000 block of Las Vegas Boulevard. ,274000
Otherwise known as the Bellagio, the Mirage, the M.G.M. ,6
Together, they're the three most profitable casinos in Las Vegas... (CONTINUED) OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 38. 58 CONTINUED: 58 Danny removes the Strip from the model. ,1
Revealed beneath is a complex substructure, featuring three tunnels, each leading from a casino to a single freight-sized elevator shaft which descends into an enormous vault. ,3
DANNY Gentlemen: the Bellagio vault. ,2
Located below the Strip, beneath two hundred feet of solid earth. ,9
It safeguards every dime that comes through each of the three casinos above it. (beat) And we're going to rob it. ,25300
Everyone takes a breath, awed. ,2
LINUS Smash-and-grab job, huh? ,152
RUSTY It's a little more complicated than that. ,3
Danny picks up a remote control and flips on a panel of Tvs. ,2
DANNY Courtesy of Frank Catton, new blackjack dealer at the Bellagio, security tapes from the three casinos. ,2
Bad news first. ,130000
This place houses a security system which rivals most nuclear missile silos. ,9
First: we have to get within the casino cages -- RUSTY (indicating) -- here, here, and here -- DANNY -- which anyone knows takes more than a smile. ,3
Next: through these doors, each of which requires a different six-digit code changed every twelve hours. ,11
DANNY Furthermore, the elevator shaft is rigged with motion detectors -- RUSTY -- meaning if we manually override the lift, the shaft's exit will lock down automatically and we'll be trapped. ,5
DANNY Once we've gotten down the shaft, though, then it's a walk in the park: just three more guards with Uzis and predilections toward not being robbed, and the most elaborate vault door conceived by man. ,1250
For a moment, each man keeps his two dozen questions or more to himself. ,86000
At last, one speaks up... ,4
The Amazing Yen. ,1720
In Cantonese. ,606000
Except Rusty. ,4200
RUSTY (in response) No. Tunneling is out. ,1
There are Richter scales monitoring the ground for one hundred yards in every direction. ,8
If a groundhog tried to nest there, they'd know about it. ,1130000
Anyone else? ,12100000
Another silence. ,16900
Either the guys are too dumbfounded by that bilingual exchange or too numbed by the task ahead of them to speak. ,1
TURK You said something about good news... ,153000
As I mentioned, this vault services each of the three casinos above it. ,7
That means: during the week, by law, it must hold anywhere from sixty to seventy million dollars in cash and coin. ,4
On a weekend, between eighty and ninety million. ,7
On a fight night, like the one two weeks from tonight, the night we're going to rob it, at least a hundred and fifty million. ,4
Each with an equal share. ,10300
You do the math. ,3370000
He whistles. ,19500
RUSTY Without being seen by the cameras. ,455
DANNY (off everyone's astonishment) Oh, right. ,3
I forgot to mention that. ,213000
SAUL Say we do all that. ,20900000
We're just supposed to walk outta there with a hundred million dollars in cash on us without getting stopped? ,6
Danny smiles, his broad, sure-of-himself grin, the one Rusty couldn't deny earlier and these guys won't deny now. ,1
DANNY Yeah. ,7820
DANNY Alright. ,2390
I want to know everything that's going on in all three casinos. ,9
I wanna know where they're from, what their nicknames are, how they take their coffee... ,109000
They were built as labyrinths, to keep people in. ,4
I want you guys to know the quick routes out. ,11
On the night of the fight, we're gonna throw the switch on sin city. ,36
Basher, it's your show. ,41
Casino security has an eye and ear on everything, so we'll want an eye and ear on them. ,1
Danny and Livingston study it. ,900000
I don't suppose they have a closed-circuit feed I could tap into? (CONTINUED) 46. 65 CONTINUED: 65 Danny shakes his head: no such luck. ,628
Do they employ an in- house technician? ,5
RUSTY Two. ,6800
And one of them is lonely. ,1
DANCER I'll be right back, honey. ,3880000
Don't move a muscle. ,73700
TECHNICIAN (drunk and in love) Depends on the muscle. ,348000
RUSTY Thanks, Charmaine. ,1
She'll be onstage in five minutes. 47. 68 INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - NIGHT 68 FOLLOWING a bunch of balloons -- all congratulating "Happy Anniversary!" -- as a delivery boy carries them through the casino, and just as he's passing an "Employees Only" door (complete with sentry and embedded ceiling camera)... ... he bumps into a TOURIST, and the balloons drift out of his hand and into the camera... ,438
SLIM 433, we have visual impairment on the east door camera. 70 INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - BY CAGE DOOR - NIGHT 70 The SENTRY (#433) hears this and spots the balloons covering the embedded camera and approaches the delivery boy (who by freak accident happens to be Virgil Malloy)... ,11
VIRGIL Who you calling 'bud,' pal? ,16
VIRGIL Who you calling 'friend'... (can't think of another) ... bud... ,2160000
It's called a 'sense of direction.' Apparently we're all supposed to have one... ,1
His job done, he exhales and wipes the sweat from his brow and checks his palm for directions and... ,1
Whoops. ,2330000
His sweat just smeared the ballpoint. ,1
He's flying blind. ,37
He looks left down a corridor, then right, trying to remember which way he came from. ,1
He takes a left... ,37
Whoops again: here comes Fat, dead ahead. ,1
Virgil quickly snatches them back... ,10200000
He tries again. ,30700
Red flashes to green. ,7
He pulls the door... ... but Fat blocks it. ,1
Fat holds out Livingston's receiver and drops it in his hand. (CONTINUED) OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 51. 85 CONTINUED: 85 LIVINGSTON Thanks. ,30300
DANNY Well... ,11800
RUSTY Yeah... ,5240
We need those codes, Linus. ,13
LINUS Benedict. ,12200
DANNY For now. ,2860
You gotta walk before you crawl. ,2310
DANNY (toward the Malloys) Sixth task: transport... 88 EXT. BILLY TIM'S VAN AND TRUCK DEALERSHIP - OFFICE - DAY 88 Outside a window: Turk and Virgil jump up and down on opposite bumpers of a van, testing its durability. ,19
Inside, Frank negotiates with BILLY TIM, a Cal- Worthingtonesque redneck car dealer, who half-pays attention to him, half-frets over the Malloys outside. ,2
BILLY TIM I'm sorry: eighteen-five each is the best offer I can make you. ,2
FRANK (playing a bit of a dandy) Oh, I understand perfectly. ,49000
They are beautiful vans. ,15
Well, I thank you for your time, Mister...? ,2
BILLY TIM Denham. ,700
Billy Tim Denham. ,701
FRANK Yes, Denham, like a jean. (they shake) You know: you have lovely hands -- do you moisturize? ,7
FRANK I swear by it. ,5
I try all sorts of lotions. ,16
I went through a fragrance-free period last year, but now I'm liking this new brand fortified with rose hip. ,15
My sister, you know, she uses the aloe vera with the sun screen built in... ,15
BILLY TIM (just can't get his hand back) Uh-huh. ,3
You said you'd be willing to pay in cash? ,2
FRANK I did. ,87700
You know: they say cinnamon is wonderful for your pores. ,14
Read that on the internet. ,6270000
And that ideally you should be wearing gloves to bed, but I find that would interfere with my social agenda. ,14
Problem is: I get a reaction to camphor so I can't use traditional remedies... ,13
BILLY TIM If you could pay cash, I could probably drop the price a little. ,7
To, say, seventeen... (as Frank squeezes a little) ... sixteen each. ,7
DANNY ... ,17000000
DANNY Get your wallet. 90 INT. HABERDASHERY 90 A tailor fits Saul for the finest suits Tishkoff's money can buy. ,2660
SAUL It's very nice. ,5
Danny nods to the tailor: "Give us a moment." DANNY Saul, you sure you're ready to do this? ,24100
SAUL If you ever question me again, Daniel, you won't wake up the following morning. ,1
DANNY You're ready. ,5
SAUL Hello. ,1410
He continues to practice, his accent even deeper now and specifying no geographic origin -- could be Scottish, could be Israeli... ,1
SAUL My name is Lyman Zerga... ,2
My name is Lyman Zerga... ,28
Try to make it last. ,600000
He approaches a V.I.P CONCIERGE... ,1
V.I.P. ,6550000
CONCIERGE Good afternoon, sir. ,21
I'd like a suite, please. ,5
V.I.P. ,6540000
CONCIERGE Do you have a reservation with us? ,2
SAUL (long glare at him) I don't make reservations. ,1
A longer glance at Lyman's bodyguards tells the Concierge this is not a man to be denied. ,1
RUSTY Okay. ,3530
Tell me about Benedict. ,25100
He is Vegas royalty, yet he denies eye contact to no man. ,1
LINUS (V.O.) He arrives at the Bellagio every day at two p.m. ,67200
Same Town Car, same driver. ,3
Remembers every valet's name on the way in. ,5
He works hard, hits the lobby floor at seven on the nose. ,2
Benedict likes to know what's going on in his casinos. ,3
He's fluent in Spanish, German and Italian, and he's taking Japanese lessons, getting pretty good at it. ,3
He's out by seven-thirty, when an assistant hands him a black portfolio. ,77400000
Contents: the day's take and new security codes. ,2
Then he heads to the restaurant. ,220000
He is as smart and ruthless as they come. ,3
LINUS He doesn't just go after your knees, he goes after your livelihood. ,3
And everyone-you- ever-met's livelihood. ,3
RUSTY You scared? ,969
LINUS You suicidal? ,1000
LINUS Now comes the girl... if she comes in after he does, that means they're in a snit. ,1
RUSTY Where's she come from? ,1
LINUS The museum downstairs. ,342000
She's the curator there. ,9
Wait... here she is. ,21
You'll like this. ,6320000
RUSTY Tess. ,946
LINUS What? ,469000
Where'd you get this? ,107000
He whips an air hose from his mouth and inhales deeply. ,1
Danny checks his watch. ,321
DANNY 29:47. ,5
Everything okay in there? ,13800
Yen responds. ,1020
RUSTY Tell me this isn't about her. ,1
She's with Terry Benedict now. ,3
Tell me this isn't about screwing the guy who's screwing your wife. ,4
DANNY Ex-wife. ,2130
RUSTY Tell me. ,1140
DANNY It's not. ,11800
About that. ,16200000
Entirely. ,13800000
We weren't gonna hurt anybody. ,20
We weren't gonna steal from anybody didn't have it coming. ,11
And we were gonna play the game like we had nothing to lose. ,5
Well, I lost something. ,18
Someone. ,18100000
That's why I'm here. ,810000
RUSTY Here's the problem: we're stealing two things now. ,1
And when push comes to shove, if you can't have both, which are you gonna choose? ,5
And remember: Tess doesn't divide eleven ways. ,2
DANNY If things go to plan, I won't be the one who has to make that choice. ,1
Tess... ,13300000
CLOSE ON PICASSO'S WOMAN WITH GUITAR TESS (V.O.) 'Radiant' is the word. ,9640
At a distance, admiring it, are Tess, the SELLER and the seller's AIDE-DE-CAMP. A staff photographer and other personnel mill nearby. ,19900
He makes her both erotic and grotesque. ,1
He's hopelessly drawn to her, and yet she drives him crazy. ,1
Do you think Mr. Benedict will be late? ,77000
TESS Mr. Benedict is never late. ,1
All that's missing is a blare of trumpets. ,371000
BENEDICT Am I late? ,1
I had to iron out a few issues with my fight promoter. ,2
I gave him an unlimited budget, and he exceeded it. ,34
BENEDICT We hope. ,2050
TESS Here it is. ,6
SELLER Done. ,4340
She's yours. ,239000
BENEDICT Not mine. ,7
She belongs to everyone who comes into my hotel. ,1
You can't put a price on beauty. ,7560
But I shouldn't philosophize. ,1
I own casinos, after all. ,1
Mr. Santaniello has a plane to catch. ,4310
Tess appears beside him. ,1
TESS You like it? ,3
It seems Mike Tyson will be wearing red on Saturday night. ,2
Red trunks with a white stripe. ,1720000
And when the TV cameras pick us up in the front row, that red dress... ,1
TESS I see. ,10000
BENEDICT He's a charming man, but no one's going to be watching him when they can make a study of you. ,1
I hope you're not too disappointed. ,5700
BENEDICT Are you sure? ,1130
She nods, smiles faintly. ,1
He recoils ever so slightly. ,7
TESS What? ,8700
We're alone. ,485000
He lets his eyes wander along the length of the ceiling, over all the eye-in-the-sky cameras hidden there. ,1
She follows his look. ,23
But he kisses her anyway. ,32
TESS I'll see you tonight. ,1
He glances once more on the Picasso as he moves away. ,312000
HIGH ROLLER #1 Weak stomach, Mr. Zerga? ,21600000
SAUL I don't believe in weakness. ,2
It costs too much. ,630000
He approaches the PIT BOSS by the entrance. ,116000
BENEDICT Eddie. ,3160
Anything for me? ,895000
Lyman Zerga. ,3660
In the third position. ,525000
Wishes to speak with you privately. ,6410
BENEDICT Who is he? ,9
He's very vague, but I asked around. ,1
Word is he deals primarily in arms. ,319000
BENEDICT Zerga? ,2
Never heard of him. ,332000
That's why I don't doubt it. ,1
BENEDICT He's staying here? ,85500
He's in the Mirador suite. ,7
BENEDICT How's he doing? ,1120000
DANNY I'm out. ,32
TESS You're out. ,7
DANNY Of prison. ,3
You remember. ,11200000
The day I went for cigarettes and never came back. ,1
You must have noticed. ,72500000
TESS Funny, I never got a check. ,304
Danny smiles. ,7630
Tess stares daggers. ,1
TESS I sold it. ,9
Or didn't you get the papers? ,7
DANNY My last day inside. ,8
TESS I told you I'd write. ,9
TESS Danny. ,2120
Go. Now. ,6910000
Before... ,38300000
DANNY Benedict? ,3030
He smiles: it's okay. ,2
TESS Danny... ,2090
DANNY You're doing a great job curating the museum. ,1
She sighs, exasperated. ,3280
DANNY The Vermeer is quite good. ,1
Simple but vibrant. ,24100
Although his work definitely fell off as he got older. ,8
Which one married his mistress? ,4400
TESS Monet. ,2230
DANNY Right. ,6630
Manet had syphilis. ,1060000
TESS They also painted occasionally. ,104
DANNY You don't know how many times I played this conversation out in my head the last two years. ,3810000
TESS Did it always go this poorly? ,1660000
DANNY Yes. ,31100
I'll make this quick. ,105000
I came here for you. ,1200000000
TESS You're a thief and a liar. ,653
DANNY I only lied about being a thief. ,70
But I don't do that anymore. ,34
TESS Steal? ,3550
DANNY Lie. ,3300
TESS Nice. ,2290
DANNY Year and a half. ,2
TESS Do you know what your problem is? ,8
DANNY I only have one? ,22
DANNY Does he make you laugh? ,554
A friend of mine once borrowed a hundred g's from the guy. ,148000
Benedict steps forward. ,28
How's everything? ,16500000
BENEDICT And here I thought you were drinking vodka. (turning attention to Saul) Mr. Zerga. ,14700
SAUL Mr. Benedict. ,10
I recognize you from the TV. You know, nine casinos out of ten, owner comes up in the middle of the hand to ask me what I want. ,1
You're the king of Vegas and you have to play craps in the alley. ,1
Reminds me of my youth. ,84700
BENEDICT Yes. ,6530
I can get you seats... ,21
SAUL No, no. ,1300
Hand-to-hand combat doesn't interest me. ,226000
I have a package arriving here Saturday evening. ,1
A black briefcase, standard size, the contents of which are very valuable to me. ,1
I'm afraid I need something more secure. ,1
Now: what can you offer me besides the safe? ,22000000
They get made whole again. ,72600000
DANNY You can't. ,43800
But what you can do is not throw away another five years. ,2
But not him. ,159000
TESS Spoken like a true ex-husband. ,2
DANNY I'm not joking, Tess. ,368000
But that doesn't mean I'm wrong. ,59400
She looks down at his ring, somewhat wistful. ,1
He sees her looking at it. ,2
TESS Do you remember what I said to you when we first met? ,2
DANNY You said: you better know what you're doing. ,1
TESS Do you? ,3570
Now? ,47200000
Because -- truly -- you should walk out the door if you don't. ,4
DANNY I know what I'm doing. ,9
BENEDICT What are you doing? ,1210
DANNY Catching up. ,770
A guest required my attention. ,5
TESS Danny was just walking through the restaurant and spotted me. ,1
Imagine the odds. ,84500
How does it feel to be out? ,26
DANNY About the same. ,4
BENEDICT There's the human condition for you. ,1
DANNY I just wanted to say hello. ,3
For old time's sake. ,105000
DANNY You never know. ,3000
TESS Take care, Danny. ,9
Danny goes. ,26700
When he's out the door... ,5
There's a KNOCK at the door... ,188000
BENEDICT Good to see you. ,6
Rusty leads everyone in a run-down of the heist... ,1
Makeup and costume. ,118000
Saul's package arrives at seven-fifteen, and Linus grabs our codes. ,14
All goes well there and we're a go. ,2
Seven- thirty Virgil and Turk deliver Yen and we're committed. ,1
From that point, we have thirty minutes to blow the power or he suffocates. ,2
The Bellagio vault. ,1430
That's when we make our move... ,10
When the vault LOCKS CLICK... ... ,1
He takes in the room: vacant and silent. ,1
Except for Rusty, who walks right by him, incongruously. ,1
You have to get from here to the door without touching the floor. ,51600000
FRANK Fin says he shorts it. ,1
From this position, he'll inch his way to a counter, then, to the door... ,1
Frank pays up. ,8
LIVINGSTON I'll explain later. ,281000
Only they did it by accident. ,1
Now they know their weakness. ,6
And they're fixing it. ,5580
DANNY So... ,49800
Or better yet: A pinch is a bomb... but without the bomb. ,7
Every time a nuclear weapon detonates, it unleashes an electromagnetic pulse which shuts down any power source within its vicinity. ,5
That tends not to matter in most cases because the nuclear weapon destroys everything you might need power for anyway. ,5
Now a pinch creates a similar electromagnetic pulse, but without the headache of mass destruction and death. ,4
So instead of Hiroshima, you get the Seventeenth Century. ,5
Like, I don't... ,7030000
DANNY Where? ,9400
DANNY What are you doing? ,18200
Danny smiles and shakes his head. ,16
Meanwhile, up front, another Mensa meeting has been called to order... ,1
VIRGIL Are you a man? ,12
TURK Yes. ,5810
Nineteen. ,19800000
VIRGIL Are you alive? ,18
TURK Yes. ,6010
Eighteen. ,21900000
VIRGIL Evel Knievel. ,15
SAME SCENE - LATER VIRGIL Co-sign squared over .0455. ,46100
TURK One-five. ,8
VIRGIL You're so wrong. ,245000
TURK You don't know your string theory, bitch. (CONTINUED) OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 83. 124 CONTINUED: 124 SAME SCENE - LATER After a spell of silence... ,31700
VIRGIL Mom told me she loves me more. ,2
TURK She told me she was going to tell you that. ,1
DANNY We got it. ,6
Turk floors it, and they're off. (CONTINUED) OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 84. 126 CONTINUED: 126 DANNY Wait a minute. ,915
Just then: SIRENS and ALARMS and lights come to life. ,1
Uh-oh. ,4420000
His eyes scan the compound, then: DANNY There he is. ,116000
As he ascends out of sight... ,4
BASHER (who speaks Danny's mind) Then there'll be two of us who need saving. ,44700

CRASH! 127 OMITTED 127 & & 128 128 129 EXT. LABORATORY - NIGHT 129 A second-story WINDOW EXPLODES as a desk chair flies through it, followed shortly by Linus who leaps onto a steel-mesh overhang running alongside the building. 130 OMITTED 130 A131 INT. VAN A131 DANNY Alright, back it up, back it up! Virgil leaps into the driver's seat, shifts into reverse. ,16200
TISHKOFF Where are they? ,2
That's what I want to know. ,72900000
Where are they? ,8210000
SAUL (as Lyman) They'll be here. ,13200
RUSTY You boys have a nice trip? ,1
LIVINGSTON You've been red-flagged. ,3720000
It means the moment you step on the casino floor, they'll be watching you. ,1
Like hawks. ,43000
Hawks with video cameras. ,706
DANNY This is a problem. ,1
Before Danny can answer... ,653
LINUS I do. ,5750
He's been chasing Benedict's woman. ,1
DANNY Who told you to do that? ,1
DANNY My wife. ,3950
RUSTY Ex-wife. ,32
His involvement puts us all at risk. ,4
DANNY This isn't your call. ,1
RUSTY You made it my call. ,1
You made it mine. ,34
DANNY This is my job. ,2
RUSTY Not anymore. ,30300000
TISHKOFF But, but... he can't just be out. ,102000000
Who's gonna take his place? ,28400
Rusty turns to Linus. ,1
RUSTY Kid, you up for it? ,1
Curtain goes up at seven. ,19
Livingston exits. ,31
Rusty steps out onto the balcony, perhaps to console Danny, but (as Linus watches them from inside) their words cannot be heard. (CONTINUED) OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 92. 141 CONTINUED: (3) 141 SAUL Tess is with Benedict now? (as nobody responds) She's too tall for him. 142 OMITTED 142 & & 143 143 144 INT. BENEDICT'S SUITE - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT 144 Tess, readying herself for the big evening, meets her own glance in a dressing mirror, then spots Benedict in its reflection, pacing the bedroom behind her. ,2
BENEDICT (on phone) Yes. ,2900000
TESS You. ,28300
She smiles at him in the mirror. ,1
The time is 7:00. ,24
BENEDICT Any sign of Ocean? ,1
MANAGER (WALSH) Not in a couple hours. ,1
You want him out? ,40
I can bounce him from the state for parole violation if you like. ,1
BENEDICT (shakes his head) Put a guy on him. ,1
He's here for a reason. ,36
I'd like to know what it is. ,5
MANAGER Bruiser? ,935
Benedict nods, goes on his way. 148 AT CASINO ENTRANCE 148 Saul, as Lyman Zerga, stands ramrod straight, looking through sliding glass doors out at the valet station. ,37
SAUL Mr. Benedict. ,10
BENEDICT Mr. Zerga. ,1
Are we on schedule? ,47
My couriers should be here momentarily. ,2
BENEDICT It's a nice evening. ,2970000
Shall we wait outside? ,8
We're a go. 150 EXT. BELLAGIO CASINO - VALET AREA - SUNSET 150 A white, unmarked van pulls in from the street and races up to the curb where Saul and Benedict wait. ,33
A gift from Mr. Hesse. ,5920000
His eyes gaze past his players to Saul, the guards and Benedict passing by. ,6520
To one of his guards... ,32
BENEDICT I'm afraid I can't allow my private security personnel inside the casino cages. ,73500
I hope you don't mind... ,489000
SAUL Of course not. ,6
Saul Bloom, is that you? ,10
Bucky Buchanan, remember? ,23
From Saratoga. ,233000
RUSTY Where you gonna put your hands? ,9
Linus clasps them. ,490000
RUSTY No... ,17600
And don't touch your tie. ,1
Look at me... ,6440000
Linus does. ,237000
RUSTY Wrong again. ,7
Linus looks down. ,31
RUSTY Death. ,3150
Inside the case: five rows of glittering emeralds. (CONTINUED) OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 98. 155 CONTINUED: 155 BENEDICT They're very beautiful. ,45500
A gift. ,14300000
Saul stares at him: none of your fucking business. ,1
BENEDICT Can you lift them out, please? ,1
Saul lifts the velvet tray out of the case, and Benedict pats down the case's interior. ,1
Saul replaces the tray. ,1
BENEDICT Alright, Mr. Zerga. ,2
I acknowledge that the case does not contain any dangerous or illicit material. ,2
I further agree to take custody of your case for a twenty-four hour period to store in our secured vault. ,2
While I cannot permit you to accompany the case to the vault... ,2
SAUL Why not? ,3250
BENEDICT Insurance, for one. ,3
Security, another. ,56000
And I don't trust you. ,18
There is a KNOCK at the door, and Walsh the casino manager enters. ,1
He speaks low in Benedict's ear. ,1
WALSH (MANAGER) I put two plainclothes on Ocean. ,1
He's at the keno bar now. ,2
Walsh nods, and Benedict turns back to Saul. ,1
BENEDICT Mr. Zerga, this is Mr. Walsh, my casino manager. ,1
If you will allow, he will arrange for your briefcase to be stored inside our vault while you watch on a security monitor. (beat) Those are my terms. ,21200
Yes or no? ,6860000
Saul and Benedict eyeball each other. ,1
SAUL You leave me no choice. ,1
Saul unlocks the cuff from his wrist. ,1
RUSTY You ready? ,9
WALSH This is our security center, where we oversee all gaming in the casino as well as our vault. ,803000
You'll be able to monitor your briefcase from here. ,1
Benedict checks his watch. ,5
SAUL Don't let me keep you. ,1
BENEDICT Mr. Zerga... ,1

Nevada Gaming Commission. ,51400
Could I have two minutes of your time? ,2
BENEDICT Of course. ,7320

No one responds. ,72800

RUSTY Okay. ,3520
I'm counting down. ,704000
Thirty minutes of breathing time starts... now. ,28
RUSTY Did you make it out? ,1
LIVINGSTON His head blocked the last two numbers. (into his microphone) We missed it, Linus. ,49400
BENEDICT You new at the commission? ,8
LINUS Been there about two years. ,7
BENEDICT I know Hal Lindley over there. ,2
He passes. ,481000
Would you come with us, please? ,4

MAITRE D' I can put you at 19 in just a couple minutes. ,876000
She, of course, merits a table instantly. ,233000
MAITRE D' Good evening, Miss Ocean. ,1130000
Right this way... ,368000
His eyes linger a little too long and a little too low... ,6670000
VOICE (O.S.) Hey... ,1390
TISHKOFF (shocked to see Danny; thinks he's off the job, but covering) Yeah, pal, well only if you take your thumb out of your... ... ,52
You're pulling a job, aren't you? ,10
DANNY Tess... ,2000
TESS Well, know this: no matter what it is, you won't win me back. ,1670000
I can't afford it. ,369000
DANNY I just came to say good-bye. (CONTINUED) OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 105. 168 CONTINUED: 168 This surprises Tess, and, truth be told, saddens her; she studies him a moment, unsure of what to say. ,1600

Formerly of the Tropicana, the Desert Inn and the New York State penitentiary system? (MORE) (CONTINUED) 106. 170 CONTINUED: 170 LINUS (CONT'D) (as Frank remains quiet) Your silence suggests you don't refute that. (to Benedict) Mr. Benedict, I'm afraid you've been employing an ex-convict. ,3
As you know, the N.G.C. strictly forbids... ,2
FRANK (under his breath) Goddamn cracker... ,1
Just 'cause a black man tries to earn a decent wage in this state... ,4
LINUS That has nothing to do with... ,5
FRANK (over him, ranting) ... some cracker cowboy like you's gotta kick him out on the street. ,23100
Want me to jump down, turn around, pick a bale of cotton, won't let me deal cards, might as well call it whitejack. ,4
I mean... ,13000000
I lost my card. ,672000
A SECURITY OFFICER approaches. ,1920
VIRGIL I think... ,14500
Jesus! I lost my keycard. ,22700
Leave the cart. ,139000
BASHER I'm there. ,2
LINUS Of course. ,2910
But halfway there... ,3730
I forgot it. ,426000
LINUS Of course. ,2290
Enjoy the fight. ,324000
GOON #1 Just a few minutes more. ,5620000

BRUISER Pregnant again. ,34
SAUL Yes, I'm very satisfied. ,811000

It's Danny. ,231000
DANNY I do now. ,1
Linus does the same. ,8
LINUS How'd you get here? ,8
DANNY Crawlspace. ,1
LINUS But what about -- I mean, that whole thing with Rusty... ,30900000
Danny just smiles at him. ,8
Why not just tell me? ,225000
At the same time, he inspects a monitor: the vault door closing with the Yen-filled cash cart and Saul's briefcase inside. ,11100
RUSTY He's gone. ,16
He's dead. ,899000
LINUS Huh? ,154
LINUS (shrugs) I'd go in for a buck. ,7710
DANNY (into his mike) Livingston, we're set. ,1
Yen's gonna pass out in thirteen seconds. ,290000
The fighters break from their corners, feinting, jabbing... ,66900
DANNY Never. ,11300
BASHER (into his mike) Ready. ,1
LIVINGSTON (V.O.) (over earpiece) Then hit it. ,1
Basher flips the switch. ,1
BOOM! A quick TREMOR, then stillness. ,1
He picks a point on the horizon, like Babe Ruth, and suddenly... ,1
BASHER ... ,988000
One... ,48500000

And now, looking STRAIGHT DOWN, the ground is rising up fast to meet them, a flat slab of gray concrete -- fifty feet, forty feet, thirty feet, twenty... ,1
BASHER ... eight, nine... ,1

UZI-CARRYING GUARD #1 (sniffing something) Jesus, Ron, was that you? 215 OUTSIDE VAULT CORRIDOR 215 Linus and Danny wait, Danny silently mouthing a three- count before... ,2850
Linus starts in, Danny holds him back... ,402000
DANNY Not yet. (a beat; another beat; then) Okay. 216 INT. VAULT CORRIDOR 216 Danny and Linus enter, waving the faint remnants of the gas from their noses, tiptoeing past the guards' bodies. ,8
A217 INT. VAULT A217 Saul's briefcase inches closer to falling off the cash cart, which of course would trigger the floor sensor and terminate this heist here and now. ,4
He's got it. ,2110000

Let's get him out. ,256000
FRANK Fin says he shorts it. ,1
LIVINGSTON No bet. ,18
FRANK That's it? ,13900
Not much we can do about that from this side of the door. ,94600
But from this side... ,50600
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 124. 223 INT. VAULT 223 Yen sets the last of Lyman's emeralds against the vault door like a plastic explosive... which, of course, it is. ,18

J224 INT. VAULT J224 Yen, still on the door, remains frozen. ,1100
Trembling. ,2100000
LINUS What's wrong? ,1090
DANNY I don't know. ,75000
Danny blanches. ,44
Saul enters, alive and dressed as himself again. ,286000
His job is complete. ,416000
SAUL Everything going okay? 225 INT. VAULT CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE VAULT 225 As Danny checks his batteries (the types with built-in power meters: both at zero percent), Linus ransacks the Uzi-carrying Guards' gear for replacements. ,15
DANNY Amazing? ,3980
Yen pops up from within, his hair on end, looking like he just dropped out of a cyclone. ,4450
Smiles all around. ,133000
TESS Hello? ,4550
Tess looks up, confused. ,2
TESS It's for you. ,1
BENEDICT Who the hell is this? ,4
RUSTY The man who's robbing you. 126. 230 INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - EYE IN THE SKY 230 Benedict enters, and fear enters with him. ,1470
And, of course, Tess. ,1340
FAT Nothing, sir. ,2
All normal. ,496000
BENEDICT Show me. ,5350
FAT All quiet. ,63000
Okay, keep watching. ,1190
BENEDICT Jesus Christ... ,1640
Tess, amid all this chaos, is still curious: how did that cell phone get into her handbag? ,7310
And suddenly it hits her... ,6830
You've proved your point. ,13300
You've broken into my vault. ,63900000
Congratulations: you're a dead man. ,8200
Tess leaves. ,2810
BENEDICT May I ask: how do you expect to leave here, hmm? ,3620000
RUSTY No. You're gonna carry it out for us. ,1
RUSTY Take a closer look at your monitor... ,1
RUSTY (V.O.) You may notice: we're only packing up about half that. ,339000
That's the deal. ,2050000
It's your decision. ,1480000
He cups the phone. ,7
He makes his choice... ,39500000
VOICE (V.O.) 911. ,1
You have a deal. ,38
TESS Where's Danny? ,1
RUSTY He's fine. ,11
Here's what you do. ,2480000
Five minutes from now, the men in the vault are going to deposit six bags in the vault elevator. ,1
Tess isn't sure what to do. ,1
Six of your guards will pick up the bags and carry them out into the casino. ,1
Six guards do precisely that. 131. 244 INT. CASINO - NIGHT 244 MOVING WITH Rusty PAST slot machines... ,692
RUSTY (V.O.) Of course, I'm in the casino. ,52600000
Meanwhile, behind the casino, a SWAT van arrives and unloads its squad. ,12100
RUSTY (V.O.) Now, when I get word that the van hasn't been followed, that the money is secure, my men will exit the building, and once their safety is confirmed, you'll get your vault back. 249 INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - EYE IN THE SKY 249 Walsh mouths to Benedict: "SWAT team is here." Benedict nods and throws him a thumbs-up. ,80
BENEDICT Sir, I have complied with your every request, would you agree? ,1
BENEDICT Good. ,6390
Now I have one of my own. ,3
If you get picked up next week buying a $100,000 sports car in Newport Beach, I'll be supremely disappointed. ,1
Because I want my people to find you. ,4
That's all I ask. ,1320000
And during the above rant by Benedict, we view... ,3
ON TV: a newscast of the contentious aftermath of the prize fight. ,4
He hangs up. ,68600
I want my vault back before that van hits the tarmac. ,16
LONGER MONTAGE now, CUTTING BETWEEN: 255 SWAT TEAM 255 (six in all) hustling through the cage corridors, armed to the teeth, with body armor and helmets and vision guards: they're as faceless as storm troopers. ,6
With the briefcase? ,7470000
Prepare to cut power. ,6
FAT Ready when you are. ,1
The SWAT team prepares to invade on another. ,1
BENEDICT Do it. ,3280

Benedict listens closely to the SWAT frequency. ,1
SWAT FREQUENCY (V.O.) (Leader's voice) First wave, in! Second wave, now! (there is RUNNING, PANTING, then Linus's voice, distant and panicked) Guys, someone's here! (Leader's voice) Take him down! Now! A brief SPURT of GUNFIRE, then... ,2
They blew the... ,61900
BENEDICT Yes. ,6580
I'm sorry, sir. ,236000
SWAT LEADER Okay, guys, grab your gear and clear out. ,151000
Inside: There is no driver. ,23
He does, however, happen to notice one burning shred of paper dislodged from a bag: It's a promotional flier for a call girl service. ,3360
BENEDICT Yes? ,6250
WALSH (V.O.) They took the van. ,429000
BENEDICT And? ,365000
WALSH (V.O.) Sir... sir... ,370000
For hookers. ,86400
It doesn't. ,8320000
The image we saw of the men robbing us was a tape. ,1
WALSH (V.O.) What? ,6450000
BENEDICT Someone built a double of my vault, then made a tape of them robbing it. ,65700
WALSH Then, sir... ,12700000
LIVINGSTON 9-1-1. ,11
Rusty flips open another cell phone... ,1

DANNY (a little punchy) Heya, Benedict... ,29400
How's the other fight going? ,9
Benedict keeps his cool. ,353000
BENEDICT Did you have a hand in this? (beat) Did you? ,2560000
DANNY Did I have a hand in what? ,2690000
BENEDICT Get him out of here. ,1
Walsh approaches. ,875
DANNY You get robbed or something, Benedict? ,1
Geez, that's a shame. ,3530
BENEDICT Stop there. ,1
BENEDICT Where. ,10600
Is. My. Money. ,3200000
He grins. ,77500
Benedict sinks. ,9
And contact the police. ,46
A290 INT. CAGE/HALLWAY A290 WALSH Maybe we should have held him. ,10
She breezes right past him. ,4
Three-and-a-half seconds pass. ,2
They take each other in, shake hands, and part. 294 EXT. BELLAGIO CASINO - NIGHT 294 Tess exits, searching for Danny. ,9740
She rounds the building to... 295 EXT. SERVICE ENTRANCE 295 Where a LVPD squad car has just arrived to take goon-held Danny away. ,16
She runs toward it. ,3390
TESS How long will you be? ,4
The squad car door closes him in and Tess stands vigil as it pulls away. 296 ACROSS STREET 296 Rusty watches Danny being driven back to prison, too. ,10300
He looks forward -- no one's there to greet him, and the view of New Jersey looks no brighter than it did before. ,1
He takes his first step into free America... ... to discover Rusty leaning against the prison wall. ,1
Beyond him sits his second-hand Mercedes from L.A. ,1
RUSTY Looking for someone? ,24
DANNY Thirteen million and you drive that piece of shit cross country to pick me up? ,4
RUSTY Hello to you, too. ,8
They shakes hands. ,918
MOVING WITH Danny and Rusty toward the Mercedes, together again. ,248000
RUSTY I stopped and picked up your personal effects, put them in the back seat. ,333000
DANNY My what? ,14
She smiles at him. ,58200
TESS Sure they do. ,1740000
TESS That's what I said. ,5
DANNY Liar. ,5440
TESS Thief. ,2670
Glowing torches light the way. ,3
Blurry, indistinct silhouettes of grim FIGURES wearing black-cowled robes flash along the dank, craggy walls. ,3
As we BLAST around dark corners, we realize we are looking from the P.O.V. of a SCREAMING young woman being pushed forward on a gurney. ,1
Plunging deeper into this hellish maze. ,3
A door is SLAMMED. Wooden. ,2
Heavy. ,17100000
Muffling the SCREAMS. Spurs CLANK on a pair of silver-tipped cowboy boots as a MYSTERIOUS STRANGER steps into VIEW. Long black duster. ,1
Widebrimmed fedora. ,403
Lit cigarette dangling between gloved fingers. ,4
INT. BIRTHING CHAMBER - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) A rat scampers from a hole, foraging in the muck of a rotted rack. ,1
A white sheet, saturated with blood, covers the parted legs of JAMIE LLOYD, now 16, cheeks flushed with perspiration. ,2
JAMIE Oh, God, it's coming! It's coming! MARY, a young midwife, rushes in with a bowl of hot water. ,3
Jamie lurches, knocking the bowl out of the girl's hands; it SHATTERS on the floor. ,3
JAMIE (continuing) Mary, mother of God, please make it stop! Mary's face is frozen in horror. ,1
Jamie's SCREAMS build to an unnerving crescendo. ,2
The paiin too much for her to bear. ,1
FLASH CUT TO: Lurid SHOCK CUTS from the previous "Halloween" entries -- a surrealistic blend of IMAGES and VOICES -- as Jamie relives her terrifying childhood ordeal: LOOMIS (V.O.) ... ,1
Ten years ago he tried to kill Laurie Strode ... ,36
A) LAURIE STRODE (Jamie Lee Curtis) twists and squirms as she is strangled mercilessly in the hands of the murderous SHAPE. LOOMIS (V.O.) ... ,2
Now he wants her daughter. ,2
B) Trapped in her bedroom, 10-YEAR-OLD JAMIE (Danielle Harris) struggles to open the door. ,2
She flings it open. ,1640
TINA (Wendy Kaplan) dives right into the path of the Shape's knife. "Jamie, run!!!" D) Jamie sinks to her knees behind the fallen Shape, taking its hand in her own. ,1
Fingers flexing to life. ,1
A grotesque BRAND on its wrist -- an inverted isocsceles triangle that will come to be known as the mark of THORN. E) BLINDING EXPLOSION rips through cinderblock. ,1320
A jail cell blown to oblivion. ,21600
FIRESTORM rages. ,1590
The MYSTERIOUS STRANGER appears, opening fire with a SEMI-AUTOMATIC RIFLE. Pitiful wails of death. ,1
OFFICERS writhing in pools of blood. ,2
In the aftermath of this carnage stands YOUNG JAMIE. FLASH CUT TO: INT. CHAMBER - NIGHT (SAME) Jamie struggles against her bonds. ,1
Pushing. ,13500000
SCREAMING. Lapsing in and out of consciousness during the excruciating pangs of labor. ,2
JAMIE'S P.O.V. ,41
Beyond the clearing wisps of smoke, THREE FIGURES wearing black ski masks usher THE SHAPE -- arms and legs shackled in heavy chains -- into the back of a white van. ,3
A cigarette arcs throug the darkness like a tiny flare. ,1
Crushed under the boot of the Stranger. ,3
A moment later, Jamie is shoved into the front seat of the van. ,2
Doors SLAM. Tires SCREECH over wet pavement. ,19200
THE ENTIRE PRECINCT EXPLODES IN A HUGE CONFLAGRATION! SHOCK CUT TO: INT. CHAMBER - NIGHT A SLAP and the first cry of the newborn BABY. Jamie sobs uncontrollably, the straps preventing her from reaching him. ,46
JAMIE Please ... give him to me ... ,2
The infant is wrapped in black swaddling. ,35700
The wooden door CREAKS open. ,1350
Jamie's eyes fill with horror as the shadow of the Stranger fills the room. ,3
Standing at the threshold. ,44600
Waiting to receive the child. ,1
JAMIE (continuing) No, please ... my baby! The dark sentinels march out in somber procession, ignoring her desperate pleas. ,1
Torches lighting the way. ,8620
Ringed by eleven stones engraved with cryptic markings. ,3
Hooded, faceless figures. ,234
Torches held aloft. ,1360
Disembodied VOICES. Whispering. ,1900
Invoking a dark spell. ,4
MARY, the young midwife, peers around a corner. ,3
Eyes glazed with horror. ,50
Watching. ,17900000
The newborn SCREAMS. The flattened blade of a dagger smears a triangular symbol in blood over the baby's torso. ,2
We MOVE IN on this symbol, capturing it in FREEZE FRAME. It burns off into fiery cinders, disintegrating into DARKNESS. Silence. ,1
Then a startling CLAP OF THUNDER as we SHOCK CUT TO: A SIGN POST standing askew in a matted patch of lawn. ,1
WIND and RAIN. INTENSE FLASH of LIGHTNING illuminates: "For Sale By Strode Realty - SOLD" EXT/INT. MYERS HOUSE - SUBJECTIVE P.O.V. ,1
MOVE along a trail of drowning toys -- baseball, Power Rangers, a deck of Pogs -- TOWARD a weather-beaten porch. ,1
Leftover gallons of Sears Best. ,8
Brushes soaking in turpentine. ,33
A dozen or so 2 x 2s l;ined up to replace a row of broken railing slats. ,1
P.O.V. ,3590000
LOOKS UP to the tall, brooding edifice. ,2
Address reads: 45 Lampkin Lane. ,4
Fresh coat of white paint over old clapboard. ,3
New shutters on the narrow windows. ,2
A jack-o'-lantern grins behind filmy curtains. ,3
The Myers house. ,11900
Despite its recent face-lift, it looks just as foreboding as it did in "Halloween I." P.O.V. stalks down the side of the house, around to the back door. ,1
Opens it and quietly MOVES inside. ,3
P.O.V. ,3530000
MOVES across the darkened kitchen. ,4
A drawer is opened. ,18800
LIGHTNING reveals a large butcher knife being withdrawn. ,2
P.O.V. glides past the living room -- a few boxes, furniture to be arranged -- and MOVES swiftly UP a long flight of stairs. ,1
Down the long, dark hallway ... through a door. ,3
A bedroom. ,3540000
P.O.V. ,2920000
FINDS 6-year-old DANNY STRODE ... tossing and turning in the throes of a nightmare. ,1
An ear-splitting THUNDER CRASH causes the boy to bolt upright in bed, looking right into the P.O.V. ,1
Sweating. ,9990000
Shaking. ,13100000
Petrified. ,2370000
DANNY'S P.O.V. ,18400
The THUNDER seems to ROAR from the ferocious jaws of T-REX -- a 24" scale model posing on a shelf among an army of Jurassic monsters. ,2
Seemingly brought to life by the ELECTRICAL STORM. FOLLOW DANNY as he leaps out of bed and pads across polished wooden floors into the hallway. ,1
LIGHTNING FLASHES. With the next THUNDER CRASH comes a startling, barely intelligible VOICE. WHISPERING VOICE (O.S.) Danny ... ,2
Danny freezes. ,5510
Slowly turns. ,97400
DANNY'S POV An ominous shadow at the end of the hall, illuminated by LIGHTNING. Long duster and brimmed hat. ,138000
The Stranger! In his outstretched hand, the gleaming butcher knife! WHISPERING VOICE (O.S.) Kill for him! BACK TO SCENE Danny screams! THUNDER CRASHES HELLISHLY. Lights flash on. ,1
Doors fly open. ,8290
Suddenly Danny is swept up in the protective arms of his mother, KARA, 22. ,2
KARA Danny! The little boy holds onto her for dear life. ,2
Crying hysterically. ,55200
Eyes clenched tightly. ,3060
KARA (continuing) Shh. ,1
Mommy's here. ,31200
DANNY The voice man! He's here! Kara looks in the direction he's pointing. ,2
In the light there's just an antique coat rack -- "dressed" in a hat, rain jacket and old silver-tipped umbrella. ,2
KARA Danny, no one's there. ,2
Danny dares to look -- but now only cries harder. ,1
Kara carries Danny back to his room, averting the steely-eyed gaze of her father, JOHN STRODE, staunch, late 40s, wearing boxer shorts and a well-worn undershirt. ,1
JOHN Some of us have to get some sleep around here. ,2
What's with that kid? ,11
Kara ignores him as her mother, DEBRA, careworn face with compassionate eyes, tries to lend a hand. ,16900
DEBRA Let me take him for you, Kara. ,3
KARA It's all right, Mom. ,3
Go back to bed. ,944000
Debra sighs resignedly. ,3
TIM, 18, stocky and streetwise, wearing torn red sweat pants and "Ice-T" t-shirt, casually replaces his Walkman headphones and returns to his room. ,1
INT. DANNY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (A FEW MINUTES LATER) Kara opens the closet and switches on the light. ,2
Satisfying Danny that it's empty, she breaks into her perfunctory routine. ,2
KARA Stay away monters, stay away ghouls. ,4
Stay away from Danny. ,5790
You jerks know the rules. (crossing to Danny's bed) Better? ,2
Danny giggles as his pretty young mother tucks him in. ,1
DANNY Mommy, when can we go home? ,55300
Kara sighs. ,3140
KARA Home is here in Grandma and Grandpa's new house. ,873000
At least while I'm in college. ,1
Remember our deal. ,6680
DANNY The kids at school said this is a haunted house -- that a bad man used to live here. ,1
KARA They did, did they? ,2
Since when did we start listening to the kids at school? ,2
DANNY But I've seen him! KARA You've been watching too much TV. DANNY He says things. ,1
Bad things. ,12200000
KARA Like what? ,1440
Danny is afraid to tell her. ,2
KARA (continuing) If you mean the things Grandpa says sometimes, ignore him. ,1
Once he gets to know you he'll come around ... ,2
Let the bad things you hear slide right off your back. ,2
Kara tousles his blond hair and kisses his forehead. ,1
Then she goes to the closet, just about to turn out the light -- DANNY (sitting up; panicked) No, Mom -- keep it on! KARA Okay ... ,31300
But just for tonight. ,45500
Kara adjusts the closet door, causing one of Danny's school drawings to fly off the wall. ,1
KARA (continuing) Good-night, Danny. ,3
Kara softly closes the door. ,2
Danny lies awake, blankets drawn up to his chin, eyes wide. ,1
Still very much afraid. ,4220
INT. KARA'S ROOM (CONTINUOUS) Kara yawns, removes her glasses and rubs her eyes, setting Danny's drawing on a pile of open books. ,1
Cliffs Notes and Diet Coke cans. ,1
Telltale signs of a late-night cram session. ,2
I write to him every week. ,1
Beneath her studious exterior, she is quite attractive: delicate features with an enviable, naturally-toned figure. ,2
WOMAN (V.O.) Deep down, he's just like you and me. ,1
He just needs someone to understand him. ,29
Someone to love him. ,710000
KARA'S P.O.V. of the large Victorian frame house directly across the street. ,1
Another FLASH OF LIGHTNING reveals the shadow of a man standing in the uppermost window -- looking right at her! ANGLE ON KARA Frightened, her eyes lock on Danny's drawing. ,1
A child's scribbling in red Crayon: The triangular symbol of Thorn! EXT. MYERS HOUSE / BLANKENSHIP HOUSE Kara draws the priscilla curtains over the window as we PULL BACK through the pouring RAIN ... toward the house across the street. ,24
An ornate sign on the front door reads: "Blankenship House - Rooms Available" CRANE UP toward the window where the shadowy figure stands. ,2
An insidious CRASH OF THUNDER as we PUSH through the window. ,2
INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) A macabre display of old newspaper headlines, arranged helterskelter on a wall: "HALLOWEEN KILLS ESCAPES FROM ASYLUM." "HORROR IN HADDONFIELD: MICHAEL MYERS CLAIMS 16 LIVES." "REIGN OF TERROR ENDS AS MYERS PERISHES IN VIGILANTE EXPLOSION." Harry Simms BOOMS over a state-of-the-art HiFi system. ,1
A cassette tape RECORDS the continuing broadcast. ,1
HARRY SIMMS (V.O.) Now we've got someone who claims he's actually seen Michael Myers. ,2
Does this whacko caller have a name? ,3
Staring out the window at the Myers house, TOMMY DOYLE, a strapping 25-year-old with reddish brown hair and intense eyes, cradles a cordless phone. ,2
TOMMY My name's Tommy. ,554
I was only eight- years-old when I saw him. ,927000
But I was lucky. ,519000
I survived. ,1000000
Tommy paces nervously around his sparsely-furnished attic apartment. ,3
Classic horror movie one-sheets and mint first edition comic books share wall space with a chilling array of guns, knives, and survivalist weapons. ,2
HARRY SIMMS (V.O.) Sounds like you're a candidate for electroshock therapy, Tommy. ,23
Don't tell me after all this time you still believe Myers is alive?! Tommy pauses, mesmerized by one of the newspaper clippings. ,1
TOMMY Michael's work isn't finished in Haddonfield. ,1
Now it's just a matter of time before he comes home to kill again. ,1
But this time I'll be ready. ,5
MOVE IN TIGHT on the headline, frail and yellowed by age: "November 1, 1978. ,1
TOMMY DOYLE SURVIVES BABYSITTER BLOODBATH." Directly beneath this: "November 3, 1989. ,1
JAMIE LLOYD FEARED DEAD IN POLICE STATION MASSACRE." CLOSE ON a photograph of young Jamie and SLOW DISSOLVE TO: INT. DUNGEON - CHAMBER - NIGHT Jamie remains strapped to the table, wrapped in bloody sheets. ,75
Eyes closed. ,938000
Deathly still. ,8070
Suddenly an urgent, WHISPERING VOICE pierces the darkness: WHISPERING VOICE (O.S.) Jamie? ,3
Jamie?! Jamie startles awake to see the midwife frantically releasing her straps. ,2
MARY Come with me if you want to save your baby. ,77700000
Jamie can't believe her eyes. ,2
Mary opens a threadbare knapsack -- revealing the baby inside! A soul-shuddering RUMBLE echoes throughout the cavern. ,1
Jamie leaps up, eyes wide with fear, sensing the evil presence. ,114000
JAMIE Oh, God ... ,1620
He's coming! MARY We've got to move. ,1
Now! Pulsing with adrenaline, Jamie harnesses the knapsack over her shoulders and follows Mary out into the tunnels. ,2
TUNNEL GATE Chains GRIND over rusted pulleys. ,4
A massive iron gate rises, revealing a pair of filthy work boots. ,2
Legs planted in bold stance as a tall, ominous shape begins to emerge. ,2
ANOTHER TUNNEL The terrified midwife leads Jamie with her baby on a breathless flight through the winding network of tunnels. ,2
Haunted by the ECHOING SOUNDS of the rising gate. ,2
STALKING P.O.V. - THROUGH TUNNELS Gliding forward into the hollow catacombs. ,1
Slow by determined. ,13300000
Sensing the way. ,221000
ANOTHER PART OF THE TUNNELS Reaching a corner, Mary stops and sends Jamie off in the opposite direction. ,2
MARY There! It's that way! JAMIE No -- MARY Save your baby -- go now! Jamie runs, disappearing down the dark tunnel. ,1
Mary quickly removes her shoes and tears off, now SILENT. STALKING P.O.V. surges around a corner. ,1
FINDS Mary. ,12100
MOVES IN on her. ,1160000
ANOTHER ANGLE Mary turns in small circles. ,2
Fear mounting as she falters into darkness. ,2
Heavy, labored BREATHING fills the tunnel. ,2
A mask -- the pale, neutral features of a man weirdly distorted by the rubber -- materialized out of the void right behind her. ,1
Eerie under the lighted torches. ,2
END OF TUNNEL Jamie runs frantically. ,2
Methodical, heavy FOOTSTEPS behind her. ,2
She chances a look behind. ,17
The Shape is coming! Jamie vaults up a dark stairwell. ,1
A trap door above. ,2020
It won't budge. ,90100
Jamie frantically POUNDS against the hatch. ,2
The Shape mounts the stairs! Strength fueled by sheer desperation, Jamie forces the door open. ,1
Tumbles onto muddy ground. ,2
EXT. WOODS - NIGHT Jamie drags herself out of the hole and half-runs, half-stumbles with her baby through an ugly, charred forest. ,2
Sharp branches whip at her face. ,2
RAIN falls. ,586000
LIGHTNING streaks across the sky. ,3410
As if hell-spawned, the Shape emerges from the underground chamber and trudges forward, bold and unstoppable. ,2
Jamie tumbles into a gully, nearly dropping the knapsack. ,1
She picks herself up, hands groping at rain-sopped earth. ,2
Harry Simms keeps him mindlessly occupied. ,2
HARRY SIMMS (V.O.) Next up is Dwayne. ,2
What's on your feeble excuse for a mind, "Dwayne?" The Motorisft lets out a hardy GUFFAW, spilling his coffee. ,1
MOTORIST Shit! Fingers burning, he searches the glove compartment for a napkin. ,3
DWAYNE (V.O.) I'd just like to say that I listen to your show every night, Harry. ,2
I think you're the best. ,26
I can't tell you how excited we are that you'll be paying a visit to our little town tomorrow night. ,2
HARRY SIMMS (V.O.) Do you have a point to make here, Dwayne, or should I just keep practicing my wrist exercises? ,2
DWAYNE (chortles) Harry, you're too much. ,1
I'd just like to say that I understand how things have changed in the 90's. ,1
Gays in the military, cut off your husband's do- jigger, become a national hero. ,2
But I just can't see any sense in bringing Halloween back to Haddonfield. ,2
The Motorist looks up. ,5
Eyes go wide with panic. ,1150
Startled GASP. P.O.V. ,29600
THROUGH WINDSHIELD Jamie stands in the middle of the road, SCREAMING bloody-murder. ,198000
EXT. WOODED ROAD / INT. PICKUP TRUCK (SAME) Tires SCREECH. The pickup stops on a dime. ,2
The Motorist just sits there, mouth agape as the shrieking girl throws open the door and clambers into the passenger seat. ,2
JAMIE Drive! Goddamnit, drive! Through his side-view mirror, the unsuspecting Motorist sees the outline of a quickly-approaching man. ,1
Unrolling his window, he rubbernecks a look outside. ,1
Slams her foot down hard on the gas. ,1
ANOTHER ANGLE The pickup bullets forward, fishtailing up the road, never slowing down as the driver's door flies open, dumping the motorists's headless bulk into a muddy ditch. ,1
INT. PICKUP (SAME) Jamie drives. ,1
Checks to see that her baby is safe. ,2
Then lets out a PRIMAL SCREAM. A hysterical release of fear and rage, drowned out by the squabble of VOICES over the radio: MALE CALLER #2 (V.O.) You're coming here for this Halloween fair -- it's all just a game -- a publicity stunt for you, isn't it Harry? ,589
These kids -- they're not old enough to remember what Myers did here. ,2
They look up to you. ,43
Now you're just asking for trouble. ,26
HARRY SIMMS (V.O.) You people really get me. ,1
What are they putting in the water in that town? ,3
CUT TO: INT. LOOMIS'S CABIN - NIGHT (SAME) LIGHTNING FLASHES and RAIN pelts the windows of a bucolic cabin. ,3700
This is a man's retreat and has been for years. ,1
Dark wood, worn leather, a few tastefully-chosen antiques. ,3
Floor-to-floor ceiling shelves containing a myriad of books and an impressive display of awards and degrees, all bearing the name: SAMUEL J. ,2
LOOMIS, Ph.D. ,2560
After a STATION IDENTIFICATION, "The Harry Simms Show" resumes, tinny-voiced CALLERS blaring over a handsomely-restored 1928 Bremer-Tully. ,1
MALE CALLER #3 (V.O.) All these fanatics aside, Harry, I'd personally like to thank whoever did the masked one in. ,876000
Saved us tax-payers a lot of money in the long run. ,1
FEMALE CALLER #3 (V.O.) Yeah, that sucker's been dead for six years. ,1150000
It's about time they had a Halloween revival in this town. ,3
MALE CALLER #4 (V.O.) What happened to that psychiatrist of his? ,905000
Loomis, I think was his name. ,1
I heard the old quack was dead. ,19
Turning at the mention of his name is DR. LOOMIS himself, wearing spectacles, a comfortable sweater and his trademark goatee. ,1
For the first time ever, we actually see him smile. ,1
The burn scars on his face have all but faded away. ,1
Last traces of the horrid past. ,17500
LOOMIS Not dead. ,30
Just very much retired. ,487
Loomis hobbles to the desk and finishes cutting out a newspaper article. ,1
As he arranges the strips of paper in a leather-bound scrapbook, a sudden KNOCK at the door gives him a startle. ,2
WYNN Christ, what a night! Not even so much as a sign for five miles on that road! LOOMIS That's the whole idea of living in the country. ,1
I thrive on the seclusion. ,2
Wynn heads for the kitchen, rummaging through cabinets and drawers as Loomis dutifully wipes up his muddy trail. ,1
WYNN (O.S.) Don't tell me that the reviled Rasputin of Smith's Grove has grown complacent in his golden years. ,1
I don't buy it for a single second, Dr. Loomis. ,2
Loomis immediately senses that Wynn has an angle. ,2
LOOMIS And in all these years, I've never known you to make house calls, Dr. Wynn. ,2
Especially at this hour ... ,8220
Wynn returns with a bottle of Irish whiskey and two shot glasses. ,2
Thrusts one in Loomis's hand and begins to pour. ,2
WYNN Unlike you, Sam, I learned many years ago not to second-guess the motives of my fellow man. ,2
Remember what Freud said: 'Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.' Or, in this case, a drink is just a drink. ,20300
LOOMIS I hope you didn't come all the way out here in this storm just to quote Freud. ,124000
WYNN As always, your keen powers of perception astound me. ,2
And you're right. ,972000
I've come to celebrate. (raising his glass) After thirty-two years as Psychiatric Administrator, guess who has been named Smith's Groves new Chief of Staff. ,1
LOOMIS But surely Rogers isn't -- WYNN Retiring. ,1
Loomis is abruptly stunned and delighted by the news. ,2
LOOMIS Why -- congratulations! I can think of no one better suited for the position. ,1
The two old sparring partners drink to the occasion. ,2
But Wynn's angle soon comes to the helm. ,1
WYNN Of course, I need a new Administrator. ,1
Someone who can bring new life -- and some old blood, if you'll pardon the expression -- back to our program ... ,1
Loomis prepares himself for the bomb. ,2
WYNN (continuing) We need you, Dr. Loomis. ,1
LOOMIS You should know that it's not wise to play Halloween pranks on me. ,4
WYNN You're the only man for the job, Sam. ,432000
Things haven't been the same since you left. ,276000
I'm recruiting the best psychiatric team in the country. ,2
Old colleagues. ,62400
Loomis scratches his head and settles down into his comfortable easy chair, amused at the irony of Wynn's speech. ,2
LOOMIS Even after my stroke six years ago they practically had to hold a gun to my head to get me to retire. ,2990
Now things have changed. ,45100
I've changed. ,759000
The ghosts have been buried. ,14100000
Why on earth would I want to dig them up again? ,1
Loomis finally looks over at Wynn, surprised to find him standing at the desk, looking through his scrap book. ,1
WYNN Seems to me there's at least one ghost that's still lurking in your closet. ,2
We follow Wynn's gaze down toward the open page. ,1
A blazing tabloid headline: "MICHAEL MYERS - DEAD OR ALIVE?" SHOCK CUT TO: EXT. RURAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT Jamie's getaway truck ROARS around a bend, tearing up a deserted stretch of highway. ,15
The STORM rages. ,27800
INT. PICKUP (CONTINUOUS) Jamie strains to see as she drives through sheets of RAIN. Bone weary, fighting panic, holding one hand steady against the wheel, the other on the CRYING infant. ,2
JAMIE God ... ,3720
Help us, please ... ,537000
Something up ahead. ,7060
Jamie's face fills with expectancy. ,2
JAMIE'S P.O.V. - THROUGH WINDSHIELD A lighted sign appears out of the darkness. ,1
Glowing salvation. ,806
Familiar red-white-and-blue logo. "GREYHOUND." EXT. BUS DEPOT - NIGHT The pickup drives into the glow of orange vapor lights. ,2
SKIDS to a stop in a deserted parking lot. ,2
Jamie staggers out, cradling the knapsack as she runs toward the old depot. ,2
INT. BUS DEPOT - NIGHT Jamie blasts through double glass doors. ,2
But the bus station is devoid of life. ,2
Empty benches. ,10700
Blank ARRIVAL/DEPARTURE signboard. ,2
The low hum of vending machines. ,1
Jamie moves toward the ticket counter. ,2
A handwritten sign left by the attendant: "BACK IN 20." Shivering, holding her baby, Jamie enters an old-fashioned phone booth. ,2
Picks up the receiver and immediately dials 911. ,2
VOICE (V.O.) You have reached Haddonfield Emergency Services. ,1
Due to severe weather conditions, all circuits are momentarily busy. ,14
If this is not an emergency, please dial directly ... ,2210000
Jamie slams the phone down in terrified frustration. ,1
Suddenly she becomes aware of the radio program. ,1
So give me your best shot at 1-800-878-7274. ,1
That's 1-800-URTRASH! The STATION IDENTIFICATION cuts in. ,1
Jamie picks up the receiver and frantically dials the number. ,2
INT. LOOMIS'S CABIN - NIGHT (SAME) Wynn doesn't give up the sales pitch even as Loomis leads him to the door. ,1990000
The radio program still squawking in the b.g. ,2
WYNN But with Rogers and his house of hacks gone, you'd make the rules. ,1
Just think it over. ,21500000
LOOMIS Please try to understand, Terence. ,2
I've already made up my mind. ,66900
As Wynn continues to talk, his voice trailing off into nothingness, Loomis's attention is diverted to the VOICES on the radio. ,2
HARRY SIMMS (V.O.) So they're trying to kill you and your baby. ,1
Don't tell me. ,8070000
Your name also happens to be Rosemary. ,4
JAMIE (V.O.) (intense whisper) No -- please listen! They're coming ... coming for me and my baby. ,1
Loomis's eyes widen; a man possessed. ,2
HARRY SIMMS (V.O.) Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? ,2
Who's coming? ,33100000
JAMIE (V.O.) It's ... ,1
Michael ... (releasing) ... ,1180
Michael Myers! Loomis staggers. ,2
A lifetime of nightmares coming back to haunt him all at once. ,224000
INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (SAME) PRESS IN TIGHT ON TOMMY in bed. ,2420000
Listening through headphones. ,20500
Sitting upright. ,274000
Thunderstruck. ,1910000
JAMIE (V.O.) Somebody help me! Dr. Loomis, are you out there? ,3
INT. LOOMIS'S CABIN - NIGHT (SAME) Wynn watches with rapt attention as Loomis unlocks his safe and withdraws a metal case. ,1
He pops it open, revealing his trusted .357 Magnum and a box of cartridges. ,3
INT. BUS DEPOT - NIGHT (SAME) A bus has arrived. ,1
The ATTENDANT returns to his post. ,2
Jamie hangs up the phone, filled with trepidation as PASSENGERS file inside. ,1
Securing her baby in the knapsack, Jamie throws open the door. ,2
Suddenly the Tall Man steps in her path! TALL MAN Are you all right, young lady? ,1
Shaking uncontrollably, Jamie shrinks away. ,1
Backing down a narrow hall through the door marked "LADIES ROOM." INT. LADIES ROOM - NIGHT (SAME) Water runs into a grimy basin. ,1
Unable to contain her tears, she washes the newborn. ,2
Takes a roll of paper towels and tries to rub the triangular blood mark off his chest. ,2
Suddenly the lights go out. ,41200
Jamie gasps. ,1560
Clutching her baby, she turns off the faucet and melts into the darkness. ,2
The door CREAKS open. ,7470
FOOTSTEPS echo inside. ,207
JAMIE has locked herself inside one of the stalls. ,2
The FOOTSTEPS grow louder. ,1630
Jamie's eyes dart frantically. ,2
STALKING P.O.V. ,3
MOVING methodically past the row of stalls, pushing open each door, revealing that they are all empty. ,2
A CRASH from the last stall. ,2
P.O.V. moves toward it. ,1
RUSTLING and MOVEMENT inside. ,14
An open window above the toilet. ,4
Jamie is gone! EXT. BUS DEPOT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) Jamie trembles off a stack of crates piled beneath the window and dashes around the side of the depot. ,1
Suddenly the bus ROARS by, sending up a muddy wave as it pulls out, disappearing down the highway. ,1
Jamie moves swiftly across the parking lot, clutching the knapsack. ,1
She throws open the door of the pickup and jumps into the driver's seat. ,34500
INT. PICKUP - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) Slapping down the locks, Jamie thrusts the key into the ignition. ,2
The engine REVS to life. ,22
She guns it, peeling out of the parking lot. ,2
Back toward the highway. ,23200
She drives on, suppressing her tears, stealing glances at the knapsack bunched up on the passenger's seat. ,2
Then she turns and looks forward with concentrated attention. ,2
JAMIE'S P.O.V. ,38
A sign looms ahead: "Haddonfield Memorial Hospital - 10 Mi." BACK TO SCENE Jamie sighs with relief, steadying the wheel just as -- HIGHBEAMS flash on right behind her, a juggernaut roaring out of blackness! Jamie's eyes flood with terror. ,1
JAMIE'S P.O.V. - THROUGH WINDSHIELD The grill of a familiar white van shoots forward, SLAMMING violently against the pickup's rear bumper. ,1
JAMIE is jolted forward in her seat. ,2
Holding on the wheel with a white-knuckle grip as she's repeatedly hit from behind. ,2
EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT The unseen madman noses forward, veering sharply over the double yellow line, scraping sides with the truck. ,2
Headlights sear a path through the night, locked in neck-and-neck profile. ,2
SPARKS flashing at 70-miles-per-hour. ,2770000
The van forces Jamie onto the shoulder. ,2
It leaves the road, tearing branches from trees. ,2
A pumpking patch. ,8480000
The van reappears in a glare of headlights. ,2
Its engine screaming with fire-breathing rage. ,370000
The pickup puts on a furious burst of speed. ,10100
Eating up pumpkins and spinning out chunks of splattering seeds and pulp. ,2
The van bears down hard, slingshotting across the field, whizzing past the pickup, cutting right in front of it. ,1
INT. PICKUP Something heavy is thrown from the back of the van right through the windshield! Glass EXPLODES! Jamie SCREAMS, hands going up instinctively to protect her face. ,2
Swerving wildly out of control. ,17
She looks to see a sprawling, mutilated corpse on top of her. ,2
Wide, cold, lifeless eyes -- Mary! JAMIE No!!! EXT. PUMPKIN PATCH (CONTINUOUS) The pickup rockets at breakneck speed toward the edge of the field. ,1
Suddenly -- JAMIE'S P.O.V. ,1
The Shape stands in the field, tall and unmoving, white mask glowing hideously in the rush of oncoming headlights. ,1
BACK TO SCENE The truck plows into the Shape, dragging it under, SLAMMING headlong into the trunk of a huge oak tree. ,1
Everything is abruptly and shockingly silent. ,2
Like a phantom in the night, the van is gone. ,292000
The Shape nowhere to be seen. ,139000
Steam billows from the pickup, engine TICKING, a heap of shattered glass and mangled steel. ,1
Pinned against the base of the tree is a shape in human form -- a scarecrow! MOVE IN on Jamie, face-down against the steering wheel. ,1
Coughing on the noxious fumes, she stirs back to life. ,2
Slowly, painfully, she shoulders the door. ,2
Falls onto the ground. ,61200
A SPARK ignites. ,10500
BLINDING FLASH as the gas tank EXPLODES, setting the truck ablaze. ,1
Jamie turns, her face a frozen rictus of horror. ,1
Debris rains down on her. ,6
Suddenly a grim shadow rises from the field. ,2
Only a roll of paper towels from the bus depot. ,2
THE SCARECROW burns; mocking Jamie with its grinning, hand-painted face. ,2
SLOW DISSOLVE TO: THE SHAPE looks at us, white mask scintillating against blinding rays of SUNLIGHT. Rivulets of blood drip off a large carving knife. ,1
PULLING BACK, we see it is a life-sized, knife-wielding effigy of Michael Myers, sitting astride the "For Sale by Strode Realty" sign. ,2
Stage blood spells out the words: "He's coming!" EXT. MYERS HOUSE - MORNING (CONTINUOUS) John Strode looks up with disgust as he inspects the grim monument that's been left on his front lawn during the night. ,2
Puffing on a cigarette, wearing slippers and a flimsy bath robe, John raises a large axe. ,1
A group of neighborhood KIDS -- some dressed in Halloween costumes -- stand a safe distance away. ,1
Gathered on the sidewalk. ,23600
Gawking, whispering, tittering. ,2
John angrily swings the axe into the signpost. ,24800
The kids jump with a collective start. ,1
JOHN Enough ... (one CHOP) ... of this ... (two CHOPS) ... ,1
Michael Myers ... (timber) ... shit! Suddenly the sign crashes down -- and "Michael Myers" with it. ,1
The kids huddle. ,1350
John turns on them, brandishing the axe. ,1
JOHN (continuing) You stinkin' kids got three seconds to get the hell off my property! One, two -- That's all it takes. ,1
The kids scatter, tripping over one another as they tear off down the black. ,1
Satisfied with himself, John stubs out his cigarette and hauls the sign and its now-headless rider to the trash. ,1
Then he trudges up the porch steps, dropping the axe as he enters the house. ,1
Uttering oaths under his breath. ,24
BOOM UP over the surrounding neighborheed. ,1
SUPERIMPOSE: "Haddonfield, Illinois. ,296
Halloween." Last night's storm has given way to an incredibly bright and picturesque morning. ,9090
CHILDREN pour out of their homes, bursting with excitement, dressed in colorful costumes. ,1
Even the Myers house, with its trimmed hedges and fresh coat of paint, somehow manages to look invite. ,1
A white van slowly rolls up the street. ,1
WKNB logo, streamers and a large orange banner proclaiming: "HADDONFIELD JUNIOR COLLEGE HARVEST FAIRE '95 - See Harry Simms Live - October 31." A now-familiar voice booms over loudspeaker: HARRY SIMMS (V.O.) This is Hard Harry Simms harping on ya from the Big Apple. ,3
Tonight's the night and the place to be is the First Annual Harvest Faire. ,1
So come on out of your broom closets, 'Fielders, and bogey the night away with me. ,1
MALE CALLER #4 (V.O.) Harry, I just won first prize for ugliest costume! Guess who I'm dressed as. ,903000
HARRY SIMMS (V.O.) Your mother? ,1
MALE CALLER #4 (V.O.) No, man -- You!!! EXT. SANITARIUM - MORNING A car bearing an official state emblem stops outside an imposing curtain of security gates. ,907000
A large sign reads: "SMITH'S GROVE - WARREN COUNTY SANITARIUM." A hand reaches out and waves a plastic key card in front of an infrared scanner. ,1
Surveillance cameras perched on the walls. ,1
As the gate yawns open and the car drives through, we SEE the asylum in the distance -- the entire perimeter bounded by woods and barbed wire fences. ,3
INT. WYNN'S CAR (CONTINUOUS) Wynn drives. ,1
Loomis in the passenger seat, fueling his own anxieties. ,1590
LOOMIS It was her voice. ,1
On the radio. ,7560000
It was Jamie. ,48400
Calling for me. ,904000
WYNN You don't know that for sure. ,1
It could have been anyone. ,98800
A practical joke. ,176000
LOOMIS It was Jamie Lloyd. ,29
And whatever has brought her back has brought Michael back as well. ,1
WYNN After six years? ,4
Sam, she died with him in that explosion after the -- LOOMIS That's what someone wants us to believe, but I tell you Michael is alive. ,1
I feel him. ,113000
I sense the evil that lives inside, just as I did all those years as I watched him. ,1
Sitting behind these very same walls. ,1
Staring. ,12600000
Growing stronger. (off Wynn's silence) As my colleague, as my friend, please. ,1
I can't go through this again. ,69400
Not alone. ,10100000
I need your help to stop him. ,7
Wynn stares. ,18
Loomis's words fall on him like a death sentence. ,18800000
INT. SANITARIUM - RECEPTION AREA (SAME) Gold insignia on mahogany doors: "TERENCE WYNN - CHIEF OF STAFF." Wynn and Loomis stride through a plush reception area. ,1
DAWN, an attractive, high-energy secretary, keeps pace, taking notes, handing Wynn his briefcase, phone messages, etc. ,1
WYNN Cancel all my appointments. ,1
Get Dr. Loomis anything he needs -- files, tests, records of every treatment ever administered to a former patient of ours -- Michael Myers. ,1
DAWN (stunned) Michael Myers? ,1
Wynn stops abruptly before heading out the door. ,1
WYNN That's right. ,3140000
We think there's a very good chance he might still be alive. ,1
Loomis acknowledges Wynn's silent understanding. ,1
CORRIDOR Wynn and Loomis move along a sterile white corridor. ,1
Wynn uses his key card to BUZZ them through a series of metal security cages. ,1
A retinue of DOCTORS and NURSES fall in behind. ,1
WYNN (continuing) Notify Haddonfield's sheriff; tell him we're on our way. ,1
I want the entire staff on alert. ,1
We go to code red lockdown for twenty-four hours. (beat) If he is alive, I plan on bringing him back. ,2
LOOMIS Or what's left of him. ,1
They cut down a sub-passageway and out a fire exit. ,1
EXT. SANITARIUM - LANDING FIELD (CONTINUOUS) Loomis and Wynn dash across a windswept field where a Smith's Grove medical transport helicopter awaits them. ,1
The deafening WHINE of spinning rotors as a TECHNICIAN refuels. ,1
The doctors step inside. ,1
The doors close and the helicopter lifts off, rising high above the cluster of the white coats below. ,1
TIM Bro', I knew Harry when we lived in the city. ,1
Don't worry -- he'll be there. ,29
We've got everything arranged. ,1390
Get with me tonight at the fair and I'll hook you up. ,1
Peace. ,16900000
Tim hangs up, guzzling down his shake as Debra navigates around him, setting out the breakfast dishes as Kara tries to study. ,1
John, dressed in what might be a respectable business suit if it fit him better, mutters grumpily as he pours himself a cup of coffee. ,1
JOHN Shitheads ... ,1
Defacing my property. ,1840
I showed them ... ,158000
DEBRA Relax, John. ,1
They were just kids. ,99800
JOHN Kids are what's ruining this country. ,1
Everywhere you go, it's the same. ,21
No goddamn respect. ,502
Tim lets out a huge BELCH as he finishes drinking his breakfast. ,1
JOHN (continuing) See what I'm talkin' about? ,1
DEBRA You'll never pass that exam on an empty stomach, Kara. ,1
Debra snatches the book out of Kara's hands. ,1100000
DEBRA (continuing; reading) Cognitive Therapy and Emotional Disorders? ,1
What are they teaching in college these days? ,21
The art of going crazy? ,11
KARA (indignant) It's called psychology, Mom. ,1
Living in this house is what's driving me crazy. ,82500000
JOHN Who the hell told you to come live here in the first place? ,1
Kara rises, collects her books, trying to avoid a confrontation. ,1
KARA I'd better get Danny to school. ,1
JOHN She don't show her face for five years, then expects us to roll out the red carpet. ,1
You think going to college is gonna make up for your mistakes, girl? ,4
DEBRA John, please don't -- TIM Yo', just lay off her, Dad. ,87000
Suddenly Danny runs in, showing off in his dinosaur costume. ,1
ROARING loudly. ,6230
Startling John. ,2380
JOHN What the fuck -- Kara immediately seizes Danny's hand and ushers him toward the back door. ,1
KARA Let's go, Danny. ,2
DEBRA Kara, wait. ,1
Can't we all just sit down? ,7
KARA I'm sorry, Mom. ,1
Debra reaches into her purse and hands Kara a couple of dollars. ,1
JOHN That's it, Debra, keep slipping her the cash. ,359000
While you're at it, why don't you just give her all our goddamn money?! John explodes, dumping the entire contents of her purse onto the floor. ,1
Debra recoils. ,15
Kara steps in. ,5070
Danny is terrified. ,3180
KARA Stay away from her, you bastard. ,25100000
JOHN (re Danny) I only see one bastard in this house. ,1
Kara flies at him with Medea-like rage. ,253000
John instantly grabs her by the neck and shoves her violently against the counter. ,1
TIM Dad! Let her go! DEBRA John! Stop it! Stop it! Danny looks outside. ,1
Frozen in horror. ,25000
A VOICE whispers. ,6990
WHISPERING VOICE (V.O.) Kill him, Danny ... ,1
Kill him ... ,2190000
Danny moves across the kitchen. ,1
Mesmerized. ,829000
Through the screen door, the Shape can be seen standing in the back yard. ,1
Kara's eyes bulge as John squeezes her throat. ,1
Choking her. ,131000
JOHN You ever raise your hand to me again, I'll kill you, you understand? ,1
John looks down to see the tip of a butcher knife pointed at his groin. ,1
Danny is holding it -- his eyes dark, emotionless. ,1
Ever so slowly, John releases Kara. ,1
Debra and Tim watch in horrified astonishment. ,1
Suddenly there's a KNOCK at the back door. ,7
Kara dives toward Danny. ,1
The knife clatters to the floor as she picks him up, grabs her book bag and hurtles outside. ,1
EXT. MYERS HOUSE - BACK YARD (CONTINUOUS) BETH, 19, very "retro," cute in the waifish sense -- milky white skin, two-tone hair and a dangling nose ring --is nearly bowled off the back porch as Kara and Danny fly out the door. ,1
BETH Make way for the Hardin County Express. (following them across the yard) Hey, where's Tim? ,1
We're supposed to go over the list of events for tonight -- Beth is taken aback when she sees the bruise on Kara's neck. ,1
BETH (continuing) He do that to you? ,1
KARA Another episode of 'Daddy Knows Best' at the Strode house. ,1
BETH Pig. ,5170
What the hell happened this time? ,6
Suddenly Tim jumps out from behind a clothesline, locking his arms around Beth, attacking her with kisses. ,1
BETH (continuing) Hold on, hot lips. ,1
We got work to do. ,743000
TIM Shit, Beth, why do we have to be the ones to organnize this friggin' fair? ,1
It's only Halloween. ,321000000
Beth shoves the clipboard at him, a champion of her cause. ,1
BETH How many times o I have to tell you? ,1
It's not about Halloween. ,20800
It's about being political. ,6
There are too many people with corn-cobs up their ass in this town telling us what we can and can't do. ,1
If we want change, it's up to us to set an example. ,1
INT. MYERS HOUSE - KITCHEN (SAME) Debra is on the floor, stifling her tears, putting things back in her purse. ,1
John stares coldly out the window. ,1
JOHN I want her and that kid out of here tonight. ,1
Debra rises, facing him scornfully. ,1
DEBRA I thought inheriting your father's house ... the business ... moving out here might change things. ,1
But you're still the same, John. (with finality) Kara has come home, and I'll be damned if I let you turn her away again. ,1
Debra storms off. ,10
John bores holes into her with his eyes. ,1
EXT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE (SAME) Tim lifts Danny into the back seat of Beth's convertible VW Bug -- plastered with "Greenpeace" and "This is Your Brain on Drugs" bumper stickers. ,1
Kara and Beth in front. ,2730000
TIM Whatever happened to women in back? ,702000
BETH Reality check, dillweed. ,1
This is 1995. ,39600
Pulling away from the curb, Beth honks at MRS. BLANKENSHIP, at least 80, owner of the student boarding house across the street. ,1
BETH (continuing) See you tonight, Mrs. ,152000
Blankenship! The old woman just stares forward. ,190000
A gardem hose in hand as she waters a garden of long-dead flowers. ,56500
Kara shields her eyes, distracted, looking up at the old Victorian house. ,1
KARA'S P.O.V. ,29
Beth drives down a shady, tree-lined avenue, unaware of the white van that is following them. ,1
KARA Beth, who's that guy that lives across the hall from you? ,402000
BETH Why? ,7810
You interested? ,4650000
KARA No! I keep seeing him staring out his window. ,100000
Watching me. ,1520000
BETH You mean Tommy. ,1
Yeah, on the weirdness scale he's about an eleven. ,1
Supposedly some scary shit happened to him when he was a kid. ,20
Messed up his head. ,20
He's harmless, though. ,2600
Probably just lonely. ,4550
Tim leans forward, ravaging Beth's neck. ,12100
TIM Or horny. ,7
KARA Tim, do you always have to act like such an asshole? ,1
TIM Only when you're around to dump on ... ,1
Hey, chill, sis. ,20
I'm just doggin' ya. ,6
Suddenly the van ROARS by and cuts them off. ,1
Beth lays on the HORN. Slams on the brakes. ,222000
Narrowly avoiding a collision. ,4050
BETH Speed kills, asshole! Suddenly the van swerves around to face the VW head on. ,1
For a breathless moment the van and the VW sit at opposite ends of the intersection. ,1
Idling. ,1570000
A tense stand-off. ,50100
KARA Who is that ... ,6
Kara strains to get a look at the van's driver. ,1
A momentary glimpse of a pale white face behind the wheel. ,1
BETH (bravely) I've got my pepper spray. ,1
Danny sits frozen in the back seat. ,89000
Kara looks back at Danny. ,242000
He returns her frightened gaze. ,1
Dark circles under his eyes. ,19300
Don't tell me. ,8020000
Your name also happens to be Rosemary. ,4
HARRY SIMMS (V.O.) Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? ,2
Who's coming? ,2960000
JAMIE (V.O.) It's ... ,21600000

Eerie. ,5370000
JAMIE (V.O.) (continuing; slowed) It's ... ,17600000

The "Greyhound" sign looms ahead. ,2
Tommy makes a beeline for the entrance, cowboy boots splashing through rain puddles. ,3940
A cross-eyed ATTENDANT greets him. ,1
ATTENDANT Can I help you, sir? ,363
TOMMY Can you tell me if a bus arrived from Russellville last night? ,256000
ATTENDANT Sure did. ,36
About seven hours ago. ,36800

A hole in the wall behind the toilet. ,6120
TOMMY Jesus ... ,3460

No one there. ,540000

LOOMIS It's a sign. ,2
He's come home. ,1600000
LOOMIS Please. ,5270
I need to see the sheriff. ,2
WYNN Official business. ,39000
The Deputy gives them a vexed glance. ,1
DEPUTY Wait here. ,89200
They told me you'd be coming. ,17
You people got no business in my town. ,1
LOOMIS Michael Myers is my business. ,18
The last thing we need is you spouting off your ghost stories. ,1
Skin pasty-white. ,211000
Lips blue from shock. ,2
LOOMIS Dear God ... ,28
A buzz of excitement fills the autumn air. ,1
TIM Yo, check it out. ,2
KARA I can't find my term paper. ,1
I do it all the time. ,2490000
Works primo. ,3090
Armed with her clipboard, Beth is assailed by her COMMITTEE. Inundating her with QUESTIONS. BETH Give us victory or give us death. ,1270
She picks it up, startled by what she sees. ,841000
Knives piercing them. ,2480000
Blood dripping. ,186000
Mouths screaming. ,4970

TOMMY I need to see a doctor. ,1
NURSE What seems to be the problem? ,15500
TOMMY I-it's a baby -- my baby. ,581000
NURSE What kind of an accident? ,757000
The shrill sound of Wynn's beeper. ,2
He clicks it. ,4350
WYNN (continuing) I'll be right back. ,790000
LOOMIS Yes? ,5470
You heard her, didn't you? ,28
It was Jamie. ,55600

Loomis tries to stop him. ,20
Wynn. ,12500000
WYNN There you are. ,2
Who was that boy? ,723000
LOOMIS An old friend. ,4
Clumsily picks it up and slides it through the top of the crate she is holding. ,1
Slowly she descends the rickety staircase. ,2
Suddenly the washing machine stops. ,1
Lifts the lid. ,22000000
DEBRA Great. ,4200
She turns, startled. ,1290
The front door is standing wide open. ,48

Okay, okay, Kyle. ,990000
You like that name? ,764000
The baby CRIES harder. ,18
TOMMY (continuing) This is worse for me than it is for you. ,961000
But the old woman keeps walking, oblivious to it all. ,2030000
The crying stops. ,4840
Don't you worry. ,1070000
I'm gonna take care of you. ,205000
LOOMIS Michael Myers was just six-years-old when he stabbed his sister to death in 1963. ,3
Here in this house. ,336000
For the next fifteen years, I became obsessed with finding out what was living inside of him. ,2770000
I knew what he was but I never knew why. ,23
Driving him. ,234000
The mark of Thorn. ,17900
Lunch money on the ground. ,1
High stakes indeed. ,1820
Ian glowers. ,9
Easy money. ,3090000
The showdown begins. ,6590
LOOMIS He crept up these stairs and made his way into this room. ,3
His sister's room. ,162000
Where it all began. ,896000
LOOMIS This house is sacred to him. ,4

LOOMIS Mrs. ,3260
Suddenly he barrels into the outstretched hands of a towering shape. ,1
An "OPEN" sign on the front door. ,99700
MOANS of ecstasy resound along the street, attracting the attention of the mid-day passerby. ,32400
Get ready. ,13400000
Some people laugh. ,153000
Others wince in disgust. ,5
And you better be there. ,234000
Tonight. ,22300000
Let's do it together. ,629000
Business is obviously slow. ,28
Something terrible has happened. ,47000
INTERCUT their conversation. ,12
A psychiatrist by the name of Loomis. ,4
In our house. ,2390000
DEBRA I'm getting the children out of here. ,1
At least until we know what we're dealing with. ,9350000
JOHN (whispers) Debra, you're fuckin' insane. ,92000
DEBRA You knew, didn't you, John? ,7740000
You knew. ,3580000
A CLICK as the line suddenly goes DEAD. John scowls, opens his lower desk drawer, produces a bottle of JD and a small glass. ,11300
She accidentally knocks a family portrait off a bureau. ,19800
Lets out a horrified gasp. ,690
Into the living room. ,2490000
Picks up the phone. ,637000
DEBRA Hello? ,3560
A startling, intensely whispering VOICE: WHISPERING VOICE (V.O.) We want the child ... ,783000
Terror paralyzing her. ,56
MUFFLED, HEAVY BREATHING fills the room. ,1
DEBRA Oh, God ... ,18
In her panic, she can't release the chain lock. ,1
Through the kitchen. ,2630000
Flings open the back door. ,1290
White sheets twist around her like ghosts in the blustering WIND. She tosses them aside, one after the other. ,1
Approaching the driveway. ,32600
Safety up ahead. ,72400000
Her eyes bug. ,5830
Too late to scream. ,1620000
Rides assembled. ,3180
Paper witches hang from broomsticks. ,2
Goblins lurk behind syrofoam gravestones. ,2
Donning costumes. ,5690
EXT. STREET (SAME) Kara walks past the crows of "Harry-ites" gathered outside the campus gates, now extending half-way around the block. ,14500
Kara ambles up the walk of the Myers house, shoes clapping up the porch steps as she digs the keys out of her overstuffed bag. ,1870
Unbolting the door, she finds that it's secured with the chain-lock. ,1
Puzzled, she steps off the porch and makes her way around the side of the house, CAMERA FOLLOWING as she peers into the windows along the way. ,1
She reaches the back door. ,2
Standing ajar. ,3710

Her mother's suitcase still sitting there. ,341000
Beyond, the cellar door stands wide open. ,1
A sudden CRASH from upstairs. ,29
KARA (continuing) Mom? ,1450000

An orange glow flickers around the edges of the closed door. ,1

KARA Who the hell are you? ,2
It's Tommy. ,257000
My name's Tommy. ,6450
Tommy Doyle. ,38400
Where's my mother? ,894000

Eyes lolling. ,2830
Succumbing. ,505000
Cold, staring FACES. Flashing lights on a wall panel: "3-2-1-B" -- an elevator. ,64300

A switchblade FLICKS open. ,4
The LIGHTS of the fair twinkle in the distance, bright and beckoning. ,1
Rallying against the celebration. ,2

LOOMIS Good. ,2200
And I'm not about to stand by and watch you turn this night into some kind of sadistic witch hunt. ,1
You'd better get over there right away. ,1
What's happened to Jamie? ,25
Loomis tears off. ,1
Crushes it under his boot and slowly follows him. ,90900
Polished wood. ,184000
Framed old paintings. ,5950
Wall-to-wall Tiffany lamps. ,100000
But Danny is undaunted. ,1000
Kara is repulsed by the sight of Tommy's musty, unkempt apartment. ,2260
You can see everything from this window. ,40000
Who am I supposed to be looking for? ,100000
TOMMY Him. ,1790
DANNY Come on, Mom. ,10
We're gonna miss all the fun stuff! KARA (snapping) Danny, you're just going to have to wait! Danny plods off. ,10400
Their eyes lock for a beat. ,3
He takes it. ,284000
TOMMY Shhh. ,284
It's okay, Kyle. ,3780
There you go, big guy. ,8080
Despite his clumsiness, she's undeniably moved. ,3320000
On the floor. ,7690000
Across the windowsill. ,49000
Glancing across the street. ,2280
Looking right at Danny. ,1120
KARA Here. ,7200

LOOMIS Jamie ... ,3600
I failed you again. ,73200000
I never should have left you. ,63000
He spins, pouncing on Sheriff Holdt. ,2770
Pulls him away. ,31100
The sheriff doesn't budge. ,1
WYNN Don't do this to yourself, Sam. ,2
WYNN What is it? ,19
DR. BONHAM I'm very sorry ... ,1
How could you? ,6770000
LOOMIS God in heaven. ,1
Kara paces, rocking the baby, feeding him with the bottle. ,3010
They were symbols -- carved out of stone or pieces of wood. ,11
Of all the runes, Thorn had the most negative influence. ,4
He bolts toward the door. ,5
Finds it standing wide open. ,2
A bowl of popcorn between them. ,6420
A blank, hollow stare. ,21
He hears the voice. ,265000
Leaving her alone with the children. ,8
Taillights disappearing. ,1550
The Shape watches. ,1390
INT. GARAGE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) The car parks. ,1
Sits in silence. ,50000
John spills out, collar unbuttoned, tie dangling. ,9970
Picking himself up, he staggers out of the garage. ,1
Laughing. ,14200000
Singing. ,19700000
JOHN ... ,25100000
Pretty woman, walking down the street ... ,13800
Pretty woman, the kind I'd like to meet. ,24600
He turns the knob -- but the door's jammed. ,1
Chain-locked. ,10500
JOHN (continuing) What the fuck ... (yelling inside) ... ,57300
One ... ,148000000
Two ... (still no response) ... ,33
Two and a half ... ,5400000
It doesn't budge. ,103000
Strains for lucidity. ,2
No one in the kitchen. ,21
Opens the lid on a pasta cooker. ,1
Nothing inside. ,184000
JOHN (continuing; mutters) Work all day and not even any supper ... ,22500000
Then he flounders down the dark alley, knocking picture frames awry. ,1
Bewildered. ,995000
Then he switches on a lamp, kicks off his shoes and crashes onto his lumpy old recliner. ,12000
JOHN All right ... ,15700
You can all come out now ... ,25
Still no reply. ,92000
INSERT - TELEVISION A scene from another horror movie. ,1
A boy shreds his pumpkin mask as a mass of beetles and snakes pour out of his skull. ,1
BACK TO SCENE JOHN What is this shit? ,4430000
Disgusted, he switches channels to the local NEWS. A shrill BEEP from the kitchen startles him. ,1
The microwave. ,2680000
Then he reaches for the microwave, opens it. ,1
Spinning around, he sees the piping hot entree already sitting out on the kitchen table. ,1
John double-takes, mentally retracing his steps. ,1
Shrugs. ,1390000
FOLLOW JOHN as he picks up his tray and plods back down the hall. ,2190000
Keep it up all night ... ,754000
SCREAMS from the television. ,31
He reacts. ,182000
INSERT - TELEVISION Someone has switched it back to the horror movie. ,1
Out of the corner of his eye, he catches a shadowy figure darting by in the darkened foyer. ,1
It stands open. ,2350
An invitation to enter. ,483000
I'm really scared. ,7250000
Barefoot. ,13500000
The flashlight beam preceding his every step. ,1
A RUMBLING below. ,355000
Now flooding the entire floor. ,1
John SLOSHES through the water toward the washing machine -- which is running at full tact. ,34100
Sparks wain from the wall. ,55200
Suddenly the entire house is plunged into darkness. ,7
INT. MYERS HOUSE - CELLAR (SAME) John's toes curl. ,83100
The skin around where the knife penetrates FRIES. The Shape steps back, head tilted, BREATHING steadily, curiously observing John's hanging, lifeless body. ,3670
CUT TO: EXT. HARVEST FAIR - NIGHT Tommy grabs the ticket he's just paid for, hands it to an ATTENDANT and moves through the turnstiles amid a steady stream of REVELLERS. Loud MUSIC, the aroma of apple cider and pumpkin pie fills the air. ,74
Children carving jack-o'-lanterns. ,10900
Parents beaming with pride. ,1200
Ducking for apples. ,5200
Totally raw. ,34600
Not only for Haddonfield, but for every town in the nation. ,17800
Rows of deserted houses. ,1310
Not a soul in sight. ,104000
Preternatural stillness. ,1970
Flames CRACKLE in the fireplace, casting weird shadows. ,1
KARA Mrs. ,2770
Lost in her own world. ,48000
Blankenship, please. ,6860
This is important! Mrs. ,28
Looking past it. ,9730
A light RAIN begins to fall. ,7460
A sign reads: COSTUME PAGEANT. Tommy reacts to a terrified SCREAM. Just a couple of teenage BOYS pulling an innocuously fightened GIRL onto another ride. ,2
More people pass. ,45600
There was something very sinister about that man. ,10000
Tommy surges forward. ,8
The Stranger walks faster. ,6730000
Gaining ground. ,415000
Toward the Halloween tree. ,550000
Suddenly SIRENS. Squad cars converge. ,1
Weapons trained. ,6500
Puts his arms up in surrender. ,107000
TOMMY Stop that man! He's the one! ANGLE ON FERRIS WHEEL Beth and Tim exit the ride and follow the crowd toward the flashing LIGHTS of the police cruisers. ,41400
BETH Jesus, that's my neighbor. ,1420000
Tommy. ,16500000
There's nothing else for us to do here. ,30000
TIM But they're gonna light the tree in a few minutes -- BETH (suggestively) We can light our own tree at home. ,671000
She brushes against Tim's crotch and saunters away. ,100
Same as his great- grandfather. ,4000
All Hallows Eve. ,313000
Then the townspeople burned him alive. ,1260000
People putting up umbrellas. ,494000
A STORM fast approaching. ,38
Waiting to make a presentation. ,100000
Prevailing upon the sheriff. ,2000
They move swiftly through the gaping crowd. ,1000
Tommy glances back. ,33000
His eyes drawn to something. ,10000
Grotesque and misshapen. ,2060
In the tree. ,4990000
Diving for it. ,106000
Fighting over it. ,87900
Sheriff Holdt sees what is happening and flies toward them in pursuit. ,52300
Parents' faces register shock when they see their children running toward them, SCREAMING hysterically, soaked with blood. ,1
Words cannot convey the horror in his eyes. ,10000
Just then, a BOLT OF LIGHTNING ignites the tree. ,10000
SPARKS flash. ,5430
Tommy helps the last of the kids off the stage when something falls from the gnarled branches: a dangling, rotating, wrapped-up thing. ,10400
The bloody corpse hanging from the tree. ,10000
People running, SCREAMING, carrying their children toward the exits. ,10000
Loomis right behind him. ,30000
Running toward home. ,3290
THUNDER rattles the old house. ,20000
It's just another storm. ,3660
Try to get some sleep. ,263000
DANNY I can't. ,122000
DANNY Promise? ,2600
Quickly she moves away from the window, heads out the door. ,10000
HALLWAY She KNOCKS loudly on the door across the hall. ,10000
She knocks again. ,2520
BETH (coming up for air) Guess they -- went to the fair after all. ,152000
She's feeling apprehensive. ,30000
Watching. ,31900000
We HEAR the phone RINGING on the other end. ,150000
INT. MYERS HOUSE - KARA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT Beth collapses with Tim onto Kara's bed. ,87800
TIM Answer what? ,190000
Frustrated, Tim jumps off the bed and stomps into the bathroom, taking a candle with him. ,35800
TIM Fine. ,6500
You answer it. ,227000
Tim slams the door. ,27
BETH (into phone) Hello? ,90000
No, this is Beth. ,19
KARA What are you doing there? ,3000
Where's my mother? ,840000
BETH He's in the bathroom. ,1000
He gasps. ,33100
Sitting by the window. ,142000
KARA I'm across the street. ,10000
I can see you. ,6710000
Beth, I want you to listen to me. ,20000
Get Tim and get out of that house. ,40000
Right now. ,29100000
Come to me. ,7520000
The Shape advances. ,756
BETH Kara, what the hell is going on? ,100
Her mind snaps into sensory overload. ,10000
Her eyes shoot down. ,30000
No, it can't be true. ,245000
Kara wheels around. ,10000
Danny is gone. ,6510
Disappearing inside. ,13800
Up the porch steps. ,126000
Right behind him. ,171000
INT. MYERS HOUSE - FOYER Kara dives through the front door. ,37
THUNDER shatters the house. ,100000
Everything is frighteningly dark. ,100000
Shockingly quiet. ,5210
Inch by inch, she makes her way inside. ,10000
Eyes wide. ,1610000
Savage. ,14600000
Shaking uncontrollably. ,63200
A CRASHING SOUND behind her. ,577000
She jumps out of her skin. ,190000
She advances into the hall. ,14400000
Old floorboards CREAK beneath her feet. ,2
SOUNDS up ahead. ,886
FOOTSTEPS. Kara looks up. ,1
Then suddenly she stops dead. ,50000
Reason taking over. ,3240
And she turns back. ,30
Picks up a fireplace poker sitting in the corner. ,1
Mind-blown with horror. ,1
Summoning all of her courage, she moves forward. ,1
Suddenly Danny darts out from the adjacent hall and disappears inside his bedroom -- a fleeting, ghostly image. ,12100
Kara startles. ,253
Follows him inside. ,6790
LIGHTNING illuminates his toy dinosaurs. ,2
He resists her. ,4020
Danny, please. ,15100
She picks him up, carries him toward the door. ,1
Eyes probing. ,3470
Walking right past them. ,2970
Cranes her neck to look down. ,2100
Kara SCREAMS. Drops Danny. ,1
Quickly covers her mouth. ,2920
Suddenly the bedroom door tears open, buckling off its hinges. ,1000
The Shape moves in, backing her through the bathroom ... into Danny's room. ,18600
It doesn't. ,8410000
Jumping at every sound. ,3550
Training her weapon at things unseen. ,10000
SLAMMING doors along the way, sealing off every passageway as she tries to find her way through the impenetrable dark tunnel. ,1
Suddenly something CRASHES down from above. ,10000
The Shape advances. ,765000
Swings the axe. ,8550
Misses her by inches. ,1290
Swings the fireplace poker with everything she's got. ,1000
The Shape doesn't move. ,213000
INT. MYERS HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY (SAME) Kara barrels off the stairs. ,14500
Sprawled face-up in the middle of the hall. ,1000
The little boy appears in the doorway directly across the hall. ,100
Danny shakes his head. ,1630
Too frightened to move. ,14100
Instantly she snatches Danny up in her arms. ,899000
She falls, splaying forward. ,3790000
Only one way to go. ,2650000
The cellar. ,1830000
A soul-shuddering POUNDING on the door above. ,1000
