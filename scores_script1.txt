He is clothed, open white shirt, khakis. ,235000
Dead. ,18700000
ALLEN (V.O.) And if you try to let them go... ,1110000
Suddenly, a breath: he comes back to life. ,1770000
David floats back to LUCIEN CARR, 20, (blonde, beautiful, shirtless and terrified), waist deep in the water. ,4490

David's body LIFTS into the young man's arms. ,654000
We see David's feet and hands are TIED together with shoelaces. ,131000

ALLEN (V.O.) They become part of who you are... ,293000
A stain of blood on David's chest shrinks, vanishes. ,99100
David's eyes OPEN. CUT TO: INT. THE TOMBS - DAY LUCIEN ...or they destroy you. ,197000
From behind the bars of a jail cell, Lucien Carr (the young man from the opening) finishes reading from a paper MANUSCRIPT in his hand. 2. ,27100
Lucien, furious, crumples it up. ,100000
LUCIEN You can't show this to anyone. ,148000000
We PULL BACK to reveal the author of the manuscript: a eighteen-year-old ALLEN GINSBERG. Unslept and exhausted. ,9510
But determined. ,182000
Allen stares defiantly at Lucien from the other side of the bars. ,11700
ALLEN Then tell the truth, Lu. LUCIEN You weren't even there. ,106000
It's your truth. ,7790000
It's fiction. ,555000
Allen grabs for his manuscript back, but Lucien pulls it out of reach. ,676000
LUCIEN You wanted him gone too. ,3
You sent him to me. ,520000
Allen reaches through the bars and SNATCHES the paper. ,281000
Lucien won't let go -- it's a tug of war between the two boys, two wills. ,42400
Allen yanks the paper from Lucien's grip and wins. ,8320
Lucien, panicking. ,5
LUCIEN (CONT'D) Please. ,8430
You'll kill me with that. ,296000
Allen turns and races towards the exit of the prison. ,204000
Desperate, Lucien calls out after him. ,14100
LUCIEN Allen! No! Allen doesn't turn. ,2080000
An alarm HAMMERS through the prison. ,143000
LUCIEN Allen! No! DON'T...! CUT TO BLACK. INSERT TITLE: KILL YOUR DARLINGS CUT TO: 3. ,40000
EXT. GINSBERG HOME - NIGHT SUPER: PATERSON, NEW JERSEY. 1943. ,31600
ONE YEAR EARLIER. Over a strip of working-class row homes, we hear the sounds of a radio announcer giving a dispatch from the war front. ,1070
RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.) American daylight bombers were busy again, as our liberators with fighter escort continue the air offensive with another sock at German coastal installations in France. ,5880
INT. GINSBERG HOME - NIGHT The radio continues playing to a modest home. ,1420000
We see a young man cleaning house, sweeping in the background. ,33500000
RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.) But the Germans report a big new red army push toward Romania. ,6960
This is World War news. ,128000
As the war report ends, a stuffy musical piece begins. ,835000
We hear a groan from the young man. ,213000
From out of the background emerges Allen Ginsberg (now 17, fresh-faced, horn-rimmed glasses, dutiful son). ,5220
The kind of kid who takes care of everything. ,7310000
He storms up to the radio, switches the station to a fast- paced boogie-woogie number. ,11300
He smiles and dances joyfully to the up-beat number with his broom. ,39300
The door slams. ,12000000
Allen looks up, caught in the act, to see his father LOUIS (40's, school teacher, Jewish working-class poet) home from work. ,35
Allen accidentally drops the broom. ,10100
LOUIS How was she today? ,6220000
Louis turns off the music. ,114000
The playful mood dies. ,94000
Allen spots the mail in his father's hand. ,143000
ALLEN Fine. ,57200
Anything for me? ,31000000
LOUIS Why? ,23200
You expecting something? ,7860000
Allen looks down, a bad liar. 4. ,47000000
ALLEN No. Suddenly, from upstairs, the sound of glass shattering. ,29500
Then a woman whimpering in pain. ,783000
Allen, worried, looks off, dread in his face. ,303000
His father just sighs. ,944000
LOUIS I told you it wouldn't work. ,1330000
Allen rushes upstairs. ,279000
INT. MASTER BEDROOM, GINSBERG HOME - NIGHT Allen runs into a dark room, flips on the light. ,82
ALLEN Mom? ,5290
His mother NAOMI (early 40's, Jewish, deep personality disorder) squats in the corner of the room, in a dirty bathrobe. ,1560
Her knuckles are bleeding. ,785000
NAOMI You've got to get me out of here. ,20700000
He nailed the windows shut while I was in the bath. ,549000
She motions to the shattered window pane across the room. ,34700
Allen sees her blood on the sill, where she tried to escape. ,62200
He moves towards her, to console her. ,107000
What he's good at. ,1580000
ALLEN Dad didn't do that. ,10800000
I nailed the windows. ,998000
Because you're not right. ,40800000
Naomi, in the midst of a paranoid attack, puts her finger to her mouth. ,55700
NAOMI Shhh...Allen. ,35200
He can hear you! Allen wraps his mother's hand with a dish towel. ,22500
Clear your head. ,7280000
Do you want to go back to Greystone? ,155000000
NAOMI He wouldn't dare put me back there. 5. ,4890000
ALLEN Then listen to me. ,29600
NAOMI SHHHH. He can hear you! She's losing it. ,117000
Allen quickly thinks, turns to her bureau. ,964000
He pulls out a RECORD, starts the phonograph and turns up the volume. ,24900
ALLEN Can he still hear me? ,65800000
A BRAHMS WALTZ plays. ,271000
NAOMI What did you say? ,900000
Allen turns the music up all the way. ,1360000
Allen mimes deafness. ,2920000
Finally, she understands: their sounds are drowned out by the music. ,40100
Allen reaches for her. ,3150000
She finally softens, takes his hand. ,3880000
As mother and son waltz together with the music, Naomi clutches Allen to her, like he's the only thing keeping her sane. ,5750
Because he is. ,4640000
NAOMI Don't ever leave me. ,1110000
Allen, trapped, over her shoulder. ,64800
From the doorway, we see that Louis has been watching the whole time. ,2780000
EXT. GINSBERG FRONT PORCH - NIGHT Overwhelmed, Allen shakes on the front stairs. ,3490
She's not well. ,6680000
The faint sound of jazz, fun from someone else's home from down the block. ,237000
Louis comes out onto the porch, with an open LETTER in hand from the mail pile. ,143000
He's upset. ,7020000
LOUIS Were you even going to tell me you applied?! Allen spies the "Columbia University" seal on the front. ,52500
He's been caught. ,621000
He looks down, ashamed. 6. ,696000
ALLEN I didn't want her to know. (beat) It was a dream anyway. ,4970000
Louis lights his own cigarette. ,15300000
Offers his son one. ,176000
He declines. ,444000
LOUIS (talking to himself, dreaming) Trilling's there. ,1580000
Van Doren. ,475000
English Professors. ,181000
Important fellows. ,1420
And New York City, right in your goddamn lap. ,518000
Louis sits beside his son. ,250000
LOUIS Love that is hoarded, molds at last. ,9310
Allen, surprised to hear his Dad reciting one of his poems. ,139000
LOUIS Until we know, the only thing we have-- ALLEN is what we give away. ,969000
LOUIS Is what we hand away. ,7950000
Have, hand. ,13600000
Consonance. ,796000
ALLEN Give, is. ,227000
Assonance. ,965000
LOUIS I wrote the goddamn poem. ,42500
Go write your own. ,305000
Louis hands over the letter. ,346000
The hardest thing he's ever done. ,695000
Allen takes the envelope, rips it open. ,13000
He's looking at the response in shock. ,1530000
Louis tries to read his son's face. ,6230000
ALLEN I got in. ,6040000
LOUIS You got in?! 7. ,49700000
ALLEN I got into Columbia University! LOUIS You got into Columbia University?! Allen and his father embrace. ,14900000
CUT TO: EXT. COLUMBIA QUAD - DAY First day of college. ,380000
Allen crosses the grand Ivy League campus in awe. ,66600
Before him, the staggering facade of the library like the Parthenon. ,357000
A troop of Navy midshipmen pass by. ,3900
Wartime is on. ,33
INT. ALLEN'S DORM ROOM - DAY Allen sets his bag on his bed. ,190000
He notices on one wall are patriotic posters, exercise posters. ,611000
He's already got a roommate. ,348000
He eyes a map of the New York City subway system. ,32100000
He can't believe he's really here in the big city. ,2110000
He walks over to it. ,151000
Allen studies the map, his finger gliding down to Greenwich Village. ,42800
LUKE (O.S.) You don't wanna go down there. ,1010000
His roommate LUKE, 18, buzz cut, in a sweaty Columbia sweatshirt, leans over him. ,13600
LUKE Land of the fairies. ,840000
Head there and you never come back. (extending a firm hand) Luke Detweiler, Danville, Virginia. ,22600
ALLEN Allen Ginsberg. ,540000
LUKE (bright smile) You're Jewish, right? ,373000
Allen nods. ,1090
Luke smacks him on the shoulder. 8. ,3620000
LUKE I'm getting good at telling. ,7600000
INT. LIBRARY, MAIN HALL - DAY The beautiful main hall of Columbia University's Butler Library. ,187000
It's Ivy League tradition meets thousands of years of scholarship. ,45700
A pompous TOUR GUIDE shows off museum-like glass vitrines to new and prospective students with their families. ,1600
TOUR GUIDE The South Hall library is a church, and these are the sacraments. ,280000
Allen stumbles along on the tour. ,28900
The tour guide points to the contents of the vitrines: the wonders of literary history. ,15900
TOUR GUIDE Original folios of the most important texts in history. ,195000
Beowolf. ,10900000
First folio Hamlet. ,224000
The Gutenberg Bible. ,6820000
Allen looks down, amazed. ,1180000
That's Shakespeare's handwriting. ,301000
TOUR These are among the University's most prized possessions. ,2270000
Suddenly, in a reflection in the glass, a flash of RED catches Allen's eye. ,15300
LUCIEN (O.S.) Let's hear a bit, shall we? ,308000
Allen turns to see Lucien Carr (now 19, devilish, stunningly handsome) LEAP onto a library desk with a book in hand. ,4
He wears a distinctive red CRAVAT that only the truly beautiful can pull off. ,401000
The entire room hushes. ,107000
LUCIEN (reciting) On a Sunday afternoon, when the shutters are down and the proletariat possesses the street... ,12100
The tour guide looks around confused. 9. ,1100000
LUCIEN ...there are certain thoroughfares which remind one of nothing less... ,183000
Lucien gets on his knees and THRUSTS a lamp between his legs. ,18500
LUCIEN ...than a big cancerous cock. ,23500
Parents look around in shock. ,66600
A female student is instantly aroused. ,32600
The prim PERMISSIONS LIBRARIAN clomps over. ,10300
PERMISSIONS LIBRARIAN What is this nonsense? ,3100000
LUCIEN Henry Miller. ,71800
PERMISSIONS LIBRARIAN Get down immediately. ,18200000
That book is restricted. ,18700000
LUCIEN Which is why I committed it to memory. ,30200
PERMISSIONS LIBRARIAN Security! As two Campus Security Guards rush in, Lucien leaps down in front of Allen. ,40700
LUCIEN Alert the press! Tell them Lucien Carr is innocent! Lucien flees, rushes out of the library. ,4690
TOUR GUIDE That was highly unusual. ,238000
Campus is actually quite quiet. ,414000
Moving on. ,11500000
But Allen doesn't hear, he grins to himself. ,1780000
Who the hell was that? ,64900
PROFESSOR STEEVES (V.O.) The Victorian sonnet has the balance of three tenets. ,28700
INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY Patrician, old-guard PROFESSOR STEEVES lectures on the first day of class, Allen dutifully taking notes in his journal. 10. ,57
PROFESSOR STEEVES Rhyme, meter, conceit. ,1630
Without this balance, a poem becomes slack, sloppy. ,400000
An untucked shirt. ,125000
Allen disagrees and raises his hand. ,12900
ALLEN Professor Steeves, then how do you explain Whitman? ,769000
No one interrupts Professor Steeves. ,45200
Murmurs from around the class. ,97700
Steeves locks down his gaze on Allen. ,238000
PROFESSOR STEEVES Say more. ,65500
Two more sentences. ,48300000
ALLEN He hated rhyme and meter. ,135000
The whole point was untucking your shirt. ,125000
Professor Steeves smiles to himself. ,18600
There's one of them every year. ,4180000
PROFESSOR STEEVES What's your name? ,181000000
ALLEN Allen Ginsberg. ,540000
PROFESSOR STEEVES Ginsberg? ,12100
Your father perhaps is the poet Louis Ginsberg? ,571000
Allen nods. ,1090
PROFESSOR STEEVES He writes rhyming, metered verse. ,18100
Why do you think he chose that form? ,10400000
All eyes on Allen. ,6350000
ALLEN Because it's easier. ,141000
The class titters. ,22300000
Professor Steeves hushes them. ,7
PROFESSOR STEEVES This university exists because of tradition and form. ,196000
Would you rather this building be built by engineers or Whitman and his boys at play? 11. ,115000
Allen, realizing he is trapped, unable to answer. ,6580000
Professor Steeves smiles victoriously and writes on the blackboard. ,16500
PROFESSOR STEEVES There can be no creation before imitation. ,1910000
The other students take note. ,50700000
Allen sighs, follows suit. ,28500
From the back row, Lucien watches Allen and unsheathes a grin. ,40400
INT. ALLEN'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT Luke, dressed in a suit, puts on cologne. ,12500
He looks back at Allen who is copying from a tome of sonnets. ,93400
LUKE Shut the books. ,1440000
We're taking my brother with us to the social. ,14800000
He ships out tomorrow. ,82800
ALLEN I can't. ,300000
You see how much I've got to do. ,3900000
LUKE He's Navy. ,2070000
It's catnip for the skirts. ,55000
Luke pulls out his own waistband and sprays some cologne down the front. ,4570000
Allen shakes his head. ,530000
Luke shrugs. ,2460
LUKE You hymies are really all about work, huh? ,34500000
Luke slams the door behind. ,103000
Allen, alone stares out the window. ,137000
A record starts up down the hall. ,8810000
Clarinet, strings. ,30600
Allen's ears prick up. ,107000
He knows this tune. ,213000
It's the same BRAHMS from his mother's bedroom. ,1870000
INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT Allen walks down a darkened hallway, the music leading him forward. ,36800
He reaches a door with a lit transom. ,171000
He knocks. ,194000
The unlocked door creaks open. 12. ,1130000
INT. LUCIEN CARR'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT A mattress lies on the floor, a phonograph on top. ,62600
Candles light the room. ,33700000
Books for furniture. ,10900000
And Lucien on the floor, reading the Times and smoking. ,913000
ALLEN Brahms? ,2100
Allen walks inside. ,1580000
Lucien looks up, surprised. ,7990000
LUCIEN Finally. ,1310
An oasis in this wasteland. ,182000
Nervous, Allen tries to make conversation. ,153000
ALLEN How come you're not at the social? ,6230000
LUCIEN Only the most anti-social have to go to an event actually called one. ,1680000
Libation? ,629000
Lucien rises and grabs a wine bottle corked with a sock. ,10800
Allen looks nervously towards the door. ,19200
ALLEN You drink in your room?! LUCIEN How does a horrible bottle of Chianti sound? ,14900
Lucien inverts two small glasses and pours. ,581000
Allen stares. ,75300
He doesn't break the rules. ,192000
ALLEN I don't drink. ,1710000
LUCIEN Freshman? ,13
ALLEN Yes. ,19700
Lucien hands him his glass. ,92500
LUCIEN Excellent. ,610
I love first times. ,12000000
I want my whole life to be composed of them. ,4890000
Life is only interesting if life is wide. 13. ,46300000
Lucien toasts Allen's glass. ,39200
LUCIEN To Walt Whitman, you dirty bastard. ,248000
Allen, mortified, not sure how to take that reference as Lucien knocks his wine back in one gulp. ,6680
LUCIEN How's your Yeats? ,1130000
Have you read A Vision? ,12200000
He tosses Allen a BOOK. Dog-eared, underlined and crumbling. ,5310
ALLEN Never heard of it. ,2010000
LUCIEN It's completely brilliant and impossible. ,112000
He says life is round: we're stuck on this wheel. ,2180000
Living. ,22200000
And dying. ,3820000
Allen opens the book, looks through the old pages, sees a strange symbol: a diagram of a celestial WHEEL. LUCIEN An endless circle. ,12700
Until. ,17600000
Someone breaks it. ,21400
You came in here, you rupture the pattern. ,170000
Bang: the whole world... ,57700000
ALLEN LUCIEN Gets wider. ,16800
Gets wider. ,66600
Lucien looks at Allen, amazed. ,6240000
LUCIEN How did you...? ,3130000
ALLEN Consonance. ,8
Reiteration of themes. ,35500
Lucien, intrigued, circles in close. ,12200
LUCIEN Are you a writer? ,1680000
Because I've got a job for a writer. ,3760000
Allen, mesmerized. ,36
ALLEN No. I'm not. 14. ,87700000
LUCIEN Well, you're not anything yet. ,2
This boy so close, the rush of contact. ,666000
From down the hall... ,793000
HALL MONITOR (O.S.) Ginsberg?! Allen doesn't even register his name. ,79500
Lucien smirks. ,55
LUCIEN Isn't that you? ,134000
HALL MONITOR (O.S.) Ginsberg?! Allen groans, snaps out of it. ,68
ALLEN What?! HALL MONITOR (O.S.) Phone call! Allen reluctantly hands Lucien back the BOOK. ALLEN I'll be back. ,575
INT. DORM HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS The Hall Monitor hands Allen the phone. ,193000
ALLEN Hello? ,8770
NAOMI (O.S.) I found the wires. ,2950000
INT. HALLWAY, GINSBERG HOME - NIGHT Naomi grips the phone desperately. ,13300
We see she has stripped the wallpaper from the wall and pulled the telephone wire out from underneath. ,336000
NAOMI He's trying to get inside my head. ,1800000
ALLEN (O.S.) Dad is not trying to get inside your head, okay? ,3900000
Put him on. 15. ,14800000
NAOMI He's not home. ,4020000
He left. ,14900000
INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT Allen, confused. ,45300
Up the hallway, a door locks. ,1690000
ALLEN Where'd he go? ,6230000
INT. GINSBERG HOME - NIGHT Naomi looks out the window, does not want to answer. ,112000
NAOMI Honey, I need you come home now. ,15000000
ALLEN (O.S.) Mom I can't come home. ,1870000
Listen, you have to look after yourself. ,110000000
NAOMI I don't feel good. ,4020000

LUCIEN You can't show this to anyone. ,148000000
We PULL BACK to reveal the author of the manuscript: a eighteen-year-old ALLEN GINSBERG. Unslept and exhausted. ,9510
But determined. ,182000
Allen stares defiantly at Lucien from the other side of the bars. ,11700
ALLEN Then tell the truth, Lu. LUCIEN You weren't even there. ,106000
It's your truth. ,7790000
It's fiction. ,555000
Allen grabs for his manuscript back, but Lucien pulls it out of reach. ,676000
LUCIEN You wanted him gone too. ,3
You sent him to me. ,520000
Allen reaches through the bars and SNATCHES the paper. ,281000
Lucien won't let go -- it's a tug of war between the two boys, two wills. ,42500
Allen yanks the paper from Lucien's grip and wins. ,8320
Lucien, panicking. ,5
LUCIEN (CONT'D) Please. ,8430
You'll kill me with that. ,296000

A stain of blood on David's chest shrinks, vanishes. ,99100
David's eyes OPEN. CUT TO: INT. THE TOMBS - DAY LUCIEN ...or they destroy you. ,197000
From behind the bars of a jail cell, Lucien Carr (the young man from the opening) finishes reading from a paper MANUSCRIPT in his hand. 2. ,27100
Lucien, furious, crumples it up. ,100000
LUCIEN You can't show this to anyone. ,148000000
We PULL BACK to reveal the author of the manuscript: a eighteen-year-old ALLEN GINSBERG. Unslept and exhausted. ,9510
But determined. ,182000
Allen stares defiantly at Lucien from the other side of the bars. ,11700
ALLEN Then tell the truth, Lu. LUCIEN You weren't even there. ,106000
It's your truth. ,7790000
It's fiction. ,555000
Allen grabs for his manuscript back, but Lucien pulls it out of reach. ,676000
LUCIEN You wanted him gone too. ,3
You sent him to me. ,520000
Allen reaches through the bars and SNATCHES the paper. ,844000
Lucien won't let go -- it's a tug of war between the two boys, two wills. ,42500
Allen yanks the paper from Lucien's grip and wins. ,8320
Lucien, panicking. ,5
LUCIEN (CONT'D) Please. ,8430
You'll kill me with that. ,296000
Allen turns and races towards the exit of the prison. ,204000
Desperate, Lucien calls out after him. ,14100
LUCIEN Allen! No! Allen doesn't turn. ,2080000
An alarm HAMMERS through the prison. ,143000
LUCIEN Allen! No! DON'T...! CUT TO BLACK. INSERT TITLE: KILL YOUR DARLINGS CUT TO: 3. ,40000
EXT. GINSBERG HOME - NIGHT SUPER: PATERSON, NEW JERSEY. 1943. ,31700
ONE YEAR EARLIER. Over a strip of working-class row homes, we hear the sounds of a radio announcer giving a dispatch from the war front. ,1070
RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.) American daylight bombers were busy again, as our liberators with fighter escort continue the air offensive with another sock at German coastal installations in France. ,5890
INT. GINSBERG HOME - NIGHT The radio continues playing to a modest home. ,1420000
We see a young man cleaning house, sweeping in the background. ,33500000
RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.) But the Germans report a big new red army push toward Romania. ,6960
This is World War news. ,128000
As the war report ends, a stuffy musical piece begins. ,835000
We hear a groan from the young man. ,213000
From out of the background emerges Allen Ginsberg (now 17, fresh-faced, horn-rimmed glasses, dutiful son). ,5220
The kind of kid who takes care of everything. ,6660000
He storms up to the radio, switches the station to a fast- paced boogie-woogie number. ,11300
He smiles and dances joyfully to the up-beat number with his broom. ,39300
The door slams. ,12000000
Allen looks up, caught in the act, to see his father LOUIS (40's, school teacher, Jewish working-class poet) home from work. ,35
Allen accidentally drops the broom. ,10100
LOUIS How was she today? ,6220000
Louis turns off the music. ,114000
The playful mood dies. ,94000
Allen spots the mail in his father's hand. ,143000
ALLEN Fine. ,57200
Anything for me? ,31000000
LOUIS Why? ,23200
You expecting something? ,7860000
Allen looks down, a bad liar. 4. ,47000000
ALLEN No. Suddenly, from upstairs, the sound of glass shattering. ,29500
Then a woman whimpering in pain. ,783000
Allen, worried, looks off, dread in his face. ,303000
His father just sighs. ,946000
LOUIS I told you it wouldn't work. ,1330000
Allen rushes upstairs. ,279000
INT. MASTER BEDROOM, GINSBERG HOME - NIGHT Allen runs into a dark room, flips on the light. ,81
ALLEN Mom? ,5310
His mother NAOMI (early 40's, Jewish, deep personality disorder) squats in the corner of the room, in a dirty bathrobe. ,1560
Her knuckles are bleeding. ,785000
NAOMI You've got to get me out of here. ,20700000
He nailed the windows shut while I was in the bath. ,549000
She motions to the shattered window pane across the room. ,34700
Allen sees her blood on the sill, where she tried to escape. ,62200
He moves towards her, to console her. ,107000
What he's good at. ,1580000
ALLEN Dad didn't do that. ,10800000
I nailed the windows. ,998000
Because you're not right. ,40800000
Naomi, in the midst of a paranoid attack, puts her finger to her mouth. ,55700
NAOMI Shhh...Allen. ,35200
He can hear you! Allen wraps his mother's hand with a dish towel. ,22500
Clear your head. ,7280000
Do you want to go back to Greystone? ,155000000
NAOMI He wouldn't dare put me back there. 5. ,4890000
ALLEN Then listen to me. ,29600
NAOMI SHHHH. He can hear you! She's losing it. ,117000
Allen quickly thinks, turns to her bureau. ,964000
He pulls out a RECORD, starts the phonograph and turns up the volume. ,24900
ALLEN Can he still hear me? ,65800000
A BRAHMS WALTZ plays. ,271000
NAOMI What did you say? ,900000
Allen turns the music up all the way. ,1360000
Allen mimes deafness. ,2930000
Finally, she understands: their sounds are drowned out by the music. ,40100
Allen reaches for her. ,3150000
She finally softens, takes his hand. ,3880000
As mother and son waltz together with the music, Naomi clutches Allen to her, like he's the only thing keeping her sane. ,5750
Because he is. ,4640000
NAOMI Don't ever leave me. ,1110000
Allen, trapped, over her shoulder. ,64800
From the doorway, we see that Louis has been watching the whole time. ,2780000
EXT. GINSBERG FRONT PORCH - NIGHT Overwhelmed, Allen shakes on the front stairs. ,3490
She's not well. ,6680000
The faint sound of jazz, fun from someone else's home from down the block. ,237000
Louis comes out onto the porch, with an open LETTER in hand from the mail pile. ,143000
He's upset. ,7030000
LOUIS Were you even going to tell me you applied?! Allen spies the "Columbia University" seal on the front. ,52500
He's been caught. ,621000
He looks down, ashamed. 6. ,696000
ALLEN I didn't want her to know. (beat) It was a dream anyway. ,4970000
Louis lights his own cigarette. ,15300000
Offers his son one. ,176000
He declines. ,444000
LOUIS (talking to himself, dreaming) Trilling's there. ,1580000
Van Doren. ,475000
English Professors. ,181000
Important fellows. ,1310
And New York City, right in your goddamn lap. ,518000
Louis sits beside his son. ,250000
LOUIS Love that is hoarded, molds at last. ,9310
Allen, surprised to hear his Dad reciting one of his poems. ,139000
LOUIS Until we know, the only thing we have-- ALLEN is what we give away. ,969000
LOUIS Is what we hand away. ,7950000
Have, hand. ,13600000
Consonance. ,796000
ALLEN Give, is. ,227000
Assonance. ,965000
LOUIS I wrote the goddamn poem. ,42500
Go write your own. ,305000
Louis hands over the letter. ,346000
The hardest thing he's ever done. ,695000
Allen takes the envelope, rips it open. ,13000
He's looking at the response in shock. ,1530000
Louis tries to read his son's face. ,6230000
ALLEN I got in. ,6040000
LOUIS You got in?! 7. ,49700000
ALLEN I got into Columbia University! LOUIS You got into Columbia University?! Allen and his father embrace. ,14900000
CUT TO: EXT. COLUMBIA QUAD - DAY First day of college. ,380000
Allen crosses the grand Ivy League campus in awe. ,66600
Before him, the staggering facade of the library like the Parthenon. ,357000
A troop of Navy midshipmen pass by. ,3900
Wartime is on. ,35
INT. ALLEN'S DORM ROOM - DAY Allen sets his bag on his bed. ,190000
He notices on one wall are patriotic posters, exercise posters. ,611000
He's already got a roommate. ,348000
He eyes a map of the New York City subway system. ,32100000
He can't believe he's really here in the big city. ,2110000
He walks over to it. ,151000
Allen studies the map, his finger gliding down to Greenwich Village. ,42800
LUKE (O.S.) You don't wanna go down there. ,1010000
His roommate LUKE, 18, buzz cut, in a sweaty Columbia sweatshirt, leans over him. ,13600
LUKE Land of the fairies. ,840000
Head there and you never come back. (extending a firm hand) Luke Detweiler, Danville, Virginia. ,22600
ALLEN Allen Ginsberg. ,540000
LUKE (bright smile) You're Jewish, right? ,374000
Allen nods. ,1090
Luke smacks him on the shoulder. 8. ,3620000
LUKE I'm getting good at telling. ,7610000
INT. LIBRARY, MAIN HALL - DAY The beautiful main hall of Columbia University's Butler Library. ,187000
It's Ivy League tradition meets thousands of years of scholarship. ,45700
A pompous TOUR GUIDE shows off museum-like glass vitrines to new and prospective students with their families. ,1600
TOUR GUIDE The South Hall library is a church, and these are the sacraments. ,280000
Allen stumbles along on the tour. ,28900
The tour guide points to the contents of the vitrines: the wonders of literary history. ,15900
TOUR GUIDE Original folios of the most important texts in history. ,195000
Beowolf. ,10900000
First folio Hamlet. ,224000
The Gutenberg Bible. ,6820000
Allen looks down, amazed. ,1180000
That's Shakespeare's handwriting. ,301000
TOUR These are among the University's most prized possessions. ,2270000
Suddenly, in a reflection in the glass, a flash of RED catches Allen's eye. ,15300
LUCIEN (O.S.) Let's hear a bit, shall we? ,308000
Allen turns to see Lucien Carr (now 19, devilish, stunningly handsome) LEAP onto a library desk with a book in hand. ,4
He wears a distinctive red CRAVAT that only the truly beautiful can pull off. ,401000
The entire room hushes. ,107000
LUCIEN (reciting) On a Sunday afternoon, when the shutters are down and the proletariat possesses the street... ,12100
The tour guide looks around confused. 9. ,1100000
LUCIEN ...there are certain thoroughfares which remind one of nothing less... ,183000
Lucien gets on his knees and THRUSTS a lamp between his legs. ,18500
LUCIEN ...than a big cancerous cock. ,23500
Parents look around in shock. ,66600
A female student is instantly aroused. ,32600
The prim PERMISSIONS LIBRARIAN clomps over. ,10300
PERMISSIONS LIBRARIAN What is this nonsense? ,3100000
LUCIEN Henry Miller. ,71800
PERMISSIONS LIBRARIAN Get down immediately. ,18200000
That book is restricted. ,18700000
LUCIEN Which is why I committed it to memory. ,30200
PERMISSIONS LIBRARIAN Security! As two Campus Security Guards rush in, Lucien leaps down in front of Allen. ,40700
LUCIEN Alert the press! Tell them Lucien Carr is innocent! Lucien flees, rushes out of the library. ,4690
TOUR GUIDE That was highly unusual. ,238000
Campus is actually quite quiet. ,414000
Moving on. ,11500000
But Allen doesn't hear, he grins to himself. ,1780000
Who the hell was that? ,64900
PROFESSOR STEEVES (V.O.) The Victorian sonnet has the balance of three tenets. ,28700
INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY Patrician, old-guard PROFESSOR STEEVES lectures on the first day of class, Allen dutifully taking notes in his journal. 10. ,57
PROFESSOR STEEVES Rhyme, meter, conceit. ,1630
Without this balance, a poem becomes slack, sloppy. ,400000
An untucked shirt. ,125000
Allen disagrees and raises his hand. ,12900
ALLEN Professor Steeves, then how do you explain Whitman? ,769000
No one interrupts Professor Steeves. ,45200
Murmurs from around the class. ,97700
Steeves locks down his gaze on Allen. ,238000
PROFESSOR STEEVES Say more. ,65500
Two more sentences. ,48300000
ALLEN He hated rhyme and meter. ,135000
The whole point was untucking your shirt. ,125000
Professor Steeves smiles to himself. ,18600
There's one of them every year. ,4180000
PROFESSOR STEEVES What's your name? ,181000000
ALLEN Allen Ginsberg. ,540000
PROFESSOR STEEVES Ginsberg? ,12100
Your father perhaps is the poet Louis Ginsberg? ,571000
Allen nods. ,1090
PROFESSOR STEEVES He writes rhyming, metered verse. ,18100
Why do you think he chose that form? ,10400000
All eyes on Allen. ,6350000
ALLEN Because it's easier. ,141000
The class titters. ,22300000
Professor Steeves hushes them. ,7
PROFESSOR STEEVES This university exists because of tradition and form. ,196000
Would you rather this building be built by engineers or Whitman and his boys at play? 11. ,115000
Allen, realizing he is trapped, unable to answer. ,6580000
Professor Steeves smiles victoriously and writes on the blackboard. ,16500
PROFESSOR STEEVES There can be no creation before imitation. ,1910000
The other students take note. ,50700000
Allen sighs, follows suit. ,28500
From the back row, Lucien watches Allen and unsheathes a grin. ,40400
INT. ALLEN'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT Luke, dressed in a suit, puts on cologne. ,12500
He looks back at Allen who is copying from a tome of sonnets. ,93400
LUKE Shut the books. ,1440000
We're taking my brother with us to the social. ,14800000
He ships out tomorrow. ,82800
ALLEN I can't. ,300000
You see how much I've got to do. ,3900000
LUKE He's Navy. ,2070000
It's catnip for the skirts. ,55000
Luke pulls out his own waistband and sprays some cologne down the front. ,4570000
Allen shakes his head. ,529000
Luke shrugs. ,2460
LUKE You hymies are really all about work, huh? ,34500000
Luke slams the door behind. ,103000
Allen, alone stares out the window. ,137000
A record starts up down the hall. ,8810000
Clarinet, strings. ,30500
Allen's ears prick up. ,107000
He knows this tune. ,213000
It's the same BRAHMS from his mother's bedroom. ,1870000
INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT Allen walks down a darkened hallway, the music leading him forward. ,36800
He reaches a door with a lit transom. ,171000
He knocks. ,194000
The unlocked door creaks open. 12. ,1130000
INT. LUCIEN CARR'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT A mattress lies on the floor, a phonograph on top. ,62600
Candles light the room. ,33700000
Books for furniture. ,10900000
And Lucien on the floor, reading the Times and smoking. ,913000
ALLEN Brahms? ,2100
Allen walks inside. ,1580000
Lucien looks up, surprised. ,8010000
LUCIEN Finally. ,1310
An oasis in this wasteland. ,182000
Nervous, Allen tries to make conversation. ,153000
ALLEN How come you're not at the social? ,6230000
LUCIEN Only the most anti-social have to go to an event actually called one. ,1680000
Libation? ,629000
Lucien rises and grabs a wine bottle corked with a sock. ,10800
Allen looks nervously towards the door. ,19200
ALLEN You drink in your room?! LUCIEN How does a horrible bottle of Chianti sound? ,14900
Lucien inverts two small glasses and pours. ,581000
Allen stares. ,75300
He doesn't break the rules. ,192000
ALLEN I don't drink. ,1710000
LUCIEN Freshman? ,13
ALLEN Yes. ,19700
Lucien hands him his glass. ,92500
LUCIEN Excellent. ,611
I love first times. ,12000000
I want my whole life to be composed of them. ,4890000
Life is only interesting if life is wide. 13. ,46300000
Lucien toasts Allen's glass. ,39200
LUCIEN To Walt Whitman, you dirty bastard. ,248000
Allen, mortified, not sure how to take that reference as Lucien knocks his wine back in one gulp. ,6680
LUCIEN How's your Yeats? ,1130000
Have you read A Vision? ,12200000
He tosses Allen a BOOK. Dog-eared, underlined and crumbling. ,5310
ALLEN Never heard of it. ,2010000
LUCIEN It's completely brilliant and impossible. ,112000
He says life is round: we're stuck on this wheel. ,2180000
Living. ,22200000
And dying. ,3820000
Allen opens the book, looks through the old pages, sees a strange symbol: a diagram of a celestial WHEEL. LUCIEN An endless circle. ,12700
Until. ,17600000
Someone breaks it. ,21400
You came in here, you rupture the pattern. ,170000
Bang: the whole world... ,57700000
ALLEN LUCIEN Gets wider. ,16800
Gets wider. ,66700
Lucien looks at Allen, amazed. ,6240000
LUCIEN How did you...? ,3130000
ALLEN Consonance. ,8
Reiteration of themes. ,35500
Lucien, intrigued, circles in close. ,12200
LUCIEN Are you a writer? ,1680000
Because I've got a job for a writer. ,3760000
Allen, mesmerized. ,192
ALLEN No. I'm not. 14. ,87700000
LUCIEN Well, you're not anything yet. ,2
This boy so close, the rush of contact. ,666000
From down the hall... ,793000
HALL MONITOR (O.S.) Ginsberg?! Allen doesn't even register his name. ,79500
Lucien smirks. ,55
LUCIEN Isn't that you? ,134000
HALL MONITOR (O.S.) Ginsberg?! Allen groans, snaps out of it. ,68
ALLEN What?! HALL MONITOR (O.S.) Phone call! Allen reluctantly hands Lucien back the BOOK. ALLEN I'll be back. ,575
INT. DORM HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS The Hall Monitor hands Allen the phone. ,193000
ALLEN Hello? ,8790
NAOMI (O.S.) I found the wires. ,2950000
INT. HALLWAY, GINSBERG HOME - NIGHT Naomi grips the phone desperately. ,13300
We see she has stripped the wallpaper from the wall and pulled the telephone wire out from underneath. ,336000
NAOMI He's trying to get inside my head. ,1800000
ALLEN (O.S.) Dad is not trying to get inside your head, okay? ,3900000
Put him on. 15. ,14800000
NAOMI He's not home. ,4020000
He left. ,14900000
INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT Allen, confused. ,45300
Up the hallway, a door locks. ,1690000
ALLEN Where'd he go? ,6240000
INT. GINSBERG HOME - NIGHT Naomi looks out the window, does not want to answer. ,112000
NAOMI Honey, I need you come home now. ,15000000
ALLEN (O.S.) Mom I can't come home. ,1870000
Listen, you have to look after yourself. ,110000000
NAOMI I don't feel good. ,4020000
INT. DORM HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS Lucien passes Allen, putting on his coat, heading out to the city. ,18600
ALLEN (whispered, to Lucien) You're going to the dance? ,216000
LUCIEN No. Downtown. ,6620000
NAOMI (O.S.) Who are you talking to? ,4010000
Is he there with you?! ALLEN No, he's not here with me. ,41700000
Lucien quickly waves goodbye to Allen, heads down the staircase. ,187000
Allen, torn between his mother and this boy. ,446000
ALLEN (into the phone) Listen, I'll come as soon as I can. 16. ,22700000
INT. GINSBERG HOME - NIGHT Naomi, clutches the phone, deadly serious. ,3300
NAOMI You need to promise. ,42800
INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT Lucien slides down the stairway rail. ,3650
Allen watching him disappear. ,734000
ALLEN Yes. ,19700
Ipromiseloveyoubye. ,11
Allen hangs up on his mother and races after Lucien. ,22500
INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT Allen, breathless, storms down a flight of stairs, catches up to Lucien. ,3390
Lucien turns, loving this. ,13700
The puppy following his new master. ,18700000
LUCIEN Coming? ,586
EXT. COLUMBIA ENTRANCE - NIGHT Lucien throws his jacket over Allen's shoulder and leads him into the wild city around the corner. ,25400
LUCIEN Welcome to the edge of the world. ,2720000
The sound of the IRT screeching takes us to the SUBWAY MAP from Allen's dorm room which comes to life. ,10800
A RED LINE glides down the map from Columbia University all the way...to Greenwich Village. ,133000
CUT TO: INT. STAIRS/APARTMENT, 48 MORTON STREET - NIGHT Allen, anxious, follows Lucien up a crowded staircase to a West Village apartment. ,35
The sounds of a party spill out onto the landing and beyond. ,206000
It's pure bohemia here. 17. ,42000
Smoke, artists flirting, arguing. ,203000
Allen sees... ,7680
A black man making out with a white woman. ,4
An older, elegant woman sharing a cigarette with a boy half her age. ,5
She stares seductively at Allen. ,161000
Lucien enjoying himself immensely. ,77900
This is what a first time looks like. ,46300000
LUCIEN Allen in Wonderland. ,828000
Lucien grabs a DRUNK YOUNG GIRL from the crowd, kisses her passionately. ,91600
Then lets her go, keeps walking. ,69500
ALLEN Do you know her?! LUCIEN No, and I don't plan on it. ,3600000
She tasted like imported sophistication and domestic cigarettes. ,71600
INT. BATHROOM, 48 MORTON APARTMENT - NIGHT A makeshift bar in a sink full of ice. ,42800
Lucien scavenges through empty bottles in the sink, looking for any remaining alcohol. ,10900
LUCIEN (calling out) Dave! Where's the liquor?! I'll be right back. ,131000
As Lucien walks off, Allen tries to make himself inconspicuous and sits down on the tub. ,7170
BILL (O.S.) Hrffrff hrffrfffrfrfrrf. ,7
Allen looks down to see WILLIAM BURROUGHS (aka BILL, 29, tall, gaunt, wry), in a suit, sprawled out in the bathtub: a gas mask over his mouth. ,848
Bill motions to the side of the tub. ,124000
BILL (through the mask) You're...pinching... ,15400
Allen stands up, realizing his foot is on a snaking black tube leading to a metal canister of gas. ,13900
ALLEN Sorry. ,8890
Are you all right? 18. ,98800000
BILL (long exhale) Artifacts in the visual field, some light-headedness. ,1530
Motor hyperactivity. ,7450
ALLEN What is that? ,9650000
BILL Nitrous oxide, for narcoanalysis. ,682
Know thyself. ,295000
And beshit thyself. ,29
Ever done that? ,221000
Allen shakes his head no. ,229000
Bill turns off the gas. ,49300
Offers a joint to Allen. ,145000
ALLEN Oh no, thanks. ,1990000
I don't do...the cannabis. ,98400000
Bill eyes Allen, skeptically. ,18200
BILL Show me the man both sober and happy, and I'll show you the crinkled anus of a lying asshole. ,7110
Allen raises an eyebrow. ,23400
Lucien returns with a paper in hand. ,61900
LUCIEN Allen, Willy. ,362000
Willy, Allen, Lucien reefer. ,16
Lucien takes the joint. ,4350000
Bill puts the tube of gas back in his mouth, back to business. ,639000
Lucien grabs Allen's hand, pulls him to the party. ,3130000
ALLEN (whispered) Is he a criminal? ,125000
LUCIEN He wishes he were a criminal. ,910000
The Burroughs family is richer than God. ,15000
ALLEN He looks like a criminal. 19. ,1630000
LUCIEN He's a Harvard man, and he's going to be an amazing artist. ,1100000
His current medium is himself. ,6500000
Allen spots the TERM PAPER in Lucien's hand. ,111000
ALLEN What's that? ,5650000
LUCIEN Bunk for school. ,41700
Now, come on, I want you to meet our host. ,532000
INT. LIVING ROOM, 48 MORTON APARTMENT - NIGHT DAVID KAMMERER, the man we saw dead at the film's opening, runs his fingers on the rim of a wine glass. ,65200
He's sharp, the mayor of this scene. ,309000
An eerie hum from the glass. ,684000
DAVID What there is, darlings and demoiselles, is a circle. ,10000
Life is round. ,9490000
Patterns, routines, a wheel of self-abuse. ,45400
Margaret, don't even deny it. ,942000
Allen turns to Lucien. ,31600
ALLEN (whispered) Sounds like you. ,427000
LUCIEN Because it was me. ,40500000
First. ,30200000
David sees the boys talking. ,1150000
He eyes Allen, curiously. ,314000
DAVID Until. ,19100
The the disruption we long for, comes along and the circle is broken. ,86700
LUCIEN (whispered, to Allen) He said he was my guardian angel, but that I was too much work. ,4140
David crosses through crowd towards Allen. ,1700000
DAVID Take this unbloomed stalwart. 20. ,55
Uh-oh. ,4680000
Allen's singled out. ,71500
David pulls him to the center of the room. ,25600000
DAVID And you are? ,20
ALLEN Allen. ,337000
Bill walks in, knows what game his friend is playing. ,1990000
BILL Play nice, David. ,74800000
DAVID Allen, who comes uninvited to my apartment. ,57900
LUCIEN Actually I invited him. ,17900
DAVID None of us notice him. ,1390000
Look at him. ,1750000
Why would we bother? ,80400
In his tucked shirt and creased pants, Allen realizes the entire party is scrutinizing, judging him. ,5700
DAVID So the pattern of our evening, our lives, holds. ,682000
But under the right circumstances, even he might change the world. ,7860000
Jazz music sparks, PRE-LAP from where this party's going next. ,1450000
Lucien eyes Allen -- an idea forming. ,2710000
CUT TO: INT. TAVERN - NIGHT The party continuing at this underground speakeasy. ,56600
Straight, gay, young, old, a subterranean zoo. ,3
A jazz signer owns the room. ,55200
Bill, David, and Allen at a table. ,360000
David's moment alone with Allen. ,2750000
DAVID So you just met Lucien in the lunch line and now he's all that you can see. 21. ,208000
ALLEN Why don't you like me? ,75400000
BILL Because David was in the same godforsaken line. ,6010
David and Bill share a knowing look. ,1260000
Lucien returns to the table and slams a glass down. ,35000
LUCIEN Some earjob at the bar just called me "boy." So I stole his drink. ,93900
Allen scans, sees the famous poet OGDEN NASH looking around for his glass. ,10100
ALLEN That's Ogden Nash! LUCIEN Who's Ogden Nash? ,244000
ALLEN The best selling poet in the country. ,376000
BILL "A girl who is bespectacled. ,6890000
She may not get her nectacled. ,30000000
But safety pins and bassinets--" DAVID "Await the girl who fassinets." LUCIEN And that's what he's selling?! I'll kill him. ,276
Bill takes out a switchblade. ,113000
BILL Aim for the throat. ,234000
A realization. ,290000
Lucien leans in, focuses his charm. ,12300
LUCIEN No. We're not going to kill him. ,4690000
Even better. ,10600000
We're going make sure nobody remembers him. (turns to Allen) How many men started the Renaissance? 22. ,58900
ALLEN Two. ,41300
LUCIEN And the Romantics. ,3130000
DAVID More than I suspect this theory accommodates. ,86400
ALLEN (Five?) Lucien's passion building. ,290000
LUCIEN We're sending millions to fight the Fascists in Europe, but they're here! Meter and rhyme--- ALLEN And Professor Steeves--- LUCIEN Yes! They're all guards in some prison. ,1410
Let's make the prisoners come out and play. ,5690000
Let's come up with new words, new rhythms. ,2400000
Allen, swept up in the energy. ,1170000
He couldn't be more captivated. ,244000
LUCIEN We need a name. ,72100000
ALLEN How did they come up "Dada"? ,28000000
BILL Tristan Tzara jabbed a knife into a dictionary. ,10900
LUCIEN Shit. ,33
So that's been done. ,2
DAVID A literary revolution without writing a word. ,4060000
Neat trick, Lu. BILL Well, I'm listening. 23. ,34100
ALLEN What about Yeats? ,2800000
How about the "New Vision?" LUCIEN Ginsy, you're hired! Allen smiles a mile wide. ,193000
He's in. ,13500000
Suddenly, the jazz singer stops. ,256000
The band puts down their instruments. ,1740000
POLICEMEN escort a businessman and another gentleman out of the bathroom, in HANDCUFFS. The mood in the bar chills. ,12000
BAR-GOER (O.S.) Fucking perverts. ,4
Allen, terrified, looks at David, who looks back, knowing exactly now who Allen is. ,4380000
A DOOR CRASH leads us to... ,5
EXT. BAR - DAWN Drunk, Allen and Lucien stumble to the ground. ,26200
LUCIEN "In the dawn, armed with a burning patience, we shall enter the splendid city!" Allen sits up. ,65
ALLEN Shit. ,1970
LUCIEN It's Rimbaud. ,3
It's overwritten, I know. ,6360000
He's allowed. ,210000
ALLEN No, my mother. ,34200000
This is bad. ,13000000
This is very bad. ,1890000
LUCIEN What is? ,1540
Allen stands, gathers himself urgently. ,12800
He needs to be somewhere about twelve hours ago. ,80700
ALLEN She's going to be furious. 24. ,1980000
LUCIEN Don't go then. ,530000
ALLEN You don't understand. ,1580000
I have to. ,6430000
LUCIEN What? ,2750
ALLEN It's complicated. ,5820000
Lucien sees his friend scared. ,25300
Moved, he links his arm with Allen's. ,1310000
LUCIEN Perfect. ,1070
I love complicated. ,9680000
INT. GINSBERG HOME - DAY Allen and Lucien enter the house to find Louis standing nervously with a suitcase beside a DOCTOR. DOCTOR Greystone will alert you if there's a change in her condition. ,2680
A DOCTOR holds out a clipboard. ,43100
Louis sheepishly signs the document on top. ,6780
ALLEN Dad, what's going on? ,136000000
LOUIS Your mother needs her rest. ,3090000
A male nurse leads Naomi from the bedroom. ,177000
She is still in her robe, shattered and fogged by sedatives. ,12800
Allen realizes what's happening. ,58500000
ALLEN (to his father) You can't do this to her. ,6350000
Naomi recognizes her son. ,18800
NAOMI Where were you? ,138000000
ALLEN I was out. ,5670000
With a friend. 25. ,10800000
NAOMI I called you! MALE NURSE It's time to go, Mrs. ,2990000
Ginsberg. ,1720000
The nurse takes Naomi to the door. ,378000
Allen pulls her back, into the house. ,1500000
ALLEN No, you're not leaving. ,6240000
Naomi points an accusing finger at Louis. ,187000
NAOMI He already signed the papers. ,453000
ALLEN Dad?! LOUIS It's for the best. ,102000
ALLEN Your best. ,932000000
LOUIS It's for her best. ,889000
It's not for my best. ,374000000
Look at her! Listen to her! Naomi babbling. ,1260000
Allen realizing how far she's gone. ,93300
Allen shoves the nurse off Naomi. ,13600
ALLEN Get off! From deep within, Allen can see she is still there, and we can see she knows that it's too late. ,183000
NAOMI This is your fault. ,1640000
The nurse escorts a docile Naomi out of the room. ,5
Allen breaks down. ,6410
Lucien, mute witness to it all. ,935000
MUSIC PLAYS over... ,25000000
INT. GINSBERG HALLWAY - NIGHT Louis lectures Allen. ,39000
We close in on Allen's despondent face. ,824000
The dutiful son's first failure. 26. ,2110000
EXT. GINSBERG FRONT PORCH - NIGHT Allen escapes outside where Lucien is sitting, smoking. ,2540
Allen sits beside him, notices: Lucien has been crying. ,4
ALLEN Complicated enough? ,3080000
LUCIEN At least you have her. ,404000
My father left me when I was four. ,861000
A beat of understanding between them. ,3230000
Lucien lays down. ,6460000
Allen takes his cigarette, lays next to him. ,107000
ALLEN I've been thinking about what Yeats said. ,1560000
To be reborn, we have to die first. ,23300000
Allen hands him back the smoke. ,3190000
Lucien perks up. ,97300
LUCIEN So what do you suggest? ,3
INT. LUCIEN CARR'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT Candlelight flickers on Allen's face. ,157000
ALLEN I've spent my life making other people happy. ,1310000
We PULL BACK to see a noose around Allen's neck. ,165000
A suicide is underway. ,8810000
ALLEN It's time I find happiness the only way I see possible. ,837000
LUCIEN (O.S.) Oh please. ,257000
Die already. ,85500
We PULL BACK again to see Lucien beside, also with a noose around his neck. ,9550
Both of them on chairs. ,5360000
Their nooses are attached to the same pipe. ,12200
LUCIEN Where's the verve? ,2740000
The brio?! From atop the chair, Lucien kicks his record player with his foot. ,287000
Grand classical music screeches to a start. 27. ,2410000
LUCIEN If it be that I am indulging my self-consciousness in justifying myself, or if it be-- ALLEN That's a run-on. ,6680
LUCIEN Don't edit me! Lucien shoves Allen. ,228000
Allen trips off the chair, the noose snaps tight...and suddenly he's hanging in mid-air. ,76000
He struggles. ,370000
Lucien tries to help, but falls off his own chair. ,2900000
The pipe starts to bend. ,300000
Allen and Lucien panic as they swing through the room, suspended in air. ,479
The pipe BREAKS. They crash to the ground. ,108000
A beat of relief -- are we alive? -- and the two break out into hysterics. ,2630000
DIRTY BE-BOP JAZZ PLAYS OVER... ,132000
A RED LINE TRAVELS UP THE SUBWAY MAP FROM COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY TO HARLEM BRINGING US TO... ,329000
INT. HARLEM NIGHTCLUB (MINTON'S PLAYHOUSE) - NIGHT The black crowd claps for the same jazz singer and band we saw earlier, now on their home turf. ,4360
Allen, Lucien and Bill watch from a table. ,33900
ALLEN (O.S.) The New Vision declares-- LUCIEN (O.S.) "Proclaims" is better-- INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT (48 MORTON) - DAY Lucien and Allen pace while Bill reclines on the sofa. ,8
They riff on the The New Vision manifesto. ,236000
ALLEN Proclaims the death of morality. ,12400
And... 28. ,2850000
LUCIEN The expression of self. ,6580000
ALLEN The true, uninhibited, uncensored expression of the self. ,12400
BILL Words, boys. ,2860000
Empty words. ,272000
LUCIEN Then what do you suggest? ,3130000
BILL The derangement of the senses. ,26800
CUT TO: INT. JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT Allen bopping his head to the new rhythms in this club - the place where be-bop jazz is being born. ,1850
CUT TO: INT. 48 MORTON APARTMENT - DAY Bill cracking open a Benzedrine canister and removing the soaking strip from inside. ,1010
We realize it is a BODY. ALLEN (V.O.) Some things, once you've loved them, become yours forever. ,244000
The body BREAKS the surface and we see the face of its owner ---- DAVID KAMMERER, 33, bearded, handsome. ,18600
He is clothed, open white shirt, khakis. ,235000
Dead. ,18700000
ALLEN (V.O.) And if you try to let them go... ,1110000
Suddenly, a breath: he comes back to life. ,1770000
David floats back to LUCIEN CARR, 20, (blonde, beautiful, shirtless and terrified), waist deep in the water. ,4490
The scene is playing in REVERSE MOTION. ALLEN (V.O.) They only circle back and return to you. ,257000
David's body LIFTS into the young man's arms. ,653000
We see David's feet and hands are TIED together with shoelaces. ,131000
Stones rise back into his pockets. ,4230000
ALLEN (V.O.) They become part of who you are... ,293000
A stain of blood on David's chest shrinks, vanishes. ,99100
David's eyes OPEN. CUT TO: INT. THE TOMBS - DAY LUCIEN ...or they destroy you. ,197000
From behind the bars of a jail cell, Lucien Carr (the young man from the opening) finishes reading from a paper MANUSCRIPT in his hand. 2. ,27100
Lucien, furious, crumples it up. ,100000
LUCIEN You can't show this to anyone. ,148000000
We PULL BACK to reveal the author of the manuscript: a eighteen-year-old ALLEN GINSBERG. Unslept and exhausted. ,9510
But determined. ,182000
Allen stares defiantly at Lucien from the other side of the bars. ,11700
ALLEN Then tell the truth, Lu. LUCIEN You weren't even there. ,106000
It's your truth. ,7790000
It's fiction. ,555000
Allen grabs for his manuscript back, but Lucien pulls it out of reach. ,676000
LUCIEN You wanted him gone too. ,3
You sent him to me. ,520000
Allen reaches through the bars and SNATCHES the paper. ,281000
Lucien won't let go -- it's a tug of war between the two boys, two wills. ,42500
Allen yanks the paper from Lucien's grip and wins. ,8320
Lucien, panicking. ,5
LUCIEN (CONT'D) Please. ,8430
You'll kill me with that. ,296000
Allen turns and races towards the exit of the prison. ,204000
Desperate, Lucien calls out after him. ,14100
LUCIEN Allen! No! Allen doesn't turn. ,2080000
An alarm HAMMERS through the prison. ,143000
LUCIEN Allen! No! DON'T...! CUT TO BLACK. INSERT TITLE: KILL YOUR DARLINGS CUT TO: 3. ,40000
EXT. GINSBERG HOME - NIGHT SUPER: PATERSON, NEW JERSEY. 1943. ,31700
ONE YEAR EARLIER. Over a strip of working-class row homes, we hear the sounds of a radio announcer giving a dispatch from the war front. ,1070
RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.) American daylight bombers were busy again, as our liberators with fighter escort continue the air offensive with another sock at German coastal installations in France. ,5890
INT. GINSBERG HOME - NIGHT The radio continues playing to a modest home. ,1420000
We see a young man cleaning house, sweeping in the background. ,33500000
RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.) But the Germans report a big new red army push toward Romania. ,6960
This is World War news. ,128000
As the war report ends, a stuffy musical piece begins. ,835000
We hear a groan from the young man. ,213000
From out of the background emerges Allen Ginsberg (now 17, fresh-faced, horn-rimmed glasses, dutiful son). ,5220
The kind of kid who takes care of everything. ,7310000
He storms up to the radio, switches the station to a fast- paced boogie-woogie number. ,11300
He smiles and dances joyfully to the up-beat number with his broom. ,39300
The door slams. ,12000000
Allen looks up, caught in the act, to see his father LOUIS (40's, school teacher, Jewish working-class poet) home from work. ,35
Allen accidentally drops the broom. ,10100
LOUIS How was she today? ,6220000
Louis turns off the music. ,114000
The playful mood dies. ,94000
Allen spots the mail in his father's hand. ,143000
ALLEN Fine. ,57200
Anything for me? ,31000000
LOUIS Why? ,23200
You expecting something? ,7860000
Allen looks down, a bad liar. 4. ,47000000
ALLEN No. Suddenly, from upstairs, the sound of glass shattering. ,29500
Then a woman whimpering in pain. ,783000
Allen, worried, looks off, dread in his face. ,303000
His father just sighs. ,946000
LOUIS I told you it wouldn't work. ,1330000
Allen rushes upstairs. ,279000
INT. MASTER BEDROOM, GINSBERG HOME - NIGHT Allen runs into a dark room, flips on the light. ,82
ALLEN Mom? ,5300
His mother NAOMI (early 40's, Jewish, deep personality disorder) squats in the corner of the room, in a dirty bathrobe. ,1560
Her knuckles are bleeding. ,785000
NAOMI You've got to get me out of here. ,20700000
He nailed the windows shut while I was in the bath. ,549000
She motions to the shattered window pane across the room. ,21800
Allen sees her blood on the sill, where she tried to escape. ,62200
He moves towards her, to console her. ,107000
What he's good at. ,1580000
ALLEN Dad didn't do that. ,10800000
I nailed the windows. ,998000
Because you're not right. ,40800000
Naomi, in the midst of a paranoid attack, puts her finger to her mouth. ,55700
NAOMI Shhh...Allen. ,35200
He can hear you! Allen wraps his mother's hand with a dish towel. ,22500
Clear your head. ,7280000
Do you want to go back to Greystone? ,155000000
NAOMI He wouldn't dare put me back there. 5. ,4890000
ALLEN Then listen to me. ,29600
NAOMI SHHHH. He can hear you! She's losing it. ,117000
Allen quickly thinks, turns to her bureau. ,964000
He pulls out a RECORD, starts the phonograph and turns up the volume. ,24900
ALLEN Can he still hear me? ,65800000
A BRAHMS WALTZ plays. ,271000
NAOMI What did you say? ,900000
Allen turns the music up all the way. ,1360000
Allen mimes deafness. ,2940000
Finally, she understands: their sounds are drowned out by the music. ,40100
Allen reaches for her. ,3150000
She finally softens, takes his hand. ,3880000
As mother and son waltz together with the music, Naomi clutches Allen to her, like he's the only thing keeping her sane. ,5750
Because he is. ,4640000
NAOMI Don't ever leave me. ,1110000
Allen, trapped, over her shoulder. ,64800
From the doorway, we see that Louis has been watching the whole time. ,2780000
EXT. GINSBERG FRONT PORCH - NIGHT Overwhelmed, Allen shakes on the front stairs. ,3490
She's not well. ,6680000
The faint sound of jazz, fun from someone else's home from down the block. ,237000
Louis comes out onto the porch, with an open LETTER in hand from the mail pile. ,143000
He's upset. ,7020000
LOUIS Were you even going to tell me you applied?! Allen spies the "Columbia University" seal on the front. ,52500
He's been caught. ,621000
He looks down, ashamed. 6. ,696000
ALLEN I didn't want her to know. (beat) It was a dream anyway. ,4970000
Louis lights his own cigarette. ,15300000
Offers his son one. ,176000
He declines. ,444000
LOUIS (talking to himself, dreaming) Trilling's there. ,1580000
Van Doren. ,475000
English Professors. ,181000
Important fellows. ,1310
And New York City, right in your goddamn lap. ,518000
Louis sits beside his son. ,250000
LOUIS Love that is hoarded, molds at last. ,9310
Allen, surprised to hear his Dad reciting one of his poems. ,139000
LOUIS Until we know, the only thing we have-- ALLEN is what we give away. ,969000
LOUIS Is what we hand away. ,7950000
Have, hand. ,13600000
Consonance. ,795000
ALLEN Give, is. ,227000
Assonance. ,966000
LOUIS I wrote the goddamn poem. ,42500
Go write your own. ,305000
Louis hands over the letter. ,346000
The hardest thing he's ever done. ,695000
Allen takes the envelope, rips it open. ,13000
He's looking at the response in shock. ,1530000
Louis tries to read his son's face. ,6230000
ALLEN I got in. ,6040000
LOUIS You got in?! 7. ,49700000
ALLEN I got into Columbia University! LOUIS You got into Columbia University?! Allen and his father embrace. ,14900000
CUT TO: EXT. COLUMBIA QUAD - DAY First day of college. ,380000
Allen crosses the grand Ivy League campus in awe. ,66600
Before him, the staggering facade of the library like the Parthenon. ,357000
A troop of Navy midshipmen pass by. ,3900
Wartime is on. ,29
INT. ALLEN'S DORM ROOM - DAY Allen sets his bag on his bed. ,190000
He notices on one wall are patriotic posters, exercise posters. ,611000
He's already got a roommate. ,348000
He eyes a map of the New York City subway system. ,32100000
He can't believe he's really here in the big city. ,2110000
He walks over to it. ,151000
Allen studies the map, his finger gliding down to Greenwich Village. ,42800
LUKE (O.S.) You don't wanna go down there. ,1010000
His roommate LUKE, 18, buzz cut, in a sweaty Columbia sweatshirt, leans over him. ,13600
LUKE Land of the fairies. ,840000
Head there and you never come back. (extending a firm hand) Luke Detweiler, Danville, Virginia. ,22600
ALLEN Allen Ginsberg. ,540000
LUKE (bright smile) You're Jewish, right? ,374000
Allen nods. ,1090
Luke smacks him on the shoulder. 8. ,3620000
LUKE I'm getting good at telling. ,7610000
INT. LIBRARY, MAIN HALL - DAY The beautiful main hall of Columbia University's Butler Library. ,187000
It's Ivy League tradition meets thousands of years of scholarship. ,45700
A pompous TOUR GUIDE shows off museum-like glass vitrines to new and prospective students with their families. ,1600
TOUR GUIDE The South Hall library is a church, and these are the sacraments. ,272000
Allen stumbles along on the tour. ,28900
The tour guide points to the contents of the vitrines: the wonders of literary history. ,15900
TOUR GUIDE Original folios of the most important texts in history. ,195000
Beowolf. ,10900000
First folio Hamlet. ,224000
The Gutenberg Bible. ,6820000
Allen looks down, amazed. ,1180000
That's Shakespeare's handwriting. ,301000
TOUR These are among the University's most prized possessions. ,2270000
Suddenly, in a reflection in the glass, a flash of RED catches Allen's eye. ,15300
LUCIEN (O.S.) Let's hear a bit, shall we? ,308000
Allen turns to see Lucien Carr (now 19, devilish, stunningly handsome) LEAP onto a library desk with a book in hand. ,4
He wears a distinctive red CRAVAT that only the truly beautiful can pull off. ,401000
The entire room hushes. ,107000
LUCIEN (reciting) On a Sunday afternoon, when the shutters are down and the proletariat possesses the street... ,12100
The tour guide looks around confused. 9. ,1100000
LUCIEN ...there are certain thoroughfares which remind one of nothing less... ,183000
Lucien gets on his knees and THRUSTS a lamp between his legs. ,18500
LUCIEN ...than a big cancerous cock. ,23500
Parents look around in shock. ,66600
A female student is instantly aroused. ,32600
The prim PERMISSIONS LIBRARIAN clomps over. ,10300
PERMISSIONS LIBRARIAN What is this nonsense? ,3100000
LUCIEN Henry Miller. ,71800
PERMISSIONS LIBRARIAN Get down immediately. ,18200000
That book is restricted. ,18700000
LUCIEN Which is why I committed it to memory. ,30200
PERMISSIONS LIBRARIAN Security! As two Campus Security Guards rush in, Lucien leaps down in front of Allen. ,40700
LUCIEN Alert the press! Tell them Lucien Carr is innocent! Lucien flees, rushes out of the library. ,4690
TOUR GUIDE That was highly unusual. ,238000
Campus is actually quite quiet. ,414000
Moving on. ,11500000
But Allen doesn't hear, he grins to himself. ,1780000
Who the hell was that? ,64900
PROFESSOR STEEVES (V.O.) The Victorian sonnet has the balance of three tenets. ,28700
INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY Patrician, old-guard PROFESSOR STEEVES lectures on the first day of class, Allen dutifully taking notes in his journal. 10. ,57
PROFESSOR STEEVES Rhyme, meter, conceit. ,1630
Without this balance, a poem becomes slack, sloppy. ,400000
An untucked shirt. ,125000
Allen disagrees and raises his hand. ,12900
ALLEN Professor Steeves, then how do you explain Whitman? ,769000
No one interrupts Professor Steeves. ,103000
Murmurs from around the class. ,97700
Steeves locks down his gaze on Allen. ,238000
PROFESSOR STEEVES Say more. ,65500
Two more sentences. ,48300000
ALLEN He hated rhyme and meter. ,135000
The whole point was untucking your shirt. ,125000
Professor Steeves smiles to himself. ,18600
There's one of them every year. ,4180000
PROFESSOR STEEVES What's your name? ,181000000
ALLEN Allen Ginsberg. ,540000
PROFESSOR STEEVES Ginsberg? ,12100
Your father perhaps is the poet Louis Ginsberg? ,571000
Allen nods. ,1090
PROFESSOR STEEVES He writes rhyming, metered verse. ,18100
Why do you think he chose that form? ,10400000
All eyes on Allen. ,6350000
ALLEN Because it's easier. ,141000
The class titters. ,22300000
Professor Steeves hushes them. ,7
PROFESSOR STEEVES This university exists because of tradition and form. ,196000
Would you rather this building be built by engineers or Whitman and his boys at play? 11. ,115000
Allen, realizing he is trapped, unable to answer. ,6580000
Professor Steeves smiles victoriously and writes on the blackboard. ,16500
PROFESSOR STEEVES There can be no creation before imitation. ,1910000
The other students take note. ,50700000
Allen sighs, follows suit. ,28500
From the back row, Lucien watches Allen and unsheathes a grin. ,40400
INT. ALLEN'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT Luke, dressed in a suit, puts on cologne. ,12500

We're taking my brother with us to the social. ,14800000
He ships out tomorrow. ,82800
ALLEN I can't. ,300000
You see how much I've got to do. ,3900000
LUKE He's Navy. ,2070000
It's catnip for the skirts. ,55000
Luke pulls out his own waistband and sprays some cologne down the front. ,4570000
Allen shakes his head. ,530000
Luke shrugs. ,2460
LUKE You hymies are really all about work, huh? ,34500000
Luke slams the door behind. ,103000
Allen, alone stares out the window. ,137000
A record starts up down the hall. ,8810000
Clarinet, strings. ,30300
Allen's ears prick up. ,107000
He knows this tune. ,213000
It's the same BRAHMS from his mother's bedroom. ,1870000
INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT Allen walks down a darkened hallway, the music leading him forward. ,36800
He reaches a door with a lit transom. ,171000

The unlocked door creaks open. 12. ,1130000
INT. LUCIEN CARR'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT A mattress lies on the floor, a phonograph on top. ,62600
Candles light the room. ,33700000
Books for furniture. ,10900000
And Lucien on the floor, reading the Times and smoking. ,913000
ALLEN Brahms? ,2100
Allen walks inside. ,1580000
Lucien looks up, surprised. ,8010000
LUCIEN Finally. ,1310
An oasis in this wasteland. ,182000
Nervous, Allen tries to make conversation. ,153000
ALLEN How come you're not at the social? ,6230000
LUCIEN Only the most anti-social have to go to an event actually called one. ,1680000
Libation? ,629000
Lucien rises and grabs a wine bottle corked with a sock. ,10800
Allen looks nervously towards the door. ,19200
ALLEN You drink in your room?! LUCIEN How does a horrible bottle of Chianti sound? ,14900
Lucien inverts two small glasses and pours. ,581000
Allen stares. ,75200
He doesn't break the rules. ,192000
ALLEN I don't drink. ,1710000
LUCIEN Freshman? ,13
ALLEN Yes. ,19700
Lucien hands him his glass. ,92500
LUCIEN Excellent. ,611
I love first times. ,12000000
I want my whole life to be composed of them. ,4890000
Life is only interesting if life is wide. 13. ,46300000
Lucien toasts Allen's glass. ,39200
LUCIEN To Walt Whitman, you dirty bastard. ,248000
Allen, mortified, not sure how to take that reference as Lucien knocks his wine back in one gulp. ,6680
LUCIEN How's your Yeats? ,1130000
Have you read A Vision? ,12200000
He tosses Allen a BOOK. Dog-eared, underlined and crumbling. ,5310
ALLEN Never heard of it. ,2010000
LUCIEN It's completely brilliant and impossible. ,112000
He says life is round: we're stuck on this wheel. ,2180000
Living. ,22200000
And dying. ,3820000
Allen opens the book, looks through the old pages, sees a strange symbol: a diagram of a celestial WHEEL. LUCIEN An endless circle. ,12700
Until. ,17600000
Someone breaks it. ,21400
You came in here, you rupture the pattern. ,170000
Bang: the whole world... ,57700000
ALLEN LUCIEN Gets wider. ,16800
Gets wider. ,66700
Lucien looks at Allen, amazed. ,6240000
LUCIEN How did you...? ,3130000
ALLEN Consonance. ,8
Reiteration of themes. ,35500
Lucien, intrigued, circles in close. ,12200
LUCIEN Are you a writer? ,1680000
Because I've got a job for a writer. ,3760000
Allen, mesmerized. ,36
ALLEN No. I'm not. 14. ,87700000
LUCIEN Well, you're not anything yet. ,2
This boy so close, the rush of contact. ,666000
From down the hall... ,793000
HALL MONITOR (O.S.) Ginsberg?! Allen doesn't even register his name. ,79500
Lucien smirks. ,55
LUCIEN Isn't that you? ,134000

NAOMI (O.S.) Who are you talking to? ,4010000
Is he there with you?! ALLEN No, he's not here with me. ,41700000
Lucien quickly waves goodbye to Allen, heads down the staircase. ,187000

EXT. COLUMBIA ENTRANCE - NIGHT Lucien throws his jacket over Allen's shoulder and leads him into the wild city around the corner. ,25400
LUCIEN Welcome to the edge of the world. ,2720000
The sound of the IRT screeching takes us to the SUBWAY MAP from Allen's dorm room which comes to life. ,10800

CUT TO: INT. STAIRS/APARTMENT, 48 MORTON STREET - NIGHT Allen, anxious, follows Lucien up a crowded staircase to a West Village apartment. ,35
The sounds of a party spill out onto the landing and beyond. ,206000
It's pure bohemia here. 17. ,42000
Smoke, artists flirting, arguing. ,203000
Allen sees... ,7670
A black man making out with a white woman. ,4
An older, elegant woman sharing a cigarette with a boy half her age. ,5
She stares seductively at Allen. ,161000
Lucien enjoying himself immensely. ,77900
This is what a first time looks like. ,46300000
LUCIEN Allen in Wonderland. ,828000
Lucien grabs a DRUNK YOUNG GIRL from the crowd, kisses her passionately. ,91600
Then lets her go, keeps walking. ,69500
ALLEN Do you know her?! LUCIEN No, and I don't plan on it. ,3600000
She tasted like imported sophistication and domestic cigarettes. ,71600
INT. BATHROOM, 48 MORTON APARTMENT - NIGHT A makeshift bar in a sink full of ice. ,42800
Lucien scavenges through empty bottles in the sink, looking for any remaining alcohol. ,10900
LUCIEN (calling out) Dave! Where's the liquor?! I'll be right back. ,131000
As Lucien walks off, Allen tries to make himself inconspicuous and sits down on the tub. ,7170
BILL (O.S.) Hrffrff hrffrfffrfrfrrf. ,7
Allen looks down to see WILLIAM BURROUGHS (aka BILL, 29, tall, gaunt, wry), in a suit, sprawled out in the bathtub: a gas mask over his mouth. ,848
Bill motions to the side of the tub. ,128000
BILL (through the mask) You're...pinching... ,15400
Allen stands up, realizing his foot is on a snaking black tube leading to a metal canister of gas. ,13900
ALLEN Sorry. ,8890
Are you all right? 18. ,98800000
BILL (long exhale) Artifacts in the visual field, some light-headedness. ,1530
Motor hyperactivity. ,7440
ALLEN What is that? ,9650000
BILL Nitrous oxide, for narcoanalysis. ,2380
Know thyself. ,295000
And beshit thyself. ,27
Ever done that? ,221000
Allen shakes his head no. ,229000
Bill turns off the gas. ,49300
Offers a joint to Allen. ,145000
ALLEN Oh no, thanks. ,1990000
I don't do...the cannabis. ,98400000
Bill eyes Allen, skeptically. ,18200
BILL Show me the man both sober and happy, and I'll show you the crinkled anus of a lying asshole. ,7120
Allen raises an eyebrow. ,23400
Lucien returns with a paper in hand. ,61900
LUCIEN Allen, Willy. ,362000
Willy, Allen, Lucien reefer. ,16
Lucien takes the joint. ,4350000
Bill puts the tube of gas back in his mouth, back to business. ,639000
Lucien grabs Allen's hand, pulls him to the party. ,3130000
ALLEN (whispered) Is he a criminal? ,125000
LUCIEN He wishes he were a criminal. ,910000
The Burroughs family is richer than God. ,15000
ALLEN He looks like a criminal. 19. ,1630000
LUCIEN He's a Harvard man, and he's going to be an amazing artist. ,1100000
His current medium is himself. ,6500000

INT. LIVING ROOM, 48 MORTON APARTMENT - NIGHT DAVID KAMMERER, the man we saw dead at the film's opening, runs his fingers on the rim of a wine glass. ,65200
He's sharp, the mayor of this scene. ,309000
An eerie hum from the glass. ,684000
DAVID What there is, darlings and demoiselles, is a circle. ,10000
Life is round. ,9490000
Patterns, routines, a wheel of self-abuse. ,45400
Margaret, don't even deny it. ,944000
Allen turns to Lucien. ,31600
ALLEN (whispered) Sounds like you. ,427000
LUCIEN Because it was me. ,40500000
First. ,30200000
David sees the boys talking. ,1150000
He eyes Allen, curiously. ,314000
DAVID Until. ,19100
The the disruption we long for, comes along and the circle is broken. ,86700
LUCIEN (whispered, to Allen) He said he was my guardian angel, but that I was too much work. ,4140
David crosses through crowd towards Allen. ,1700000
DAVID Take this unbloomed stalwart. 20. ,55
Uh-oh. ,4680000
Allen's singled out. ,71500
David pulls him to the center of the room. ,25600000

ALLEN Allen. ,337000
Bill walks in, knows what game his friend is playing. ,1990000
BILL Play nice, David. ,74800000
DAVID Allen, who comes uninvited to my apartment. ,57900
LUCIEN Actually I invited him. ,17900
DAVID None of us notice him. ,1390000
Look at him. ,1750000
Why would we bother? ,80400
In his tucked shirt and creased pants, Allen realizes the entire party is scrutinizing, judging him. ,5700
DAVID So the pattern of our evening, our lives, holds. ,682000
But under the right circumstances, even he might change the world. ,7860000

David's moment alone with Allen. ,2750000
DAVID So you just met Lucien in the lunch line and now he's all that you can see. 21. ,214000
ALLEN Why don't you like me? ,75400000
BILL Because David was in the same godforsaken line. ,6010
David and Bill share a knowing look. ,1260000
Lucien returns to the table and slams a glass down. ,35000
LUCIEN Some earjob at the bar just called me "boy." So I stole his drink. ,93900
Allen scans, sees the famous poet OGDEN NASH looking around for his glass. ,10100
ALLEN That's Ogden Nash! LUCIEN Who's Ogden Nash? ,244000
ALLEN The best selling poet in the country. ,376000
BILL "A girl who is bespectacled. ,6910000
She may not get her nectacled. ,30000000
But safety pins and bassinets--" DAVID "Await the girl who fassinets." LUCIEN And that's what he's selling?! I'll kill him. ,276
Bill takes out a switchblade. ,113000
BILL Aim for the throat. ,234000
A realization. ,291000
Lucien leans in, focuses his charm. ,12300
LUCIEN No. We're not going to kill him. ,4690000
Even better. ,10600000
We're going make sure nobody remembers him. (turns to Allen) How many men started the Renaissance? 22. ,58900

LUCIEN We're sending millions to fight the Fascists in Europe, but they're here! Meter and rhyme--- ALLEN And Professor Steeves--- LUCIEN Yes! They're all guards in some prison. ,1410
Let's make the prisoners come out and play. ,5690000
Let's come up with new words, new rhythms. ,2400000
Allen, swept up in the energy. ,1170000
He couldn't be more captivated. ,244000
LUCIEN We need a name. ,72100000
ALLEN How did they come up "Dada"? ,28000000
BILL Tristan Tzara jabbed a knife into a dictionary. ,10900
LUCIEN Shit. ,30
So that's been done. ,2
DAVID A literary revolution without writing a word. ,4060000
Neat trick, Lu. BILL Well, I'm listening. 23. ,34100
ALLEN What about Yeats? ,2800000
How about the "New Vision?" LUCIEN Ginsy, you're hired! Allen smiles a mile wide. ,194000
He's in. ,13500000
Suddenly, the jazz singer stops. ,256000
The band puts down their instruments. ,1740000
POLICEMEN escort a businessman and another gentleman out of the bathroom, in HANDCUFFS. The mood in the bar chills. ,12000

It's overwritten, I know. ,6360000
He's allowed. ,210000
ALLEN No, my mother. ,34200000
This is bad. ,13000000
This is very bad. ,1890000
LUCIEN What is? ,1540
Allen stands, gathers himself urgently. ,12800
He needs to be somewhere about twelve hours ago. ,80700
ALLEN She's going to be furious. 24. ,1980000
LUCIEN Don't go then. ,530000
ALLEN You don't understand. ,1580000
I have to. ,6430000
LUCIEN What? ,2670
ALLEN It's complicated. ,5820000
Lucien sees his friend scared. ,25300

LUCIEN Perfect. ,1080
I love complicated. ,9680000
INT. GINSBERG HOME - DAY Allen and Lucien enter the house to find Louis standing nervously with a suitcase beside a DOCTOR. DOCTOR Greystone will alert you if there's a change in her condition. ,2680

Louis sheepishly signs the document on top. ,6780
ALLEN Dad, what's going on? ,136000000
LOUIS Your mother needs her rest. ,3090000
A male nurse leads Naomi from the bedroom. ,177000
She is still in her robe, shattered and fogged by sedatives. ,12800

Look at her! Listen to her! Naomi babbling. ,20900000
Allen realizing how far she's gone. ,93300
Allen shoves the nurse off Naomi. ,13600

We PULL BACK again to see Lucien beside, also with a noose around his neck. ,9580
Both of them on chairs. ,5360000

The brio?! From atop the chair, Lucien kicks his record player with his foot. ,287000
Grand classical music screeches to a start. 27. ,2410000
LUCIEN If it be that I am indulging my self-consciousness in justifying myself, or if it be-- ALLEN That's a run-on. ,6680

INT. 48 MORTON APARTMENT - DAY Allen stopping Lucien in his tracks. ,48000
ALLEN Really? ,47800
LUCIEN It's how we make the world wider. ,88300000
Allen considers, agrees. ,8900000
ALLEN You are an extraordinary man. ,4040000
Lucien beams. ,14
LUCIEN Well, thank you. ,24600000
INT. 48 MORTON APARTMENT - AN HOUR LATER Bill at David's bookcase, removing classic art and literature books and throwing them to Allen. ,40000
BILL (O.S.) "Return of the Native." "Leviathan." Tear `em up boys. ,2160
Destroy the old and build the new! Allen, with scissors, cuts up pages of the books. ,383000
Hands them to Lucien who nails them to the wall. ,830000
It's a frantic assembly-line: Bill whips books to Allen, Allen tears out sections, and Lucien hammers them up. ,45400
We PULL BACK to see the entire wall is covered in words. ,15900000
INT. HARLEM NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT Time suddenly slows. ,41600
The music tapers, the hands of the drummer taper down to a still. ,40100
Allen looks around, scared and confused. ,134000
What is happening? ,5570000
A spotlight cuts through the room, capturing the singer's sweaty ecstasy, the bassist's fingers mid-plucking. ,17
The room freezes. ,1270000
Unlit cigarette dangling from his lip, Allen turns to Bill. 31. ,3870
Bill holds up his finger - it is on fire. ,7690000
He lights Allen's cigarette with the flame. ,147000
We have entered into another universe. ,55800
Lucien stands -- the only thing moving -- and Allen follows. ,447000
He steps into the frozen moment. ,104000
And it's beautiful. ,1160000
LUCIEN Watch this. ,10
Lucien leans over a young woman, a statue at a table with a young man in military attire. ,367000
LUCIEN (whispered in her ear) Go. The girl comes to life and clambers over the young man to a second, more attractive soldier. ,11000
And kisses him. ,154000
The pair erupt into life, into desire. ,70400
Lucien and Allen sit on the stage beneath the frozen musicians. ,164000
Lucien pulls out a BOY SCOUT KNIFE. Wraps Allen's hand in a fist around the blade. ,20400
He pulls the knife free. ,550000
Allen winces in pain. ,12300
Lucien does the same to his own palm, then presses their two bloody hands together. ,71200
A ceremony. ,1320000
Allen's eyes roll back. ,7090000
David appears in a janitor uniform. ,18700
The Technicolor fades. ,13700
DAVID What the hell is this? ,17200000
CUT TO: INT. 48 MORTON APARTMENT - NIGHT Allen, the nitrous oxide mask over his face inhaling from a tank of gas. ,1330
He has been adrift in a hallucination. ,965000
Lucien presses Allen's hand back and forth, both unharmed. ,21100
BILL Time slows down as you drift deeper and deeper into your cave... ,11700
Bill notices David, turns off the gas. 32. ,7070000
BILL We are exploring the avenues of Allen's mind. ,204000
David looks around the mess of his living room, his pillaged library of books, papers all over the floor. ,3910
DAVID Dimly-lit, I am sure. ,87400
What have you done to my apartment? ,191000
Allen struggles to his feet, moaning. ,3
Lucien steps between David and their wall of clippings. ,1950000
LUCIEN David, don't touch anything. ,434000
We have to write it all down. ,80700000
Bill stands up, woozy. ,787000
Calls out to David. ,72000000
BILL Get this man a pair of scissors! DAVID This is not your revolution, this is my life. ,4390000
BILL What kind of life is it? ,1370000
DAVID It's mine. ,7940000
Not everyone gets an allowance. (beat) Leave. ,118000
Get out! Allen stumbles out of the room, scared. ,49000000
David approaches Lucien. ,2910000
DAVID I need to speak to you. ,2520000
Alone. ,16800000
INT. BATHROOM, 48 MORTON APARTMENT - NIGHT Allen splashes water on his face. ,186000
In the mirror, he sees David and Lucien in the bedroom. ,14600
David hands Lucien a TERM PAPER. LUCIEN (O.S.) It only has to be five pages. 33. ,77600
He tilts the mirror to see them clearly. ,54700
A glimpse into their private dynamic. ,490000
INT. BEDROOM, 48 MORTON APARTMENT - NIGHT Lucien flips through the term paper. ,29200
LUCIEN You make me too smart, they're gonna suspect something's up. ,89400
David throws Lucien's coat over his shoulder. ,202000
DAVID And get you sent back to your mother again? ,5160000
That would just be the end of you. ,44800000
LUCIEN Fuck you. ,46300000
David spots Allen watching from the bathroom. ,139000
INT. BATHROOM - 48 MORTON APARTMENT - NIGHT Allen, caught, looks down, pretends he heard nothing. ,21600
But it's too late. ,35100000
David walks over and SLAMS the door in Allen's face. ,187000
PROFESSOR STEEVES (O.S.) Kill your darlings. ,45300
INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY Professor Steeves, intent, in front of the class. ,38800
PROFESSOR STEEVES Your crushes, your juvenile metaphysics. ,12200
None of them belong on the page. ,11300000
It is the first principle of good creative work. ,2160000
A work of fiction you will deliver as your final exam. ,52800000
He sees Allen, badly hungover and brooding, writing in a journal. ,23800
Ignoring class. ,7850
PROFESSOR STEEVES Oh look. ,51500
Whitman Jr. graced us with his presence today. 34. ,48400
Steeves walks to Allen's desk, grabs his journal. ,247000
PROFESSOR STEEVES "The New Vision. ,75900000
Extraordinary men propel us forward. ,276000
It is our duty to break the law." (to Allen) Fantastic. ,2430000
ALLEN There's more life in those five pages than in the dozens of bad sonnets we've read in class. ,623000
Steeves cocks his eye, stares down Allen. ,113000
The first time Allen has defied anyone. ,1010000
Ever. ,21000000
PROFESSOR STEEVES You want life? ,26500
You want the world on fire? ,77900000
Steeves motions to the door. ,696000
Then to Allen. ,259
PROFESSOR STEEVES The war awaits. ,1110000
What will it be? ,4800000
Steeves tosses the journal back down on Allen's desk. ,201000
Allen looks down at the "New Vision", ashamed. ,264000
INT. LUCIEN CARR'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT A rainstorm beating against the windows. ,30500
Allen paces as a drunk Lucien knocks off a bottle of wine and reads from Allen's journal. ,15700
LUCIEN "The rose that scents the summer air/ grows from my beloved's hair...?" ALLEN Keep going. ,30600
That's my sonnet for Steeves. ,2170000
Lucien flips through the journal, closes it, disappointed. ,28400
LUCIEN We have the map. ,55600000
We have the manifesto. ,3340000
We need the work. (suddenly cold) I was wrong. ,1580000
Maybe you're not up for this after all. 35. ,75000000
Allen stares at Lucien in disbelief. ,5460
Shocked, Allen rushes to Lucien's desk. ,1510
ALLEN Show me your fucking map. ,36700000
LUCIEN Stop! Allen grabs the pages Lucien has been working on: they are covered in doodles - there's nothing there. ,9110
ALLEN Oh right, you don't have anything because David's not here to write it for you! Lucien stands up, drunk. ,1060000
Furious. ,14300000
LUCIEN It's complicated. ,4
ALLEN I love complicated. ,1260000
Lucien steadies himself. ,26300
Furious. ,14300000
LUCIEN He's a professor working as a janitor so he can be near his precious Lu-Lu. He is a goddamn fruit who won't let me go. ,30400
ALLEN A fruit? ,9110000
LUCIEN A queer. ,6690000
This detonates inside Allen. ,7070000
Lucien crashes to his bed. ,48100
Allen sits beside. ,11500000
ALLEN Then let's get rid of him. ,4620000
Lucien softens, leans against Allen. ,110000
Passing out from the liquor. ,3970000
LUCIEN Right now, I just need you to write us something beautiful. (beat) First thought, best thought. 36. ,227000
Lucien drifts off. ,12500
Allen shakes, holding Lucien's body for the first time. ,48800
We follow Allen's P.O.V. as he runs his finger through Lucien's hair. ,202000
He can barely breathe, this close to what he finds beautiful. ,51600
Allen's fingers slide to Lucien's cheek. ,221000
Toward his lips. ,4670
Lucien's eyes open. ,72700
Allen tenses, afraid. ,179000
But Lucien suddenly takes Allen's finger in his mouth. ,71400
Sucks it, eyeing Allen the whole time. ,4830000
CUT TO: A thunder-clap. ,3340000
Lucien passed out in Allen's lap. ,205000
We were just in Allen's imagination. ,782000
INT. ALLEN'S DORM ROOM - DAY Allen at his typewriter. ,320000
A blank page. ,29300000
Inspired to write something beautiful. ,4980000
We see flashes of the past, snippets of Lucien: their contact, Lucien's smile. ,7920
Allen searching through their past. ,926000
All playing in reverse. ,11700000
LUCIEN Allen in Wonderland. ,828000
Is it something? ,1190000
He writes the words down. ,3210000
Flash of their past build in a crescendo as he keeps searching, digging through moments, leading to... ,662000
NOTHING. Allen's blocked. ,179000
He'll need more help if he's going to get to beautiful. ,2750000
BILL (O.S.) Pervitin. ,57100000
INT. BILL'S APARTMENT - DAY Bill with NORMAN (30s, shady, real criminal) and Allen in his dim, bookshelf-lined lair. ,14300
Bill gives the secret nod to Norman. 37. ,352000
BILL The Germans call it the "wonder drug." Prescribed for super-human feats. ,3080
Norman pops open a briefcase full of drugs. ,54000
Bill selects a green pill bottle and gives it to Allen. ,128000
INT. ALLEN'S DORM ROOM - DAY Allen pops two. ,353000
Waits for it. ,6110000
INT. ALLEN'S DORM ROOM - LATER The pace of everything has DOUBLED. Allen, sweating at his typewriter, jubilant, tapping his foot with the music, typing furiously at the keys. ,74
Whatever this drug is, it's working. ,44000
BILL (O.S.) But beware of the side-effects. ,903000
INT. BILL'S APARTMENT - DAY Bill rattles off the list. ,5500000
BILL Sudden blindness, bouts of diarrhea, heart palpitations, and a severe decline in moral standards. ,4100
CUT TO: INT. ALLEN'S DORM ROOM - DAY Allen jerking-off at his desk. ,229000
Allen racing around his room, burning off energy. ,220000
The memories are now flooding in. ,3420000
David at his party... ,8450000
DAVID (O.S.) Take this unbloomed stalwart. ,5
Lucien at the bar... 38. ,3130000
LUCIEN (O.S.) Let the prisoners come out and play. ,107000
INT. ALLEN'S DORM ROOM - EVENING Luke enters, turns on the light. ,11600
His jaw-drops: Allen is on his bed, running in place like a mad-man. ,490000
LUKE What the hell are you doing? ,6790000
Allen, furious at the interruption. ,77200
ALLEN Writing! INT. BILL'S APARTMENT - DAY Bill, a thoughtful eye on young Allen. ,255000
BILL But the words, oh the words... ,1050000
INT. ALLEN'S DORM ROOM - DAY Allen's got it. ,1580000
He rips the pages from the typewriter. ,16600
INT. LUCIEN CARR'S DORM ROOM - DAY Lucien's door slams open. ,85200
A sleepless Allen, hair on end, storms into the room, fresh pages in hand. ,52100
ALLEN Lu! It's very rough but... ,1620000
David sits at Lucien's desk, writing. ,276000
Allen stops short. ,1940000
David spies the pages in Allen's hand. ,293000
DAVID Ah. The "Vision" at last. ,3500000
Can I see? ,5390000
Allen hides them behind his back. ,2170000
ALLEN Where's Lu? 39. ,1360000
DAVID He's out. ,24200000
With a senior, some football player. ,4210000
A writer and handsome too. (beat) James? ,185000
Jack. ,18500000
There it is. ,10400000
Jack. ,18500000
ALLEN You're not allowed to be here. ,98300
DAVID That's odd since I'm the only thing keeping him here. ,703000
ALLEN Not anymore. ,9610000
A stand-off. ,362000
David collects his jacket, approaches. ,39400
DAVID Piece of advice. ,2660000
You don't know Lu. As soon you think you do, he'll find someone else. ,447000
David smirks, walks off leaving Allen alone with his pages. ,44600
DAVID Or maybe he already has. ,27200000
INT. LUCIEN CARR'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT 3:00 AM. Allen snoring. ,98100
Then the sound of the door creaking open. ,961000
Allen wakes up to see Lucien entering. ,25000
LUCIEN What are you, moving in? ,64100000
ALLEN Where have you been?! Lucien starts getting undressed. ,75100
LUCIEN I found a real writer. ,672000
Already a million words under his belt before Columbia. ,57500
ALLEN You mean Jack? ,422000
Lucien fumbles. 40. ,12200
ALLEN Why didn't you tell me? ,77600000
LUCIEN What am I supposed to do? ,2
Newsreels? ,330000
He spots the piece of paper in Allen's hand. ,323000
LUCIEN What's that? ,3130000
Defensive, Allen pockets his poem for Lucien. ,92300
ALLEN Nothing. ,5870
Lucien gets into bed. ,3130000
LUCIEN If you're going to stay, don't hog the blanket. ,26900
Lucien closes his eyes. ,1040000
Allen sits up, jealous, his mind spinning. ,135000
He stares at Lucien. ,23000
ALLEN Why is Jack a real writer? ,32900
LUCIEN Once you meet him, you'll see what I mean. ,1440000
JACK (O.S.) Hey Al! INT. 118TH STREET APARTMENT - NIGHT Handsome JACK KEROUAC (mid-20's, athletic, infamous jaw) palms a football, fakes a pass to Allen. ,24
Allen, on the couch with a stack of pages, shakes his head. ,59200
ALLEN No. Lucien drinks wine beside. ,667000
Jack ignores Allen, wings the pigskin right at him. ,703000
Allen ducks. ,7630
The ball SLAMS into a painting on the wall. ,67900
It crashes onto Allen's head. ,97200
EDIE (O.S.) Jack? ,6790000
What was that? 41. ,6
JACK (with a wink) The damn cat! The bell around the neck of Jack's cat KIT KAT jingles as it scurries away. ,1900
Jack darts over, hangs the painting upside down. ,80100
JACK (whispered to Allen) She painted it. ,127000
Say nothing. ,1990000
Jack notices a piece of mail addressed to him next to Allen. ,158000
It's an old vinyl RECORD sent by his friend Sammy. ,2610000
He shouts down the hall. ,112000
JACK Hey when'd this come? ,14500000
EDIE (O.S.) Today. ,1010000
Where is Sammy now? ,12900000
JACK I dunno. ,12800000
Some battleship. ,2590
Lucien nods to the huge manuscript on Allen's lap. ,5600
We realize it is Jack's novel The Sea Is My Brother. ,4840000
LUCIEN What do you think? ,17000000
Brilliant, no? ,94700
ALLEN It's missing some periods and commas. ,25800
LUCIEN It's better than anything you've ever written. ,3870000
ALLEN I use periods and commas. ,1160000
JACK Both of you! Quiet! Jack sets up an old phonograph. ,4600000
The scratchy record starts as Jack sidles up close to the speaker. ,30700
VOICE OF SAMMY (O.S.) Jack, how are you chum? ,54500
JACK Sammy, you bastard. 42. ,87000
LUCIEN Who's Sammy? ,4120000
JACK My best friend since I was twelve. ,48200000
Off in the Navy. ,15100000
VOICE OF SAMMY (O.S.) We've just been through 20 days of German shelling, every three hours, night and day. ,42
This will be my last one for a while. ,9
We're headed out to the front. ,2320000
Some beach near Rome. ,77700000
Anzio? ,2000000
EDIE (O.S.) Come to the table! VOICE OF SAMMY (O.S.) It's supposed to be beautiful... ,25
Jack pulls the stylus off. ,65400
EDIE PARKER, Jack's wealthy, vivacious art student girlfriend (early 20's) walks in. ,2560
Messy, comfortable, adorable. ,1080000
She holds a pot, eyes Lucien and Allen. ,362000
EDIE I didn't know we were having guests. ,3680000
Jack comes to the table. ,562000
She smacks something down on a plate: it's brown GLOP. JACK What's this? ,2450000
EDIE I was aiming for stew. ,3310000
JACK You missed. ,64000000
Jack grabs his jacket. ,153000
EDIE Where are you going? ,28900
JACK Out. ,130000
EDIE Out? ,7900
I cooked all day for you. 43. ,5800000
JACK What do you want me to do? ,132000000
Eat shoe leather? ,5820000
I'm hungry and what you do in the kitchen is unholy. ,2330000
EDIE That's funny. ,292000
You talk like a Catholic. ,5350000
But you fuck me and won't marry me. ,1450000
How does that work? ,2780000
Allen and Lucien watch entranced. ,149000
JACK Shut your mouth, Edie. ,99100
EDIE I thought you liked it WIDE OPEN... ,216000
Jack exits, slams the door shut. ,80600
Edie stares at Allen and Lucien on the couch. ,12800
EDIE Scram. ,8
EXT. RIVERSIDE PARK - NIGHT Lucien drinks from a wine bottle as the three boys stroll. ,61200
Allen trails behind. ,3040000
JACK So Al. You thought my novel was shit? ,2290000
ALLEN Not exactly. ,11700000
It's... ,25000000
LUCIEN It's all true. ,2520000
Jack served in the Merchant Marines. ,134000
JACK I've left school twice already. ,50100
Columbia's full of squares. ,4090000
I'm not even sure why I bothered to come back. ,29700000
ALLEN (sarcastic) Then why don't you just ship out again? 44. ,406000
JACK Trust me. ,24200000
Sometimes when I fight with Edie, I want to. ,117000
Lucien stops. ,81
He spots a DINGY, floating off a dock. ,78900
He gets an idea. ,382000
LUCIEN You two did just fight. ,254000
JACK Carr, you're goddamn crazy. ,226000
Lucien RUNS for it, then Jack. ,14500000
Allen, now the third wheel, reluctantly chases after. ,607000
EXT. HUDSON RIVER - NIGHT The dingy drifts into view in the middle of the busiest river in the world - quiet at this late in the night. ,8850
Jack rowing. ,2770
JACK A "new vision?" ALLEN Yeah. ,1340000
JACK Sounds phony. ,441000
Movements are cooked up by people who can't write about the people who can. ,4480000
LUCIEN Lu, I don't think he gets what we're trying to do. ,830000
JACK Listen to me, this whole town's full of finks on the 30th floor, writing pure chintz. ,10800
Writers, real writers, gotta be in the beds. ,25400
In the trenches. ,4330000
In all the broken places. ,1590000
What're your trenches, Al? ALLEN Allen. ,133000
JACK Right. ,51100
Allen looks to Lucien for help. 45. ,166000
LUCIEN First thought, best thought. ,572000
ALLEN Fuck you. ,46300000
What does that even mean?! JACK Good. ,18300000
That's one. ,31800000
What else? ,13000000
ALLEN Fuck your one million words. ,74800
JACK Even better. ,12000000
ALLEN You don't know me. ,1760000
JACK You're right. ,20800
Who is you? ,3020000
Lucien loves this, raises an eyebrow. ,9560
Allen pulls out his poem from his pocket. ,59200
ALLEN Be careful. ,9350000
You are not in wonderland I have heard the strange madness long growing in your soul. ,1260000
But you are fortunate. ,109000
Lucien listens anew, realizing this poem is about him. ,17100
ALLEN In your ignorance In your isolation, you who have suffered Find where love hides. ,9510
Give. ,19900000
Share. ,40100000
Lose. ,16600000
Lest we die unbloomed. ,221000
Just the sound of the water. ,78200000
Completely vulnerable, Allen sits back down. ,18500
JACK Allen. ,226000
Beautiful, kid. ,45100
Allen looks up, moved. ,46900
ALLEN You asked me to. ,6520000
Remember? ,21100000
Lucien lights up. ,6400000
