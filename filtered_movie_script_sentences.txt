LA LA LAND Written by Damien Chazelle FADE IN... 
A sun-blasted sky. 
We HEAR radios -- one piece of music after another... 
We're -- 1 EXT. 101 FREEWAY - DAY Cars are at a standstill. 
It's a horrific traffic jam. 
Morning rush hour. 
Sun beating down, asphalt shimmering in the heat. 
The blown-out downtown L.A. skyline hovers in the distance. 
We DRIFT past more CARS. Hear one snippet of audio after another... 
One driver taps his steering wheel to PROG ROCK. Another sings to OPERA. A third raps along to a HIP-HOP track. 
We move from a RADIO INTERVIEW to a FRENCH BALLAD to TECHNO, until finally we begin to hear... ...a new, original piece of music... [ANOTHER DAY OF SUN] We settle on the CAR from which this new tune is playing. 
The driver is a YOUNG WOMAN. She hums along to the riff on her radio -- then starts SINGING. Then -- she EXITS her car. 
Then -- she starts MOVING down the lane. 
One by one, more DRIVERS join her -- SINGING and DANCING along. 
Without a single cut, we've found ourselves in a FULL- FLEDGED MUSICAL NUMBER... 
Drivers leap on car-tops, dance Jerome Robbins-style, making use of the road and the hot gleam of the automobiles. 
Arms swaying, feet banging, dancers darting, as the MUSIC blasts. 
We WEAVE and SWIRL and DART between and around the cars, taking the magic in... 
Finally -- all the drivers swing back into their vehicles -- and the song comes to a dramatic stop. 
Flash title card: WINTER A1 We settle on a new car. 
A 1983 Dodge Riviera. 
In it is SEBASTIAN, 32, L.A. native. 
He's listening to the radio. 
He's playing a track on his music system -- a tape of Thelonious Monk's "Japanese Folk Song". 
But he keeps stopping it, over and over and over -- always rewinding to the same exact spot. 
Revision 2. 
B1 OMIT C1 We DRIFT from his car to one further up ahead. 
A light-green 2005 Prius. 
Inside is MIA, 27, Nevada-raised. 
Six years of "no" in L.A. have toughened her, but she's still a dreamer. 
She seems to be on the phone, speaking into her car's system. 
Fast, fiery, full of energy -- MIA ...and I swear to God, she was wrecked. 
It was pure insanity. 
Mia stops. 
Thinks. 
Mutters to herself: "Insanity"... 
Then leans down and grabs a piece of paper from the passenger seat. 
It's a SCRIPT. MIA (CONT'D) (reading now) Pure lunacy. 
Oh God, I know... 
Just then -- the traffic around Mia starts to let up. 
She's too focused on her lines to notice. 
Then -- a long, sustained honk behind her: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHT. Mia comes to. 
Jerked back to reality. 
The honking car behind her swerves into the next lane. 
It's Sebastian. 
Mia gives him the finger. 
We then FOLLOW her as she drives... 2 OMIT 3 OMIT 4 INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY Mia works, photos of Hollywood icons on the wall behind her, as -- CUSTOMER #1 This doesn't taste like almond milk. 
MIA Don't worry, it is. 
I know sometimes it -- CUSTOMER #1 Can I see the carton? 
Mia hands it over. 
The Customer looks. 
CUSTOMER #1 (CONT'D) I'll have a black coffee. 
Mia gets the coffee. 
Quickly sneaks a look at a script hidden underneath her counter. 
The same one we saw in her car... 
Revision 3. 
She hands the coffee to the Customer. 
We follow the Customer out through the door -- as a WOMAN walks into the shop. 
We don't see the Woman's face, but we see all the eyes in the shop turn immediately to her. 
We see one CUSTOMER whisper to another, discreetly pointing as the WOMAN passes by... 
WOMAN Cappuccino, please. 
Mia nods. 
Gets it made. 
The Manager takes it from her. 
MANAGER On us. 
WOMAN No, I insist. 
She pays. 
Then smiles at Mia and drops a bill in the tip jar. 
Mia watches as the Woman walks off, is joined by a STUDIO EMPLOYEE on a golf cart outside -- we realize this coffee shop is on a STUDIO LOT -- and is driven away... 
Then -- Mia's phone rings. 
It reads: "MOM". Mia presses "IGNORE" and the time pops up on the phone's screen: 4:07. 
MIA Shit. 
Removing her apron and hurrying out, turning back as -- MANAGER Where do you think you're going? 
MIA It's -- five past... 
MANAGER You'd better be here early tomorrow. 
MIA Ok. -- then realizes she doesn't have her script, runs back to grab it, hurries on and then -- CRASHES into a table. 
Coffee and food spill all over her shirt, and all at once we're -- 5 INT. AUDITION ROOM - DAY Mia's in a thick winter coat, covering her stained shirt. 
On her cell, loudly laughing while her adrenaline surges -- MIA (CONT'D) And I swear to God, she was wrecked. 
It was pure lunacy. 
Oh God, I know... 
Revision 4. 
Her nerves are practically visible. 
As she talks, we PULL BACK -- to see that she's auditioning for a CASTING DIRECTOR. MIA (CONT'D) No, no, Turner's fine. 
So you -- are you waiting `til Denver to tell her...? (as her smile contracts) Oh. I see... (silence; she clenches her jaw...) No, you're right. 
I understand. (...and a tear falls from her eye) Ok... 
I just... 
Oh... 
An ASSISTANT appears through the glass on the door behind Mia, waving to the Casting Director: Yoohoo. 
Can I come in? 
MIA (CONT'D) (crying now) No, I'm happy for you... 
I -- I just -- CASTING DIRECTOR One second. 
Mia stops. 
The Casting Director waves the Assistant in. 
The Assistant scurries in, shows her boss a post-it. 
Mia stands there, trying to hold onto the tears, hold onto the emotion, as the Casting Director reads the post-it and thinks. 
CASTING DIRECTOR (CONT'D) ...I'll call her back. 
Tell her I'm almost done in here. 
The Assistant nods. 
Walks out. 
Mia waits, trying to maintain... 
CASTING DIRECTOR (CONT'D) You know what? 
I think we're good. 
Thanks for coming in. 
Mia looks at her. 
A beat. 6 INT. LOBBY - DAY Mia exits. 
Nerves still on edge. 
Passes one beautiful redhead after the next -- all getting ready to cry. 
Enters the elevator with two other WOMEN -- tall, statuesque. 
Also redheads. 7 INT. MIA'S APARTMENT - EARLY EVENING Mia enters. 
Exhausted. 
Heads to her ROOM. Revision 5. 
Old movie posters hang on the walls, including a big Ingrid Bergman one over the bed. 
There's also a shelf filled with acting books -- Uta Hagen, Stella Adler. 
Various other trinkets: an old globe, an old blue-and-red suitcase. 
Mia takes off her shoe. 
A blister on her sole. 8 WE CUT TO: Mia in the BATHROOM. Just showered, wrapped in a towel. 
She hums to herself. 
The mirror is fogged up. 
She turns off the vent. 
The mist on the glass thickens. 
She dabs some of it away. 
Dims the lights. 
Looks... 
With the fog in place, her reflection looks like one of those soft-focus old Hollywood close-ups. 
She hums as she brushes her hair... 
Then -- the door SWINGS open -- and the spell is broken. 
TRACY Holy Mother of God. 
Mia snaps out of it. 
Turns. 
Fog is enveloping TRACY, 27. 
TRACY (CONT'D) Ever heard of a vent? 
MIA I wanted to give you an entrance. 
ALEXIS (appearing in the hall, 26, eating Cheetos) Mia! How'd it go? 
MIA Eh... 
ALEXIS Same here. 
Was Jen there? 
Or Rachel? 
MIA I don't know who Jen and Rachel are. 
ALEXIS They're the worst. 
MIA I don't know if they were there. 
As Mia slips away -- ALEXIS I bet they were. 
Revision 6. 
CAITLIN (appearing, 27) Why is there a convention in the bathroom? 
TRACY Two minutes, people! Mia you're coming, right? 
WE PAN TO find Mia poking her head out of her bedroom -- MIA Can't. 
Working. 
TRACY (O.S.) What? (we PAN BACK to Tracy) Did she say "working"? 
A8 We follow Mia INSIDE her room. 
She closes the door. 
Takes a moment. 
You can tell in her eyes -- work or not, a night on the town is the last thing she wants to do now. 
B8 WE CUT to the HALLWAY, to find Tracy POUNDING on Mia's door. 
MIA (opening up) Yes? 
TRACY Look, I know things didn't go well today. 
There are four things in my inbox that you're perfect for and I will submit you. 
But right now -- you're coming. 
C8 With that -- she barges in and beelines to Mia's closet -- TRACY (CONT'D) It'll be fun. 
MIA It'll be a bunch of social climbers packed into one of those glass houses. 
TRACY Exactly. 
Fun. 
She pulls out a blue dress. 
As Alexis hurries in -- TRACY (CONT'D) MIA This looks familiar. 
I was going to give it back! Alexis moves from Mia's perfume to the dress, lighting up as she grabs it -- Revision 7. 
ALEXIS Come on, Mia. 
When else do you get to see every Hollywood cliché crammed into a single home? 
TRACY (faux-offended) Lex! I'm disappointed in you. 
There's nothing to make fun of. 
This party will be humanity at its finest. 
Mia rolls her eyes -- and, with that -- Tracy BREAKS INTO SONG. [SOMEONE IN THE CROWD] She play-acts the clichés this party will represent. 
Alexis and Caitlin join in, giddy and playful. 
Mia can't help but laugh. 
The roommates sing and dance, hoping to persuade Mia to join the night's revelry... 
Mia remains reluctant. 
Stays behind in her room as her roommates head out the door. 
But she's starting to wonder: A night at home, feeling sorry for herself -- or a night out with her friends...? 9 EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING / STREET - NIGHT We're outside now, and BACK with Tracy, Alexis and Caitlin, marching across the courtyard and toward the street. 
They sing, dance, half-assuming Mia is a no-go -- -- until Mia APPEARS, blue-dress-clad. 
Her roommates look at her in surprise -- then delight. 
The energy swells and the four characters dance their way together down the street. 
They dive into a single CAR, and WE DISSOLVE TO... 10 OMIT. A10 OMIT. 11 EXT. CITY - NIGHT An old-fashioned MONTAGE of a night on the town: neon signs and overflowing champagne glasses. 
Soon enough, we're at... 12 EXT. MODERN HILLTOP HOUSE - NIGHT Valet cars lined up. 
We FOLLOW Alexis, Tracy, Caitlin and Mia to the door... 13 INT./EXT. HILLTOP HOUSE - NIGHT ...and into a big-glass hilltop pad. 
We FOLLOW Mia as she takes in her surroundings. 
Revision 8. 
A D.J. turning tables. 
A FAT OLD PRODUCER dancing with a TWENTY-SOMETHING. A trio of AGENTS glad-handing each other in rhythm by the bar. 
Yep -- every cliché is here... 
Mia tries talking to a pair of WOMEN -- who promptly ditch her. 
Seeing she's now alone, a YOUNG MAN swoops in to hit on her. 
She makes a hasty exit toward the bar -- but the line's obscenely long. 
She nears the BATHROOM door -- but a COUPLE stands in her way, making out. 
She slips in behind them... 
A13 Inside the BATHROOM, Mia takes a moment. 
The joy of seconds ago is gone from her eyes now. 
She gazes into the mirror -- -- and SINGS by herself. 
This verse, sung in private, belongs to a new style: less brash, and far more vulnerable... 
Once finished, Mia takes a breath, steels herself to once again face the world, opens the door -- and rejoins the crowd... 
B13 We MOVE with her slowly now -- surrounded by the party, but everything set at a snail's pace, the crazed carousers moving in SLOW MOTION. It's the sadness underneath the revelry, the pain underneath the clichés... 
Gradually we RAMP UP. Follow Mia OUTSIDE, where we see the splash of blue-green that is the POOL -- and a flurry of FAKE SNOW falling from above... 
As we reach FULL-SPEED, a PARTY-GOER races to the edge, jumps -- -- and we PLUNGE WITH HIM INTO THE POOL. This is the climax of the number. 
Everyone joins in, circling the pool -- a swath of color against the black sky. 
Everyone dances, everyone sings -- and the song concludes with a blast of fireworks. 
C13 OMIT A14 EXT. STREET - NIGHT Close on a sign: "NO PARKING ANYTIME: TOW-AWAY ZONE". Revision 9. 
MIA (O.S.) No... 
We see Mia -- all alone, staring at the sign. 
No car in sight. 
She reaches into her purse, pulls out her cell phone to call Tracy. 
It's dead. 
MIA (CONT'D) No... 15 OMIT 16 OMIT 17 OMIT A17 OMIT B17 OMIT 18 OMIT 19 EXT. HILL / LOS ANGELES STREETS - NIGHT Mia trudges down the steep hill in her unwieldy heels. 
She's an hour-and-a-half walk from her place. 
She crosses roads and lots, navigates stretches where the sidewalk stops and gives way to shrubbery. 
A19 And then -- she hears something... 
Music. 
A piano, in the distance. 
And a MELODY -- one we will come to know very well... 
Without being sure why, she FOLLOWS THE SOUND. Passes several doors. 
Then stops. 
Has found where it's coming from... 
She reaches out -- and slowly opens a door... 
AND WE CUT RIGHT BACK TO: 20 EXT. 101 FREEWAY - EARLIER THAT MORNING AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHT. The same 101 traffic jam we began with. 
This time we're on Sebastian -- the honker. 
He passes Mia's car. 
She gives him the finger. 
He drives on, shaking his head... 21 OMIT 22 EXT. RAYO'S - MOMENTS LATER Sebastian sips a coffee as he gazes across the street -- at a 30's Deco building. 
A sign above the door: "VAN BEEK". A newer sub-heading below: "TAPAS & TUNES". Revision 10. 
The door opens. 
Two EMPLOYEES step out, setting up a valet stand. 
Sebastian watches them -- and shakes his head. 
The employees notice him. 
Recognize him. 
What is it with that guy...? 23A OMIT 23 INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - DAY Sebastian enters his apartment -- cramped, dingy, bare walls, no furniture or decoration, boxes filled with dusty black-and-white photographs and unused instruments on the floor, a black Steinway upright piano in the center of the living room -- and sees a WOMAN rummaging around. 
SEBASTIAN You gotta stop breaking into my home. 
She looks up. 
She's 37 quickly going on 50, and dressed like she doesn't care. 
This is LAURA, Sebastian's older sister. 
LAURA You think Mom or Dad would call this a home? 
Seeing that she's seated on a stained, decrepit stool -- SEBASTIAN Please don't sit on that. 
LAURA Are you serious? 
SEBASTIAN Yes. 
Hoagy Carmichael sat on that stool. 
The Baked Potato was gonna throw it away. 
LAURA I wonder why. (then, rising,) I brought you this. 
It's a throw rug. 
SEBASTIAN Don't need it. 
LAURA Yeah? 
What if I told you Miles Davis pissed on it? 
SEBASTIAN That's almost insulting... (then,) Did he? 
Revision 11. 
She shakes her head: Unbelievable. 
Tosses the rug to the side. 
LAURA When are you going to unpack these boxes? 
SEBASTIAN When I unpack them in my club. 
LAURA Oh my God. 
It's like a girl broke up with you and you're stalking her. (then, looks at him --) You're not still going by there, are you? 
SEBASTIAN No. A beat. 
Then -- SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) They've turned it into a tapas-samba place. 
You believe that? 
LAURA Seb -- SEBASTIAN Who wants to tapas while they samba? 
LAURA I have someone I want you to meet. 
SEBASTIAN I don't want to meet anyone. 
LAURA You'll like her. 
SEBASTIAN Uh-huh. 
Does she like jazz? 
LAURA Probably not. 
SEBASTIAN Then what are we gonna talk about? 
LAURA You'll talk about the weather. 
SEBASTIAN Ok. Then I have someone I'd like you to meet. 
He's got a face tattoo, but a heart of gold. 
Revision 12. 
LAURA Sebastian -- SEBASTIAN How long's it been? 
LAURA You need to get serious. 
You live like a hermit. 
You're driving without insurance. 
SEBASTIAN I am serious. 
I had a very serious plan for my future. 
It's not my fault I got Shanghai'ed. 
LAURA You did not get "Shanghai'ed", you got ripped off. 
SEBASTIAN What's the difference? 
LAURA It's not as romantic as that. (she starts to walk off) And everyone knew that guy was shady except for you. 
SEBASTIAN Why do you say romantic like it's a dirty word? 
LAURA Unpaid bills are not romantic. 
Call her. 
She heads to the door. 
He follows her, won't give it up -- SEBASTIAN You're acting like life's got me on the ropes -- what you don't understand is, I want to be on the ropes. 
I'm letting life hit me `til it gets tired. 
Then I'm gonna make my move. 
It's a classic rope-a-dope. 
Laura can't help but laugh. 
Stops by the door. 
Looks at him. 
LAURA I love you. 
Unpack your boxes. 
SEBASTIAN I'm changing the locks. 
Revision 13. 
LAURA (out the door with a smile --) You can't afford it. 
She's gone. 
Sebastian thinks for a beat, then calls out -- SEBASTIAN I'm a phoenix rising from the ashes! No reply to his triumphant declaration. 
He shuts the door. 
Looks again at the napkin. 
Thinks. 
Tosses it in the trash. 
A23 INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - LATER Moments later. 
Sebastian takes a slice of pizza from the fridge, pours himself some more coffee, places a Thelonious Monk LP onto a record player, and sits down at the piano. "Japanese Folk Song" -- the piece we heard in his car -- plays... 
Sebastian plays along. 
Stops. 
Moves the record back a few bars. 
Starts it again. 
Plays the same passage over. 
Stops. 
Moves the record back a second time. 
Plays the passage again. 
Stops. 
Over and over, just like in his car -- until, finally, he gets it right. 
He keeps playing, louder now, and we're -- B23 OMIT 24 OMIT 25 OMIT 26 OMIT 27 INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT A red-booth bar-and-restaurant. 
Christmas decorations all over. 
Sebastian steps in. 
Immediately beelining over -- BOSS Seb. 
SEBASTIAN (putting on a smile) Bill. 
Thanks for having me back. 
BOSS Your welcome. 
Stick to the set list. 
Revision 14. 
SEBASTIAN Of course. (under his breath as he heads to the piano) Though I don't think they care what I play. 
BOSS I do, and I don't want to hear the free jazz. 
SEBASTIAN How `bout one for you, one for me? 
Or two for you, one for me? (the Boss just glares) Or all for you, none for me? 
Ok, that works. 
Good deal. 
Sebastian sits down at the keys. 
A WAITRESS passes by. 
WAITRESS Well... 
Welcome back. 
SEBASTIAN There's a nice way to say that. 
With that -- he starts playing "Jingle Bells". 28 INT. RESTAURANT - LATER The restaurant's demographic has changed. 
It's now younger stragglers wandering in. 
Sebastian looks beyond bored. 
He finishes "We Wish You a Merry Christmas". 
Zero applause. 
He begins a new chart: "Deck the Halls". 
But something seems to come over him now. 
He's restless. 
Slowly, his playing drifts off -- his fingers charting their own path... 
And then -- we hear a melody. 
The one Mia heard outside. 
The one we'll refer to from now on as Mia and Sebastian's song... 
The door opens -- and Mia steps in. 
She sees Sebastian at the piano. 
Is instantly struck by his playing. [MIA AND SEBASTIAN'S THEME] Gradually -- all sounds but the music drop out. 
We drift away from reality. 
Even the walls seem to go slightly darker -- as though Sebastian and Mia were all alone... 
He concludes his piece with a jumble of chords, his playing almost free jazz now, as we pull back to real life... ...and see the Boss looking on in scorn. 
Revision 15. 
Sebastian finishes. 
Silence. 
Mia looks like the wind has been knocked out of her. 
Sebastian looks up for a second -- and sees her. 
They look at one another. 
Just a moment. 
Then -- the Boss taps Sebastian on the shoulder. 
WE STAY ON Mia as she watches Sebastian rise with the Boss. 
We just see the Boss talking to Sebastian, can't hear what is said. 
Then, we get closer -- and realize: BOSS ...every goddamned night. 
Sebastian is silent. 
Then, doesn't want to have to beg but -- SEBASTIAN I'll stick to the set list, I promise -- BOSS Too late. 
You're done. 
SEBASTIAN You're not gonna find a better player. 
You know that. 
BOSS (leans in, and --) Do you think anyone here gives a shit? 
With that, the Boss walks off. 
We linger on Sebastian. 
Anger giving way -- to hurt. 
He starts hurrying toward the door. 
BACK TO Mia -- who didn't hear what was said. 
She watches Sebastian -- takes a breath, so moved that she's about to lay it all out -- swoops in to corner him -- and -- MIA I just wanted to say -- I saw your playing, and I -- -- but Sebastian just walks right by -- his shoulder bumping against Mia's for an added measure of disdain. 
He heads out the door. 
Slams it shut. 
Mia is left standing on her own. 
She looks like she's just been slapped. 
SMASH CUT TO BLACK. Revision 16. 
SPRING 29 OMIT 30 INT. AUDITION ROOMS - DAY Mia auditions. 
Pilot season cattle-call -- a series of soul- crushing try-outs. 
She's pandering to the hilt. 
Quick glimpses: MIA (CONT'D) I don't like the fissure on the GT scan. 
Did you test for achromatopsia? 31 Then, a second audition -- MIA (CONT'D) D.O.A. on 23rd, perp laughing his face off at P.D. 
Damn Miranda Rights. 32 And finally, a third audition -- MIA (CONT'D) This is my classroom. 
You don't like it, the door's to my left. 
READER (O.S.) (a well-dressed forty-year-old WOMAN reading from sides) Lady why you be trippin' like that? 
MIA No, Jamal. 
You be trippin'. 34 EXT. PARTY - DAY Mia wanders around another party. 
A BAD 80's COVER BAND plays. 
TRACY There you are! You need to meet someone! Carlo, this is Mia. 
Mia, Carlo's a writer. 
CARLO TRACY Nice to meet you, Mia. 
He's got projects all over town. 
CARLO (shrugs, faux-modest) They say I have a knack for world-building. 
MIA (takes this in; then --) Congratulations. 
I have to grab a drink... 
Revision 17. 
She slips away. 
Presses toward the bar. 
The music gets louder, more obnoxious. 
She peers toward the band to get a look... 
And then she sees him. 
Sebastian. 
Playing keyboard-guitar for the band. 
Dressed up like his band- mates in a bright polyester outfit. 
And hating every second. 
The band finishes, and the SINGER addresses the (thin) crowd. 
SINGER Alright, one more for y'all before we break. 
Do I hear any requests? 
MIA "I Ran". 
Sebastian turns. 
Sees Mia, looking at him with a defiant grin, enjoying her power. 
He thinks -- then recognizes the face. 
SINGER "I Ran" it is. (to Sebastian) Wanna start us off, piano-man? 
Sebastian stays silent. 
Mortified. 
Finally, so reluctant, he taps his keyboard to count the band in and begins playing. 
On the keys, it's a single note, repeated measure after measure. 
Mia knew this. 
Sebastian looks at her. 
She smiles right back. 
SINGER (CONT'D) I walked along the avenue... 35 EXT. PARTY / INT. HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER Set break. 
Sebastian hurries from the keys -- enters the house, looks both ways, finally spots Mia and -- SEBASTIAN Ok. I remember you. 
Mia looks at him. 
One eyebrow raised. 
Yeah? 
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) And I'm sorry if I was curt that night. 
MIA "Curt"? 
SEBASTIAN Ok I was an asshole. 
I can admit that. 
Revision 18. 
MIA Ok. SEBASTIAN But requesting "I Ran" from a serious musician -- it's too far. 
MIA My God. 
Did you just call yourself "a serious musician"? 
SEBASTIAN (beat) I don't think so. 
MIA Can I borrow what you're wearing? 
SEBASTIAN Why? 
MIA Because I have an audition next week. 
I'm playing a serious fire-fighter. 
SEBASTIAN (irritation building --) So you're an actress. 
That makes sense. 
Have I seen you in anything? 
MIA Uh... 
The coffee shop on the Warner Brothers lot. 
That's a classic. 
SEBASTIAN Oh, you're a barista. 
Well now I see how you can look down on me from all the way up there. 
SINGER (popping in from nowhere) Sebastian. 
Second set. 
Sebastian looks at Mia. 
She smirks. 
Pleased. 
The Singer walks off. 
SEBASTIAN He doesn't tell me what to do. 
MIA He just told you what to do. 
SEBASTIAN I let him. 
Revision 19. 
A beat. 
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) What's your name? 
MIA Mia. 
SEBASTIAN Mia. 
Guess I'll see you in the movies. 
He heads back to the keys, and the band resumes: SINGER Never seen you lookin' so lovely as you did tonight... 36 EXT. PARTY / STREET - NIGHT The party's finished. 
Sebastian exits, pulling out his keys, as we DRIFT and see a long line to the VALET. Standing way in the back, waiting, is Mia. 
She's stuck once again with CARLO, who's regaling her -- CARLO ...Goldilocks from the point of view of the bears. 
Home-invasion thriller. 
Fox and Warners are going crazy for it. 
Mia spots Sebastian, passing by the Valet with his keys. 
CARLO (CONT'D) ...We're going after Charlize. 
For the bear. 
We're flipping it. 
Feels like a franchise. 
But the thing is it's grounded. 
MIA (to Sebastian) George Michael! Sebastian stops. 
Looks at her. 
Surprised. 
SEBASTIAN You again. 
MIA Did you just get your keys? 
Sebastian thinks. 
Sees the Valet. 
Playing it off -- SEBASTIAN ...Yeah. 
Revision 20. 
MIA Can you grab mine? 
SEBASTIAN ...Which one is it? 
MIA The Prius. 
A beat. 
Sebastian turns to the Valet's box. 
Motions to the Valet: Sorry. 
One second. 
Looks. 
All the keys are Prius keys. 
MIA (CONT'D) The one with the green ribbon. 
Another beat. 
Sebastian finds it. 
Grabs it. 37 EXT. STREET - NIGHT Mia and Sebastian trudge up a hill lined with cars. 
Mia aims her key fob. 
No beep. 
Sebastian points his own keys, also aiming for a beep. 
Silence. 
They've been at this for a while. 
MIA (CONT'D) (almost tripping in her heels) Shit... 
SEBASTIAN Those look comfortable. 
MIA They are...n't. 
A beat. 
She aims again. 
No beep. 
MIA (CONT'D) Thank you for saving the day back there. 
SEBASTIAN You didn't give me much of a choice. 
MIA Strange that we keep running into each other. 
SEBASTIAN It is strange. 
Maybe it means something. 
MIA I doubt it. 
SEBASTIAN Yeah I don't think so either. 
Revision 21. 
On that, Mia aims again. 
As always -- no beep. 
Noticing -- SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Put the clicker under your chin. 
MIA What? 
Sebastian demonstrates with his fob. 
He looks idiotic. 
SEBASTIAN It turns your head into an antenna. 
Probably gives you cancer, but you find your car more quickly. 
MIA Uh-huh. 
SEBASTIAN You don't live as long, but you get things done faster, so it all evens out. 
MIA Oh my God. 
Just then, they reach a clearing -- AND THE CITY SKYLINE APPEARS BELOW. A ribbon of lights, stretching as far as you can see. 
It's the most romantic sight imaginable. 
They look at each other. 
A beat. 
And then -- MIA (CONT'D) Eh. They walk on, the lights shimmering behind. 
SEBASTIAN Not much to look at. 
MIA Agreed. 
I've seen better. 
And on that -- they SING. [A LOVELY NIGHT] Mia and Sebastian try to downplay the romanticism of this setting, this moment -- being lost here, at night, alone together, atop a hill, the city glittering before them. 
It's "no big deal", nothing they haven't seen or felt before -- because, after all, there's no chance for romance between them... 
Of course, the music, swelling and building, suggests otherwise. 
Mia tires of her heels, finds a bench and fishes for flats in her handbag. 
Sebastian sits beside her as she slips the flats on. 
They look at each other, suspicious... 
Revision 22. 
He moves his foot. 
She moves hers. 
They look at each other again. 
Still suspicious... 
He moves again. 
She moves again. 
They seem to be moving in sync -- without their even wanting to... 
And -- bit by bit -- before our eyes -- they've almost slipped into DANCE... 
Sebastian rises. 
Mia rises as well. 
The two look at each other. 
Run back to the bench, hop atop it -- the lights stretch out like a magic carpet. 
They share a moment -- share a look -- jump off -- AND START REALLY DANCING NOW... 
Mia does a move, Sebastian responds. 
Sebastian does a move, Mia shakes her head: "Nope". 
They make the road their own, growing more and more energized, as surprised as we are to find -- ...that they can really dance together. 
Just as this starts to look like a blossoming romance, real joy peeking through, our two heroes getting closer and closer and closer, looking at each other almost giddily... ...a sound cuts through. 
It's a CELL PHONE ring. 
Mia and Sebastian turn -- to her handbag, back by the bench. 
Snapped out of it, Mia heads over and pulls out her cell. 
MIA (CONT'D) Hey... 
Greg...? 
Can you hear me...? 
Yeah, I'm just leaving now... 
K, see you soon... 
She hangs up. 
Looks at Sebastian. 
An awkward silence. 
Finally -- she presses her fob again. 
Puts it under her chin this time. 
A BEEP can be heard. 
They see her Prius. 
MIA (CONT'D) Ah. Great... 
Well... 
Do you want a ride to your car? 
SEBASTIAN No, that's fine... 
Thanks... 
MIA ...Ok... 
Not sure what else to say, she heads to her vehicle. 
Waves. 
MIA (CONT'D) Night. 
Sebastian waves back. 
Mia drives off. 
Fast. 
Silence... 
Revision 23. 
Looking even more disappointed than he thought he'd be, Sebastian walks on for a bit -- then retreats back down. 
A37 Comes to a stop across from the party, and we see his Riviera -- right, it seems, where he knew it was all along. 
He pulls out his keys -- they don't have a clicker after all. 38 OMIT 39 INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY CLOSE on -- CUSTOMER Are these pastries gluten-free? 
Mia's at work. 
A typically chaotic day. 
MIA No... 
CUSTOMER What?? 
I want a refund. 
Mia nods, heads to the Manager -- MANAGER You're closing up Friday. 
MIA I have an audition. 
Remember? 
MANAGER Do I look like I care? 
Reschedule it. 
MIA But you said -- MANAGER And fix your apron. 
With that, the Manager walks off. 
Mia is silent for a moment -- wants to talk back but needs this job -- then turns -- and sees Sebastian at the counter. 
MIA ...Hi. (then) What are you doing here? 
SEBASTIAN Meetings. 
Studio heads. 
Revision 24. 
MIA Uh-huh. 
How'd you get on the lot? 
SEBASTIAN Piece of cake. 
Mia looks at him. 
He's sweating through his shirt. 
A beat. 
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Actually it took me four hours and I ended up running. 
We probably have twenty minutes before the guy finds me. 
You got a break coming up? 
Mia laughs. 
A moment. 
MIA I'm off in ten. 
SEBASTIAN Great. 
I'll hide in the bathroom. 40 EXT. COFFEE SHOP / STUDIO LOT - DAY Mia exits, apron off. 
She and Sebastian start walking. 
She points across the street -- to the façade of a Parisian apartment. 
MIA That's the window Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart looked out of in Casablanca. 
Sebastian nods. 
They start walking. 
SEBASTIAN What's your Bogart's name...? (Mia looks at him) Is it Greg? 
MIA Yeah. 
Greg. 
SEBASTIAN How long have...? 
MIA We've been seeing each other for a few months. 
An awkward beat. 
They pass a wooden SALOON -- where a WESTERN is being shot. 
Extras in COWBOY costumes drink coffee on the steps. 
Revision 25. 
MIA (CONT'D) I love this stuff. 
Makes coming to work easier. 
SEBASTIAN I know what you mean. 
I get breakfast five miles out of the way just to sit outside a jazz club. 
MIA Oh yeah? 
SEBASTIAN It was called Van Beek. 
The swing bands played there. 
Count Basie. 
Chick Webb. (then,) It's a samba-tapas place now. 
MIA A what? 
SEBASTIAN Samba-tapas. 
It's... 
Exactly. 
The joke's on history. 
Mia laughs. 
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Anyway, that's L.A. 
They worship everything and they value nothing. 
They reach a patch of green. 
Another shoot. 
A P.A. yells out: P.A. 
Clear the frame! MIA (to Sebastian) We need to wait here. 
SEBASTIAN I know. 
They shoot movies on my street. "C-stands." "Apple box." "Don't forget to sign out." Mia laughs. 
A beat. 
A.D. (O.S.) Quiet on set! Mia and Sebastian watch the cameras roll. 
Then, in a whisper -- SEBASTIAN How'd you get into all this? 
Revision 26. 
MIA Into...? 
Oh -- I -- my aunt was an actress. 
She was in this traveling theater company... 
And there was this little library across the street from my house when I was growing up. 
This was Boulder City, Nevada -- every house looked exactly the same. 
I was ten and already I needed to get out. 
And one day, my aunt flew into town, and she showed me the library's old-movie section. 
We spent a whole day watching one after the other. 
Bringing Up Baby. 
Notorious. 
Casablanca. (a beat; then,) I never knew the world was so big. 
DIRECTOR (O.S.) Cut! Mia and Sebastian resume walking. 
Now, at full volume -- MIA I started putting on plays in my garage. 
I'd write the scripts and print up programs, and she'd give me props to use from wherever she'd just been -- New York, London, Paris. 
And then she'd jet off again and I wouldn't hear from her for another year. 
SEBASTIAN Who would you invite to watch? 
Your parents? 
MIA God no -- I didn't invite anyone. 
That would have been terrifying. 
C40 CUT TO: The entrance to a giant soundstage. 
MIA (CONT'D) Honestly, I wish I loved something else. 
I've tried so hard to want other things. 
She and Sebastian stop. 
Peer inside the stage. 
MIA (CONT'D) I left school after two years to come here, my fourth manager just dropped me, and my last audition was for a teen soap pitched as Dangerous Minds meets The O.C. (a beat; then, deadpan --) Should've been a lawyer. 
Revision 27. 
They resume walking. 
D40 CUT TO: A row of closed soundstages, sandy-tan against the bright blue sky. 
SEBASTIAN ...`Cause the world needs more lawyers. 
MIA Well it doesn't need more actresses. 
SEBASTIAN You're not just an actress. 
MIA What do you mean, "just an actress"? 
SEBASTIAN You said it yourself, you're a child- prodigy playwright. 
MIA That is not what I said. 
SEBASTIAN You're too modest to say it but it's true. 
So you could write your own roles. 
Write something that's as interesting as you are. 
MIA Last thing I wrote was a stand-up routine for an open-mic night. 
It was horrible. 
SEBASTIAN All I'm saying is -- Louis Armstrong could have played the marching-band charts he was given. 
What did he do instead? 
He made history. 
MIA Ok, I'll stop auditioning and make history instead. 
Sebastian laughs. 
MIA (CONT'D) Anyway -- I'm getting a feeling there's something I should tell you... 
SEBASTIAN Yeah? 
Revision 28. 
MIA I hate jazz. 
Sebastian stops. 
Turns to her. 
SEBASTIAN What does that mean? "I hate jazz"? 
MIA It means when I listen to it I don't like it. 
SEBASTIAN But it's such a blanket statement. 
It's like saying "I hate animals". 
MIA I do hate some animals. 
SEBASTIAN Do you need to be anywhere right now? 
Mia looks at him. 
We hear DRUMS. A swinging ride pattern. 
And we're in -- 41 INT. LIGHTHOUSE CAFE - DAY -- an old-school JAZZ CLUB. It's almost empty, only aged JAZZ CATS here -- except for Mia and Sebastian, watching a QUARTET... 
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Most people say they hate jazz because they don't have context. 
They don't get where it came from. 
All these people packed into flophouses in New Orleans, speaking five different languages, and jazz was how they talked to each other. 
MIA I thought it was just Kenny G. 
SEBASTIAN ...What? 
Mia looks at him. 
Already knows just how to get to him. 
MIA I associate it with facials. 
It's relaxing. 
SEBASTIAN It's not relaxing! Sid Bechet got into a gunfight `cause somebody told him he played a wrong note! Revision 29. 
MIA (laying it on thick) Right, but it's good to talk over. 
Where I grew up there's this jazz station they'd play at cocktail parties whenever they served the salami and cheese. 
SEBASTIAN Mia. 
These are things you can't unsay. 
She bursts into laughter. 
Sebastian points to the band -- SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) It's not cocktail music -- it's a high- wire act. 
These guys are performing and composing and rearranging all at once. 
A beat. 
Mia looks at the band. 
We DRIFT over the instruments... 
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) That's why you need to be in the space and see what's at stake. 
This whole thing -- it's dying. 
In twenty minutes they'll head off to cut commercial sessions or do pit at the Pantages `cause they have to -- but when I have my own place -- my club -- they'll play whatever they want. 
Mia looks at Sebastian. 
Her laughter has subsided. 
She can see something in him now -- the same passion he's speaking of... 
MIA Your club? 
SEBASTIAN ...It's gonna be the old Van Beek. 
I'm getting the lease back. 
It'll be perfect. 
He watches the band. 
Lost in the sound. 
Then -- sincere -- SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) The world tells everyone to move on. 
Says the music's had its moment. 
But I love it too much. 
I'm not moving on. 
The band finishes. 
The ride cymbal sizzles in the air... 
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) So? He looks at Mia. 
She's visibly moved. 
Just then -- we hear a BEEP. Mia looks at her phone. 
Revision 30. 42 INT. SIDE CORRIDOR - LIGHTHOUSE CAFE - CONTINUOUS MIA Hi, I just missed a call... 43 INT. LIGHTHOUSE CAFE - MOMENTS LATER Mia steps out, dazed. 
Sebastian's listening to a new tune. 
He spots Mia, turns to her -- as, shouting over the music -- MIA (CONT'D) I got a call-back! SEBASTIAN Really? 
For what? 
MIA That show I told you about. 
SEBASTIAN Dangerous Minds meets The O.C.? MIA Right. 
It's -- actually more like Rebel Without a Cause. 
SEBASTIAN That's amazing! "I got the bulletsssss!" Mia laughs. 
But Sebastian can tell something in her laugh... 
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) You've seen it, right? 
MIA Obviously. (a beat; then --) No. SEBASTIAN What? 
You're the movie person. 
MIA It's the one I lie about. 
SEBASTIAN Come on. 
You can't do this audition and never see Rebel. 
The theater near me's playing it. 
If you want -- I can take you. 
For research. 
MIA (considering this) ...Ok. Revision 31. 
SEBASTIAN 10pm Monday at the Rialto. 
Cool? 
MIA Ok. (another nod, taking it in) For research. 
Mia looks at him -- he looks at her -- each of them suppressing a newfound giddiness... 
And on that -- 44 EXT. LIGHTHOUSE CAFE - EVENING Mia and Sebastian exit. 
Wave "good-bye". 
We FOLLOW Sebastian. 
He rounds the corner, nears the Hermosa Beach pier... ...and begins to SING. [CITY OF STARS] Lifted by a strange new feeling -- a feeling he wasn't expecting. 
The feeling that perhaps -- just perhaps -- he's falling in love... 
He gazes out at the sea, the purple sky. 
Dances with an OLD COUPLE, then continues on his way, as though caught in a dream. 
There's an uncertainty in his singing -- he's not sure if this dream will sustain. 
But for now, it's a beautiful feeling... 
The MUSIC simmers down -- and WE FADE OUT. 45 EXT. AUDITION BUILDING - DAY A Pasadena building. 
As Mia approaches the door, another cell ring. 
It's her MOM. This time, Mia is happy to get the call: MIA (CONT'D) Hi, Mom! MIA'S MOM (O.S.) Hi, sweetie. 
How are you? 
MIA Great, actually: I got a call-back on a pilot. 
MIA'S MOM (O.S.) Oh my God! You're going to be on TV?? MIA Well -- it's not picked up yet. 
MIA'S MOM (O.S.) Not picked up? 
MIA First they make the pilot, then if they like the pilot it goes on TV. Revision 32. 
MIA'S MOM (O.S.) And you're in the pilot? 
MIA Well, no, I have a call-back. 
MIA'S MOM (O.S.) I see... 
Didn't you audition for a TV thing last week? 
MIA It's another audition. 
MIA'S MOM (O.S.) I see... 
So you might get a role in a thing that might one day be put on TV... 
MIA ...Well when you put it like that it sounds like a huge accomplishment. 
MIA'S MOM (O.S.) No, I don't mean that, it's so exciting. 
What channel? 
ABC? HBO? MIA Oxygen. 
MIA'S MOM (O.S.) Oxygen? 
MIA You know what, I have to go. 
I love you. 
She hangs up. 
Takes a deep breath. 
Enters the building. 46 INT. WAITING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER Mia sits, starts reviewing her script. 
Looks around her -- the room is filled with ACTRESSES silently MOUTHING THEIR LINES. It's a bizarre sight: a dozen women moving their mouths, with no sound coming out at all. 
What's more, they're all in variations of the same type of costume: Michelle Pfeiffer's leather jacket from Dangerous Minds. 
A few stare at Mia, sizing her up. 
In the corner, another one of them GRUNTS while performing stretches. 
Then -- a DOOR to the side opens, and Mia can hear -- DIRECTOR (O.S.) ...We'll be seeing you very soon. 
Revision 33. 
An ACTRESS exits. 
Absolutely beaming. 
And then, a bored voice -- ASSISTANT Mia Dolan? 47 INT. AUDITION ROOM - MOMENTS LATER Mia steps in. 
The pilot's DIRECTOR is seated at a table, looking in his folder at Mia's head-shot. 
He looks up at Mia. 
DIRECTOR Whenever you're ready. 
Mia breathes in. 
Heart pounding. 
Sweat percolating. 
Has been practicing this for days now. 
Fighting her nerves, she begins -- MIA Two options. 
Follow my rules, or follow my rules. 
Kapish? 
You want to bully, you'd best be ready to get bullied -- DIRECTOR Thanks. 
Mia is taken aback. 
MIA I can do it another way -- DIRECTOR No, thanks, that was great. 
We linger on Mia for a moment, and then -- 48 EXT. PARKING LOT / INT. MIA'S CAR - DAY Crestfallen, humiliated, Mia hurries to her car. 
Sees a voice- mail on her cell. 
Plays it -- MIA'S MOM (O.S.) Dad just helped me find Oxygen on the guide! So exciting! So will you be getting health insurance now? 
Mia switches her phone off and drives. 
Clenches her jaw. 
Turns left and sees a movie theater. 
The Rialto. 
Manages a smile. 
Something she can remain upbeat about... 
Revision 34. 49 INT. MIA'S APARTMENT - DAY Mia in her room, sorting through outfits. 
Slips into jeans -- ALEXIS Mia? -- then spins around, startled. 
Alexis is at the door, eating Fritos. 
Has been crying. 
ALEXIS (CONT'D) (with difficulty) Greg's here... 
Mia looks at Alexis -- completely confused. 
Then -- Greg steps out behind Alexis. 
Waves to her. 
GREG Hey... 
I'm parked out front. 
But we should hurry, my brother just landed. 
Mia looks at him, still confused. 
Then remembers. 
GREG (CONT'D) Did you forget? 
MIA Shit. 
No. Yes. 
I'll change... 
GREG (smiles) It's ok. 
Mia closes her door -- turns -- and we see her face. 
She's crushed. 
She goes to call Sebastian -- then freezes. 
Remembers something else. 
She never got his number... 
We linger on her face, as, on his phone outside her door -- GREG (O.S.) (CONT'D) Josh! Yep, just picking Mia up now. 
Will be there in twenty. 50 INT. LIGHTHOUSE CAFE - NIGHT Sebastian's playing a jam session. 
Excited, distracted. 10pm can't come quickly enough. 51 INT. JAR - NIGHT Mia, in a green dress, with Greg, his brother JOSH, and Josh's FIANCEE. The restaurant is posh, modern. 
Josh wears a Brooks Brothers suit: he seems better-off than his brother. 
Revision 35. 
JOSH That's right -- but now we've got a surround-sound set-up, so it's like -- FIANCEE It's like being in a movie theater. 
JOSH It's better than going to a theater, really. 
You know theaters these days -- GREG Oh, sure -- JOSH -- they're so dirty, and they're either too hot or too cold, and there's always people talking, which is just -- (his phone buzzes) -- just so annoying, I mean you're trying to watch a movie -- one second -- (opens phone) Hello?... 
His Fiancée smiles, looks at Greg and Mia, proud. 
FIANCEE Probably work. 
JOSH Yeah, I'll have to call you back. (closes and pockets his phone) So, yeah, we love it. 
Awkward silence. 
Mia hasn't spoken a word. 52 EXT. RIALTO MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT Sebastian paces. 
People shuffle in. 
He looks. 
No sign of Mia. 53 INT. JAR - NIGHT Midway through the meal. 
Mia is bored, restless, uneasy. 
JOSH (CONT'D) One word for you. 
Nicaragua. 
GREG I've never heard anyone say that. 
Was it amazing? 
Revision 36. 
JOSH Oh my God. 
A five-star jungle eco-resort. 
It was unbelievable. 
Mia stays quiet, in her own thoughts, the voices around her fading away. 
And then she hears it -- coming from the restaurant speakers, peeking out subtly at first: the melody we now know so well... 
Her and Sebastian's song. 
She FREEZES. The radio music seems to have morphed into the melody, and the tune stirs something deep within her... 
A few seconds pass. 
And then she can't deny it any longer. 
It's clear as day to her now. 
She rises from her seat -- GREG Mia? -- looks at Greg -- MIA I'm sorry. -- and -- as the sounds of a FULL ORCHESTRA swoop in -- -- RUNS out of the restaurant as fast as she can. 54 EXT. JAR - NIGHT The MUSIC SWELLS, strings carrying us through and lifting Mia's spirits as she runs down the street in her green dress, for once absolutely sure of what she's doing... 55 INT. RIALTO MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT Inside the Rialto, Sebastian settling into his seat, the show about to begin. 
He's visibly disappointed that he's alone. 
The lights dim. 
Projector light cuts through the darkness. 
And then, as the movie's credits start up, Sebastian spots, out of the corner of his eye, a figure in the aisle... 
He looks. 
The figure turns. 
Looks at him. 
It's Mia. 
And, caught like a freeze-frame in the projector light, her green dress incandescent, the giant movie screen behind her like a great piece of back-projection, she looks more beautiful than ever right now. 
A true old-fashioned screen siren. 
Sebastian's eyes go wide. 
He's surprised. 
And thrilled. 
He waves. 
Mia hurries toward him. 
Takes the seat next to his, as Rebel Without a Cause begins... 
Revision 37. 56 INT. RIALTO MOVIE THEATER - LATER Half an hour has passed. 
The movie plays, lights flickering on Mia and Sebastian's darkened faces. 
He puts his arm on the armrest, she moves hers nervously. 
He scoots to his right, she scoots back. 
She edges her elbow onto the armrest, he moves his arm. 
Inch by inch, their bodies grow closer. 
Hands approaching, breaths quickening, hearts pounding... ...until finally their hands touch... 
And then, suddenly -- just as James Dean and Natalie Wood arrive at Griffith Observatory, and Mia and Sebastian seem about to kiss -- -- burn marks streak their way across the image. 
The screen goes blank. 
Silence. 
The lights go on. 
Mia and Sebastian turn around. 
AUDIENCE MEMBERS start murmuring. 
Sebastian can barely believe his bad luck. 
But then Mia turns to him. 
Energized. 
MIA (CONT'D) I have an idea. 57 EXT. ROAD - NIGHT Sebastian's car, traveling up a winding road, stars glittering above it, the lights of Los Angeles glittering below it. 
The sky is a deep, painted blue. 
Music plays... [PLANETARIUM] The car is bending around the turns, making its way up to... 
A57 ...the real Griffith Observatory. 
There, our MUSIC crests. 
Our two characters get out of the car and wander, searching for an open entrance. 
They find one -- and sneak in... 58 INT. GRIFFITH OBSERVATORY - CONTINUOUS They ascend a staircase. 
Make their way past the exhibits -- the Tesla coil shooting off electric bolts. 
They reach the pendulum, gaze up at the mural above it, look at one another. 
Circle the pendulum, and then -- so tenderly, so nervously... 
Revision 38. ...they begin to DANCE. This is a dance that fulfills all the promise in their earlier duet. 
They circle the floor, gently and gracefully. 
The music BUILDS, and they drift into... 
A58 ...the PLANETARIUM. It's darkened, empty. 
Mia removes her shoes, feels the soft carpet under her feet. 
Turns on the projector. 
The screen STARTS TO GLOW. She and Sebastian take in the sight -- the STARS and GALAXIES... 
Enchanted, they look at one another, the lights from the screen reflected on their faces. 
They approach, as though about to kiss... 
When -- -- Mia's shoes LIFT UP. Float toward the ceiling -- toward the star-filled screen. 
She and Sebastian trade looks. 
Realize. 
And then they too begin to FLOAT... ...RISING from the floor, nothing stopping them. 
SOARING past the views of comets and moons and nebulae. 
Eyes wide, their emotions seized, as they HOLD EACH OTHER TIGHT... 
And so unspools a gravity-free dance. 
Mia and Sebastian SPIN and TWIRL through the planetarium as though they themselves were in outer space, flying through the cosmos. 
The music carries them higher and higher, and their spirits likewise soar -- JOYOUS, EXUBERANT -- until, finally... ...the music SOFTENS. Mia and Sebastian drift back to the floor like feathers. 
They land on a pair of seats. 
There, once again seated like audience members at a movie, they turn and look into each other's eyes. 
The music picks back up for the big finish, as the lovers lean in and -- in true movie- movie old-Hollywood big-musical fashion -- -- LOCK LIPS. It's their first kiss, and it's a kiss to remember -- full of all the hope and yearning and terror and wonder of love's first blush. 
A swoon-worthy kiss, with the orchestra soaring and the camera swooping in to catch the embrace in all its glory. 
On this triumphant moment... ...we IRIS FADE OUT. Revision 39. 59 OMIT 60 INT. MIA'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY Mia's scribbling in a notebook. 
It's dialogue. 
We see character headings, scene headings. 
Seems to be some kind of a script... 
TRACY (O.S.) What's that? 
Mia turns. 
Tracy has wandered in -- pajamas, eating cereal. 
TRACY (CONT'D) Is that a script? 
MIA It's a play. 
I'm going to put it on myself. 
ALEXIS (O.S.) (chiming in from her bedroom) A play? 
You better give us roles! MIA Actually -- it's a -- it's a one-woman show... 
A beat -- and then -- AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHT. HONKING outside the nearest window. 
It's a honk we recognize: TRACY ...Is that gonna happen every time? 
MIA (glowing) I think so. 
A60 OMIT 61 EXT. MIA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY Mia dashes out -- and LEAPS into Sebastian's car and into his arms. 
They KISS -- giddy, emotional, as though they'd been separated for years. 
Sebastian drives off -- when -- MIA (O.S.) (CONT'D) It's one-way!! The car SCREECHES to a stop in front of a TRUCK going the opposite direction. 
Sebastian goes into REVERSE as Mia cracks up laughing. 
A BURST OF MUSIC as a title card pops on: Revision 40. 
SUMMER The MUSIC carries us through the following series of GLIMPSES: 62 -- Mia and Sebastian ambling past weathered 30's bungalows in BUNKER HILL... 63 -- Mia guiding Sebastian down a street peppered with SILENT- ERA HOMES, past old gas-lamps and palms... 65 -- VAN BEEK. Sebastian gestures to the "TAPAS & TUNES" sign. 
Excitedly tries to deface it. 
Mia, aghast, pulls him back... 66 -- The HUNTINGTON GARDENS, where Mia and Sebastian gaze at the tiny forest... 
A66 -- WATTS TOWERS, where the two lovers stroll and kiss... 67 OMIT 64 -- The GRAND CENTRAL MARKET, where they grab food... 68 -- ANGEL'S FLIGHT at night, where they stumble and slip into a tipsy, love-soaked dance... 69 OMIT Interspersed throughout, WE SEE IMAGES OF LOS ANGELES: 1940's high-rises, green movie-movie lettering, ochre walls shaded by palm fronds, red flowers and Spanish missions, old lamps and Art Deco hotels. 
It's a gorgeous city, and the music only makes it more gorgeous -- building and carrying us to... 70 INT. LIGHTHOUSE CAFE - NIGHT A Lighthouse JAM SESSION. Sebastian's at the keys, having a blast. 
The place is again mostly empty, but Mia is dancing her heart out. 
She shoots looks at Sebastian. 
He laughs, plays out for her. 
The two of them are in their own world -- one of pure, unadulterated JOY... 
The song ends. 
Sebastian rises, joins Mia. 
They sit down as the band strikes up a new tune, and kiss. 
KEITH (O.S.) Sebastian? 
Mia and Sebastian look up, startled. 
A YOUNG MAN, 35, is standing next to them. 
Tall, fierce eyes. 
This is KEITH. SEBASTIAN Keith? 
Revision 41. 
KEITH Holy shit. 
Come here, man. 
Sebastian gets up. 
Gives him a hug. 
But Mia can sense an unease in Sebastian's eyes. 
It's a strained hug. 
SEBASTIAN This is Mia. 
Mia, Keith. (explaining to Mia) We used to play together. 
KEITH MIA Hey, Mia. 
Hey... 
Sebastian sits back down. 
Wants to end the conversation. 
KEITH So how've you been? 
SEBASTIAN Great. 
You? 
KEITH Keeping busy. 
Got a new combo. 
SEBASTIAN Good for you. 
KEITH ...Looking for keys. 
SEBASTIAN (after a beat) I'm good. 
KEITH You sure? 
It pays. 
Sebastian looks at Keith. 
A moment. 
SEBASTIAN I'm good. 
Keith almost smiles. 
Expected this. 
KEITH Let's just grab a drink then. 
Call me. 
It's been too long. 
SEBASTIAN You bet. 
KEITH Nice meeting you, Mia. 
Revision 42. 
MIA Nice meeting you. 
Keith walks off. 
Mia and Sebastian look at each other. 
Then -- 71 INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT CLOSE ON MIA. She looks anxious. 
CLOSE ON Sebastian. 
He looks head-over-heels in love. 
SEBASTIAN It's beautiful. 
MIA ...You're just saying that. 
SEBASTIAN No... 
I'm not. 
We PULL BACK -- and see a script on Mia's lap. 
She's just finished reading Sebastian her play. 
MIA I don't know... 
Is the whole thing too nostalgic? 
SEBASTIAN That's the point. 
MIA But do you think people will like it? 
SEBASTIAN Fuck `em. 
MIA (laughs) You always say that. 
SEBASTIAN I truly believe it. 
MIA Fine -- as long as you sit front-row `cause I'll probably throw up on the middle of the stage otherwise. 
SEBASTIAN I'll be front-row. 
Mia looks at him. 
Smiles. 
It genuinely means the world to her. 
Then, a glow in her eyes, wants to reciprocate -- Revision 43. 
MIA I made something for you. 
She hops off the bed, fishes through a bag. 
Pulls out a drawing. 
SEBASTIAN What's that? 
MIA It could be the name design. 
On the door. 
SEBASTIAN Why does it say "Seb's"? 
MIA That's what you should name it. 
SEBASTIAN Never. 
MIA Sebastian, no one's going to a club called "Chicken on a Stick". 
SEBASTIAN You don't get it. 
Charlie Parker got the name "Bird" because he loved chicken. 
So my club's gonna be old-school jazz and beer and chicken. "Chicken on a Stick". 
MIA No. Drop the chicken. 
Drinks and jazz. (he rolls his eyes) And it's time to start looking for other places. 
SEBASTIAN It's gotta be Van Beek. 
I can't let them samba all over its history. 
MIA Make your own history. 
Sebastian looks at her. 
Appreciates that line. 
A beat. 
Then -- SEBASTIAN Your play's incredible. 
Mia smiles. 
He approaches her, sits by her side. 
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) The whole world from your bedroom? 
Who's doing that? 
Revision 44. 
MIA I'm doing that. 
They laugh. 
MIA (CONT'D) So who was that guy at the Lighthouse? 
SEBASTIAN ...Which guy? 
MIA The one who offered you a gig. 
SEBASTIAN You mean Keith? 
He's the worst. 
MIA Why was it weird between you two? 
SEBASTIAN It's always weird with him. 
MIA He did offer you a job. 
SEBASTIAN Right... 
MIA Are you going to call him? 
SEBASTIAN No. A beat. 
MIA Ok... 
A moment passes. 
They lie down, side by side. 
SEBASTIAN Here's what we know. 
It's definitely Chicken on a Stick -- (Mia rolls her eyes) -- and your play is going to be a triumph. 
She looks at him. 
He looks at her. 
A shared smile. 
And on that -- Revision 45. 72 INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - MORNING The next morning. 
Sebastian is in bed. 
Hears snatches of Mia's voice -- she's on her phone in the other room: MIA (O.S.) ...No, Mom, it's a one-woman show... 
No, I'm acting in it as well... 
No, I'm not getting paid, I'm paying to do it... (then,) He's great... 
He's going to open his own jazz club. 
It's going to be incredible... (beat; then, softer --) Well he has to get the money together first, and... 
He's figuring it out... 
Yeah, it's just been a little tricky lately... 
Sebastian listens. 
Takes it in. 
MIA (O.S.) (CONT'D) Look -- he's going to find a way to open it and you're going to love it. 
Ok? How's Dad? 
On Sebastian. 
He thinks... 73 INT. REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY Sebastian enters. 
Keith's combo is assembled. 
It's a sign-up practice room in the West Valley. 
There's a drummer, electric bassist, and trumpeter: COLE, MALCOLM and TOM. They're more polished in their looks than Sebastian. 
Well-groomed beards, tighter jeans. 
KEITH Sebastian. 
Sebastian approaches. 
KEITH (CONT'D) Didn't know if I'd see you today. 
SEBASTIAN (a bit awkward) Well... 
Here I am. 
A moment. 
Then -- SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Where's the piano? 
Keith gestures -- to an electronic keyboard. 
Sebastian winces. 
Revision 46. 
KEITH Here's the deal. 
We've got distribution with Universal, got our own imprint. 
We're about to go on the road. 
We can cut you in for 1K a week while we tour, plus an equal share of any merchandise or ticket revenue that comes in. 
Sound good? 
We see Sebastian's face. 
Taken aback. 
KEITH (CONT'D) Sebastian? 
SEBASTIAN Yeah, that...that... (beat) ...sounds good. 
A moment. 
Keith smiles. 
KEITH Let's play, see how it feels. 
He pulls out a guitar. 
Cole starts on drums. 
Keith joins in. 
Malcolm and Tom follow suit. 
Sebastian listens. 
It sounds like modern jazz -- electronic in feel, but still jazz... 
Sebastian approaches the keyboard. 
Joins -- slowly, one step at a time. 
Then begins playing out a bit more, his fingers starting to race. 
Malcolm gives Keith a look: "Damn". 
Keith gives Malcolm a look back: "I told you so." Bit by bit, Sebastian eases into the groove. 
This isn't so bad... 
Then -- Keith moves to a LAPTOP. Introduces a DRUM-MACHINE SAMPLE. Sebastian, into the music, is caught off-guard. 
Uneasy now. 
This isn't him... 
Keith plays a riff on his guitar. 
Tom echoes it on bass, then Malcolm on trumpet. 
Now it's Sebastian's turn. 
He hesitates. 
And then -- finally -- he plays the riff... 
It doesn't feel so bad. 
The guys build on the riff. 
Sebastian keeps up with them, trying to let go of his presuppositions. 
After all -- these guys can play... 
The music builds, the whole thing swelling and finally CARRYING US TO -- A73 LATER: Sebastian and Keith sit across from each other as the other players pack up. 
Sebastian looks pensive. 
Noticing -- Revision 47. 
KEITH (CONT'D) I know. 
It's different. 
Sebastian stays silent. 
Then, leaning in -- KEITH (CONT'D) But you say you want to save jazz. 
How are you going to save jazz if no one's listening? 
Jazz wouldn't exist if people hadn't gotten tired of what they were listening to before. (then,) I mean, do you really think a bunch of ninety-year-olds in a basement is the future of the form? 
Traditionalists whined when Kenny Clarke started dropping bombs. 
If traditionalists had their way, we'd still be playing Dixieland. 
Sebastian considers this. 
As much as he might make a play of resisting -- we can tell the words are getting to him... 
SEBASTIAN You're holding onto the past. 
But jazz is about the future. 
A moment. 
Then -- KEITH I get it. 
I got it wrong. 
Last guy wasn't as good as you. 
But you're a pain in the ass, man. 
Sebastian nods. 
Knows he can't argue with that. 
Another beat. 
KEITH (CONT'D) If it's not your thing, just let me know. 
I don't want you uncomfortable and trying to change this into something it's not. 
But if you want it -- the job's yours. 
Sebastian looks at Keith. 
A moment. 
He's really weighing this. 
And on that -- his look of uncertainty -- we're -- 74 OMIT 75 OMIT 76 OMIT 77 OMIT Revision 48. 77pt INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - DUSK The door opens. 
Mia enters. 
Takes a deep breath. 
Hears piano. 
Steps forward and sees Sebastian at his piano -- playing a melody we've heard before. [CITY OF STARS AS DUET] She smiles. 
Sebastian begins to SING. Mia sits down beside him and begins to SING as well. 
They share a duet -- simple, unaffected, hopeful -- the music just perhaps suggesting their uncertainty about what they might be about to do... 
As the vocals give way to instrumentation, we're -- A77 OMIT B77 OMIT C77 OMIT 78 INT. DINER - DAY Sebastian and Keith hunched over paperwork. 
Sebastian signs... 
A78 INT. COFFEE SHOP / STUDIO LOT - DAY Mia handing the Manager her apron. 
She's done with the job... 80 INT. PRACTICE SPACE - DAY The band rehearsing in their new PRACTICE SPACE. We see Sebastian play, see Keith sing this time... 79 INT. CAFE - DAY Mia hunched over her script, obsessively fine-tuning it... 81 OMIT 82 OMIT 83 INT. DESIGNER CLOTHING STORE - DAY Sebastian gets dressed up in a new suit... 84 INT. BLACK-BOX THEATER - DAY We follow Mia through a BLACK-BOX THEATER in North Hollywood. 
The space is small, simple -- but perfect. 
We see her haggle with the OWNER -- and then light up. 
They shake hands... 85 INT. GREEN ROOM - EVENING Sebastian and the band in a green room, waiting. 
Sebastian's wearing the new suit. 
Looking sharper... 
Revision 49. 86 INT. VINTAGE SHOP - DAY Mia looking for PROPS. Another wild assortment -- a TOP HAT, a CANE, a DIORAMA of London, rolled-up MAPS, an old GLOBE... 87 OMIT 88 INT. APARTMENT - DAY We MOVE IN on a laptop. 
On it a YOUTUBE video plays -- an interview with Sebastian, Keith and the rest of the band... 89 EXT. RIALTO - DAY Mia drives by the Rialto theater. 
It's now CLOSED... 90 INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT Mia sits on the floor, penciling out drawings for her play. 
Costume and poster sketches scattered by her feet. 
She's tired. 
The clock on the wall reads: 10:54pm. 
A90 INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT Mia gets into bed. 
Checks her phone. 
Turns off the light. 
B90 INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAWN Sebastian enters the apartment. 
Checks his reflection in the mirror -- a new addition. 
The clock reads: 4:57am. 
C90 INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAWN Sebastian gets into bed, careful not to wake Mia. 
D90 INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - MORNING Mia crosses through to the kitchen to get herself breakfast, careful not to wake Sebastian. 
The clock: 7:02am. 
E90 INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MORNING Sebastian in bed, fast asleep. 
And WE RETURN TO... 
F90 INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - DUSK ...Mia and Sebastian at the piano, before this latest journey began, finishing their song. 
The last lyrics resonating as they look into one another's eyes: SEBASTIAN MIA City of stars... 
You've never shined so brightly. 
Revision 50. 
On that -- this image of love, Sebastian playing out the final chords on his piano -- WE GO DARK. All sound fades out. 
And then, we hear -- -- a CROWD CHEERING. [START A FIRE] We see -- a white spotlight. 
It reveals Sebastian. 
We're -- 91 INT. THE ECHO - NIGHT Sebastian is on-stage. 
He's the only musician we can see. 
The floor beyond the stage is FILLED with people. 
Among them, we spot Mia -- beaming with pride. 
Sebastian sees her, smiles to her as he plays a piano intro. 
Mia grins right back, heart swelling... 
A SECOND SPOTLIGHT turns on, illuminating Keith. 
He SINGS. He has a beautiful voice. 
Mia bobs her head. 
It's just Keith and Sebastian right now, all acoustic, a simple, catchy tune... 
And then -- suddenly -- a DRUM MACHINE SURGES IN -- and -- BOOM! The entire CLUB is lit up as the MUSIC EXPLODES. A full- fledged dance beat and a thick radio-ready electronic track. 
Mia is taken aback. 
But she keeps bobbing her head -- as the crowd around her GOES CRAZY... 
Keith owns the stage, as Sebastian plays out more -- now switched to an electronic keyboard, complete with synth sounds. 
We recognize fragments of melody from when Keith and Sebastian first rehearsed -- but the tune has been transformed beyond recognition. 
Not a hint of jazz... 
Keith breaks into the CHORUS -- and a TRIO OF BACKUP SINGERS are revealed stage-left. 
The band surges into the song's bridge -- and BACKUP DANCERS appear stage-right, scantily- clad. 
And then -- the lights go NUTS. It's a full-out LIGHT SHOW now, shafts of red, blue, green and orange cutting through the dark. 
The crowd starts CHEERING, pumping their fists... 
Mia looks at Sebastian. 
He's not fighting any of this. 
He sees her. 
She smiles. 
But something is changing in her expression... 
She looks at the lights, the singers, the dancers, Sebastian and his bandmates in matching magazine-cover-ready outfits. 
She looks at the crowd around her -- their hollers growing more and more frenzied as Sebastian launches into a prolonged SOLO... 
Revision 51. 
Mia looks back at him, takes it all in: Is this really him...? 
As the mass of people swells and moves, Mia finds herself PUSHED TO THE SIDE, bit by bit, away from the center... 
She tries to hold her ground, but is edged FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY. Sebastian, deep in his solo, doesn't notice. 
Mia tugs against the tide of the crowd, but to no avail. 
She's pushed to the back of the club, away from the lights and into shadow... 
The final chorus begins -- floor-shaking, fist-pounding. 
We linger on Mia's face -- watching as the band feverishly tear into their climactic bars, the dancers on-stage and the crowd below busting out one last burst of CRAZED CHOREOGRAPHY -- ending the song just as we SMASH CUT TO A TITLE CARD OVER BLACK: FALL Silence. 
We take a moment to collect ourselves before -- 92 OMIT 93 EXT. / INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - LOS ANGELES - DAY CLOSE on Mia. 
She looks tired. 
A bit weathered. 
She's nursing a green tea across from Laura. 
They've finished eating. 
LAURA Look at him -- watch -- Mia glances out the window. 
A MAN in his early 40's has just parked, is walking around his car, inspecting it. 
LAURA (CONT'D) Now he's going to check the other window. 
Yep, it's closed. 
Now he's going to check again. 
Yep, still closed. 
Mia smiles. 
The MAN enters the restaurant -- greets Mia -- and kisses Laura. 
This is HARRY. Her new boyfriend. 
HARRY Hey. 
I'm grabbing some pastries, you two want anything? 
MIA Thanks Harry, I'm good. 
Revision 52. 
LAURA Same here but I think someone's trying to break into your car. 
Harry rolls his eyes, heads to the front. 
Laura looks at Mia. 
LAURA (CONT'D) Don't stress about the play. 
Where's Seb now? 
MIA I think today's San Diego. 
I'm not sure... 
A moment passes. 
LAURA You should come over tonight. 
Harry's cooking, but don't let that stop you. (Mia manages a smile; a beat) What's the matter? 
MIA Nothing... 
LAURA You miss him. 
MIA I guess. 
I'm adapting. 
LAURA (nods; then,) I got used to being alone. 
Growing up it was just me and Seb. 
We only had each other. 
MIA He told me. 
LAURA I wasn't looking for anybody. 
Then I met Harry and -- we just fit... (Mia smiles) You've changed Seb. 
You know that? 
Laura means it positively -- but Mia seems concerned... 
MIA Do you think he's happy? 
LAURA Is he happy? 
MIA I mean with the band, the travel, all of it. 
Revision 53. 
Laura shrugs. 
LAURA Our dad never got to do what he wanted. 
We were always treading water, he took a job running a washer-dryer store. 
But every night at home he'd play his clarinet along to a Benny Goodman record. (a beat) So I look at Sebastian... 
Playing music, getting paid for it. 
I'm happy for him. 
She notices Harry through the window, returning. 
Her thoughts drift. 
LAURA (CONT'D) Dreams change. 
A beat. 
She looks back at Mia. 
Sees her worry. 
LAURA (CONT'D) Don't overthink it. 
He'll be home soon. 
Harry rejoins the table. 
Hands Laura a sponge cake. 
LAURA (CONT'D) I told you not to get me anything! HARRY Oh, right -- I'll eat it I guess. 
LAURA No -- I changed my mind. 
They laugh. 
Kiss. 
Tender. 
Loving. 
Mia watches... 94 INT. DINER - NIGHT Mia eats, her laptop next to her meal. 
She takes a bite, types. 
We see her screen -- an e-mail draft, glimpses of words: "one- woman show", "one night only", "7pm", "I would be thrilled..." She thinks. 
Picks up her phone. 
Dials Sebastian. 
Waits. 
No answer. 
MIA Hey it's me... 
Not sure where you are -- maybe Boston? 
Or Dallas? 
Anyway... 
I haven't heard from you in a while... 
I miss you... (a beat) Ok... 
Bye... 
She hangs up. 
Resumes typing. 
Revision 54. 95 INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT COMPLEX / APARTMENT - NIGHT Mia walks through the courtyard. 
Reaches the door. 
Then hears something... 
Music -- LOUD, FAST JAZZ... 
She enters -- has to jostle the door handle to do so -- -- and then freezes in place. 
Sebastian is sashaying around a fully-decked table, lighting candles as he moves. 
He looks up, sees her -- and grins. 
SEBASTIAN Surprise. 
She lights up. 
He lifts up silver serving trays, revealing what he's cooked. 
Roast chicken. 
Pasta. 
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) And... (he hurries to the kitchen -- and holds up a big apple pie) There's twenty-five pounds of apples in it. 
It probably destroyed an ecosystem but it tastes good. 
Mia laughs. 
Can't believe it. 
Sebastian looks at her -- sincere now. 
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) I have to head back in the morning but I needed to see you. 
Mia's eyes seem almost on the brink of tears. 
Beyond moved, she runs into Sebastian's arms. 
A LONG, HEARTFELT KISS... 96 INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - EVENING CLOSE ON: The record player. 
An old jazz track. 
We see Mia and Sebastian seated at the table -- eating, drinking, laughing. 
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Feels so good to be home. 
MIA Stay. 
He smiles. 
SEBASTIAN How's the play going? 
MIA I'm nervous. 
Revision 55. 
SEBASTIAN Why? 
MIA Because... (a beat) What if people show up? 
SEBASTIAN Fuck `em! Laughter. 
Then -- SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) You're nervous about what they think? 
MIA I'm nervous to be up on a stage and perform in front of people. 
I'm terrified. 
SEBASTIAN They should be so lucky to see it. (then,) It's going to be incredible. 
I can't wait. 
MIA I can. 
A smile. 
Beat. 
MIA (CONT'D) What time do you leave in the morning? 
SEBASTIAN 6:45. 
MIA Ugh. 
SEBASTIAN Yep. 
Boise. 
MIA Boise? 
SEBASTIAN (nods) You should come. 
MIA To Boise? 
Revision 56. 
SEBASTIAN Yeah, you could knock that off your bucket list. 
Mia laughs. 
MIA Wish I could. 
A beat. 
SEBASTIAN Why can't you? 
MIA Come to Boise? 
SEBASTIAN Yeah. 
MIA Because I have to rehearse. 
SEBASTIAN Can't you rehearse anywhere? 
She looks at him. 
MIA You mean anywhere you are? 
SEBASTIAN ...I -- I guess... 
MIA Well, all my stuff is here and my show's in a few weeks and -- I don't know, it doesn't seem practical... 
SEBASTIAN Right... 
I just -- we're going to have to do things so we can see each other. 
We never see each other. 
MIA I know, but when are you done? 
SEBASTIAN ...What do you mean? 
MIA When are you done with the tour? 
Revision 57. 
SEBASTIAN But -- as soon as we're done with the tour we go back and record, and then we go back on tour. 
Mia looks at him. 
Doesn't seem to understand. 
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) We tour so we can make the record, and then we go back on tour to sell the record. 
Beat. 
Mia takes this in. 
MIA So it's...the long haul? 
SEBASTIAN ...What does that mean? 
MIA I mean the long haul -- like, you're going to be in this band for a long time. 
SEBASTIAN What did you think I was going to do? 
MIA I don't know, I didn't think the band would -- SEBASTIAN You didn't think we'd be successful. 
MIA No, that's not what I meant. 
What I meant was -- this band -- you're going to be on the road for -- what, years now? 
SEBASTIAN Yeah, feasibly -- I could be on the road for years with just this record. 
Beat. 
MIA Do you like the music you're playing? 
SEBASTIAN I don't know how that matters. 
MIA It matters if you're going to give up your dream to be on the road for years. 
Revision 58. 
SEBASTIAN Do you like the music I'm playing? 
MIA Yes. 
I do. (beat) I just didn't think you did. 
SEBASTIAN Yeah, well, I -- MIA And now I hear you're going to be on the road for years, and I'm -- SEBASTIAN What are you doing? 
Why are you doing this? 
MIA What do you mean why am I doing this? 
SEBASTIAN This is what you wanted from me. 
MIA To be in this band? 
SEBASTIAN To have a steady job. 
MIA Yes, I wanted you to have a job so you could take care of yourself and start your club. 
SEBASTIAN So I'm doing that. 
So why aren't we celebrating? 
MIA Why aren't you starting your club? 
SEBASTIAN You said yourself no one wants to go to that club! No one wants to go to a club called Chicken on a Stick -- MIA Change the name! SEBASTIAN -- and no one likes jazz. 
Not even you. 
Revision 59. 
MIA I do like jazz now, because of you. 
SEBASTIAN (not listening to her) What am I supposed to do? 
Go back to playing "Jingle Bells" so I can save money for some Shangri-La club no one wants to go to? 
MIA People will want to go to it! People love what other people are passionate about. 
SEBASTIAN Not in my experience. 
A beat. 
Mia realizes she's getting nowhere. 
A moment of quiet. 
Then -- SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Anyway -- it's time to grow up. 
You know? 
This is what I'm doing. 
If you had a problem, I wish you would've said something earlier, before I signed on the dotted line. 
MIA (trying again) You had a dream that you were sticking to, that -- SEBASTIAN This is the dream! MIA This is not your dream. 
SEBASTIAN Guys like me go their whole lives and never do anything that's liked. 
I'm finally doing something that people enjoy. 
What is wrong with that? 
MIA Why do you care so much about being liked -- ? 
SEBASTIAN (finally bursting--) You're an actress, who are you to talk?? 
Silence. 
We suddenly realize -- Revision 60. -- the LP has finished. 
You can hear the needle scratch against it now -- back and forth, back and forth. 
Sebastian looks at Mia. 
A moment. 
Finally -- SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Maybe you liked me more when I was a failure because it made you feel better about yourself. 
Mia looks back at him. 
Can't believe he said that. 
Tears starting to well in her eyes. 
She tries to suppress them. 
MIA Are you kidding? 
SEBASTIAN No. They stare at each other. 
Then -- all of a sudden -- the FIRE ALARM blares. 
Sebastian turns and sees smoke billowing from the KITCHEN. A dish in the oven has started to burn. 
Sebastian rises, springs toward the kitchen -- then sees Mia grabbing her things. 
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Wait -- But she's out the door. 
It slams shut, as Sebastian pulls the burnt apple pie from the oven. 
And on that -- WE SMASH CUT TO -- 97 OMIT 98 EXT. THEATER - DAY A poster, placed on the front of the theater we saw before. 
A title. 
A name below it: "MIA DOLAN." And a word: "TONIGHT." We spot Mia, carrying a box of props. 
She enters the theater. 
And we're -- 99 INT. THEATER - DAY The empty theater. 
Dark. 
Silent. 
Then -- a light turns on. 
Mia steps in. 
We stay WIDE. She seems small from this vantage point, surrounded by her props and backdrops. 
She takes a moment. 
Looks at all the empty seats. 
Revision 61. 
Takes a deep breath. 
Nervous. 
And then, nodding to herself -- you can do this -- she starts setting up... 100 INT. PRACTICE SPACE - DAY A BLAST of music. 
The Messengers have just finished a rehearsal. 
Sebastian packs his stuff, heads toward the exit, nodding to the others -- SEBASTIAN COLE See you tomorrow. 
See ya. -- when -- KEITH You good for tonight, right? 
Sebastian stops. 
Looks at Keith. 
SEBASTIAN ...Tonight? 
KEITH Seven. 
The photo shoot. (reading Sebastian's face, adding --) Mojo. 
A beat. 
Sebastian is confused. 
SEBASTIAN I thought that was next Thursday. 
KEITH No. It's tonight. 
We linger on Sebastian for a moment... 
KEITH (CONT'D) Is that ok? 101 EXT. REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY Sebastian stands out front. 
Checks his watch. 
Thinks... 102 OMIT 103 INT. THEATER / INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT People are shuffling into the theater. 
We DRIFT BACKSTAGE. Mia, now in a male suit and tie, watches behind a curtain. 
Checks her phone. 7:04. 
Breathes in. 
Nervous, and alone... 
She turns. 
Nods to the OWNER, off to the side. 
He heads to a switch, and the lights GO DOWN. Revision 62. 
You can hear the murmurs beyond the curtain. 
The audience, expecting. 
Mia tries to get her nerves under control. 
She can do this... 
Sets her phone aside -- one last breath -- -- and walks out. 104 OMIT 105 OMIT 106 INT. PHOTO STUDIO - NIGHT LOUD MUSIC. It's the band's song, blaring from a speaker. 
They're pantomiming -- the musicians styled and ready for their close-ups. 
A PHOTOGRAPHER grabs shots. 
PHOTOGRAPHER Put a light on the drums... 
I need more fill in this corner... 
We ZERO IN on Sebastian. 
His hair sticks out at various angles. 
An artfully-undone tie hangs from his neck. 
He fake-plays, as Keith pretends to lay in sampled beats... 
Keith, Tom, Malcolm, Cole -- they all grin, as excited as kids. 
Sebastian looks at them -- then down at his elaborate outfit, then back up at the Photographer running around, then at his watch... 
PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D) Bass, head up. 
Piano, look down at the keys. 
Sebastian does as told, but his thoughts are elsewhere. 
The Photographer moves in close, SNAPPING shots of just him -- PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D) Cut the music. 
Turn the keyboard live. 
Piano look up, play. 
The track stops. 
Sebastian stops as well. 
The CLICKS of the Photographer's camera loud now. 
PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D) No -- piano -- actually play something. 
Sebastian is still. 
Then he starts to play a single melody on the keys. 
We recognize it. 
The first notes of his and Mia's song... 
Revision 63. 
PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D) Good, now bite your lip like you're concentrating on a solo. 
Beat. 
Sebastian stops. 
Silence. 
He stares ahead. 
PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D) That was good. 
Don't stop. 
We PUSH IN on Sebastian... 107 INT. THEATER - NIGHT We're CLOSE on Mia. 
In ordinary clothes now. 
Behind her is a wallpapered wall, and a small window. 
By her side are the globe we saw in her room, and other little trinkets: a pearl necklace, an old suitcase, a roll of maps. 
Outside the window, projection of a starlit Parisian night sky. 
Completely silent, Mia moves to a lamp, turns it off. 
We go BLACK. Then -- the house lights go on. 
White, fluorescent. 
Thin applause can be heard. 
Mia manages a smile, as we finally see -- -- that the theater is less than a quarter full. 
Mia takes a bow. 
Peers out. 
One seat, in the front row, has a "RESERVED" sign on it. 
The seat is empty. 108 OMIT 109 INT. THEATER - DRESSING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER Mia slips inside, holding in her hurt. 
Starts collecting a few outfits -- then overhears two AUDIENCE MEMBERS outside -- AUDIENCE MEMBER #1 (O.S.) I swear to God, if I have to hear one more hipster waxing nostalgic I'm gonna slit my wrists. 
AUDIENCE MEMBER #2 (O.S.) Seriously. 
AUDIENCE MEMBER #1 (O.S.) She's not even good. 
That window thing...? 
AUDIENCE MEMBER #2 (O.S.) Christ... 
Don't quit your day job... 
Revision 64. 
Laughter. 
Mia freezes. 
The nail in the coffin. 
The voices fade. 
She slides into a chair. 110 EXT. THEATER - NIGHT Sebastian SPEEDING. Screeching to a stop. 
He's at Mia's THEATER. He dashes out and runs to the door. 
But it's locked. 
No one's in sight. 
Fuck. 
He spins around, frantic -- when Mia appears from an adjacent doorway, alone and carrying her box of props to her car. 
SEBASTIAN Mia! She turns. 
Sees him. 
He runs to her. 
WRAPS his arms around -- SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) I'm sorry -- -- and KISSES her. 
The kind of kiss that might once have swept her off her feet. 
He starts to move with her... ...starts to DANCE -- but -- MIA Stop -- She pulls away. 
Steps back. 
Sebastian looks at her. 
Unmoored. 
SEBASTIAN I'm -- I'm sorry I missed it -- and I'm sorry I was a dick and I -- I promise I'll make it up to you -- MIA It's over. 
She doesn't say the words with any anger. 
Just acceptance. 
SEBASTIAN (a beat; then --) ...What do you mean? 
MIA I'm done embarrassing myself. 
SEBASTIAN You didn't embarrass yourself... 
Revision 65. 
MIA No one showed up. 
I can't even pay back the theater. 
She says this as though just realizing it. 
Sebastian looks at her. 
A moment passes. 
He doesn't know what to say now. 
MIA (CONT'D) I'm gonna go home for a while. 
SEBASTIAN ...This is home. 
MIA Not anymore. 
Sebastian is silent now. 
A tear in his eye. 
He clenches his jaw. 
Mia looks at him one more time, steps into her car, and drives off. 
Sebastian lingers. 
Doesn't move. 
Silence. 
Then, music. 
Soft, melancholy, just piano, as... 111 OMIT A111 OMIT ...WE DISSOLVE TO: 112 OMIT 113 EXT. MIA'S CAR - DAY Mia drives, boxes stacked in the back. 
A113 She gets on the 405... 
Heading out of the city... 114 EXT. / INT. MIA'S HOUSE - NEVADA - DUSK Mia steps inside a modest house. 
Her MOM is by the door. 
Hugs her. 
Her DAD stands by the hallway. 115 INT. MIA'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DUSK Mia enters her old bedroom. 
Slides in a suitcase. 
Moves a couple of boxes from the hall. 
Looks around. 
Old photos. 
Old soccer trophies. 
She sits down on the bed. 
Takes a breath. 
And, finally, we're... 116 EXT. ORANGE GROVE - DAY Laura and Harry's ENGAGEMENT PARTY. We're outside, in a sun- dappled grove. 
A small gathering. 
Revision 66. 
Sebastian plays a baby grand piano -- the source, we realize, of the music we've been hearing... 
As he watches Laura dance with her new fiancé -- this woman he has known for so many years as a romantic cynic, now once again full of all the youthful innocence of first love -- his thoughts seem to drift. 
The music comes to a close and... 117 LATER: Sebastian with Laura, by the orange trees... 
LAURA You remember the McKenzies? 
SEBASTIAN Oh God, I didn't see them. 
LAURA Yeah. 
They kept going, "oh Sebastian's so handsome". 
Sebastian smiles. 
Then -- SEBASTIAN You look beautiful. (beat) I hope it was ok. 
I haven't played in a while. 
LAURA You were great (pause) You're always great when you play. 
Sebastian is silent. 
Then -- LAURA (CONT'D) Now -- listen to me. 
I want you to save for a down payment. 
You understand? 
You need a home. 
SEBASTIAN Yes ma'am. 
LAURA I'm not gonna be hovering anymore. 
SEBASTIAN ...You still think New York? 
LAURA I think so. 
Maybe Boston. 
I don't know, it's exciting... 
Sebastian smiles again. 
Some calls from the distance -- Revision 67. 
LAURA (CONT'D) Ah I gotta -- the future in-laws... 
She lights up. 
Likes the sound of that. 
LAURA (CONT'D) Is my...my hair...? 
Sebastian, without a word, pulls a strand back. 
Laura smiles, kisses him on the cheek. 
A quiet, tender moment. 
Then she hurries off. 
Sebastian stands there. 
Watches... 
WE FADE OUT. 118 INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - MORNING RINGING. Sebastian is awoken. 
Groaning, he rolls over. 
Lets the phone ring. 
It keeps going. 
Endless... 
Finally, fed up, he reaches for it. 
Answers -- SEBASTIAN What...? 
WOMAN #2 (O.S.) Hi, I'm trying to reach Mia Dolan. 
Sebastian is taken aback. 
He goes to hang up, saying just -- SEBASTIAN Wrong number. 
WOMAN #2 (O.S.) -- She's not answering her cell and I was told I might find her here. 
Sebastian pauses. 
Hurt by the mere mention of Mia's name -- SEBASTIAN Yeah, well...not anymore. 
WOMAN #2 (O.S.) Ok. If you do talk to her -- SEBASTIAN I won't. 
WOMAN #2 (O.S.) -- please tell her Jane at Amy Brandt Casting is trying to reach her. 
A beat. 
Sebastian sits up. 
Suddenly wide-eyed. 
SEBASTIAN "Casting"...? 
Revision 68. 119 INT. MIA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT Dinner has just finished. 
Mia's Mom gives her a kiss -- MIA'S MOM MIA Night, sweetie. 
Night, Mom. -- and heads off, as Mia and her Dad stay behind. 
Getting up to scrape the dish -- MIA'S DAD You want some more rice? 
MIA I'm ok. 
MIA'S DAD You look hungry. 
MIA I'm good... 
A moment. 
Mia's Dad puts a few more dishes away, then sits back down across from her. 
MIA'S DAD It's fun having you back. 
Your mom ditches me at ten. 
Mia laughs. 
A moment. 
MIA You took down the swing. 
MIA'S DAD She made me. 
A smile. 
MIA'S DAD (CONT'D) I've still got all your old tapes. 
MIA Oh God. 
Throw those away. 
MIA'S DAD Never. 
Just then -- a loud, persistent HONK. Mia's Dad looks up, eyebrow raised. 
Mia turns, hearing it as well. 
The HONKING is nearby -- just outside... 
Mia's thoughts suddenly sharpen. 
Ears perk up. 
She's heard the honking before: Revision 69. 
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHT. MIA'S DAD (CONT'D) What the hell...? 
Disbelief on Mia's face. 
It can't be. 
She heads to the nearest window. 
There -- at the corner, smack-dab in front of her house -- is SEBASTIAN'S CAR. A NEIGHBOR angrily yells at him. 
Sebastian sees Mia. 
They lock eyes. 
And on that -- 120 EXT. MIA'S HOME / SEBASTIAN'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER Mia and Sebastian stand next to his car. 
MIA Why did you come here? 
SEBASTIAN Because I have good news. 
MIA Ok... 
SEBASTIAN Amy Brandt. 
The casting director. 
MIA I know who she is. 
SEBASTIAN She was at your play. 
And she loved it. 
And she loved it so much that she wants you to come audition for a huge movie she's got. 
He's brimming over with excitement. 
But Mia just shakes her head. 
MIA I'm not going. 
SEBASTIAN ...Excuse me? 
MIA I'm -- no... 
That will kill me. 
SEBASTIAN That's it? 
MIA Yes. 
Revision 70. 
SEBASTIAN So you're happy here? 
MIA I'm happier. 
SEBASTIAN Why won't you come? 
MIA I told you. 
SEBASTIAN I don't buy it. 
MIA (finally letting it out, fed up --) Because it's another audition! (a beat; then --) I've been to hundreds of auditions. 
Do you want to know what happens? 
Either they interrupt me because someone ordered a sandwich, or they cut me off after two seconds, or I'm crying and they start laughing, or I'm one of a hundred lookalikes in the waiting room who never has a chance, because -- (beat) -- because -- SEBASTIAN Because what? 
MIA Because I'm probably not good enough. 
SEBASTIAN Yes you are. 
MIA No. Maybe I'm not. 
A beat. 
MIA (CONT'D) Maybe I'm one of those people who's always wanted to do it but never had a chance. 
It's a pipe dream. 
Maybe it's like you said. 
Maybe I need to grow up. 
She hesitates. 
Continues -- Revision 71. 
MIA (CONT'D) I can go back to school. 
I can find something else that I'm supposed to do. 
I left school to give it a shot, and it didn't work out, and it took six years, and I don't want to do it anymore. 
Beat. 
But Sebastian isn't giving up. 
SEBASTIAN Why? 
MIA Why what? 
SEBASTIAN Why don't you want to do it anymore? 
Mia thinks about this one for a moment. 
MIA ...Because it hurts a little bit too much. 
Sebastian shakes his head. 
Nope. 
Won't accept this. 
SEBASTIAN I told them you'd be there at five-thirty tomorrow. 
I'll swing by here before I drive back at eight. 
Either you'll be outside or you won't. 
With that, he gets back into his car. 
Mia is silent. 
Then -- MIA How did you find me? 
Sebastian turns. 
Points. 
Matter-of-fact -- SEBASTIAN The house across from the library. 
He drives off. 
Mia looks up. 
There, sure enough, is the LIBRARY, crouched on the corner. 
The library that once helped set her on her path to acting. 
She looks at it. 
Thinks... 121 EXT. MIA'S STREET - NIGHT/DAY Wide on the street. 
All is quiet. 
Night becomes morning... 
Revision 72. 122 EXT. MIA'S HOME - DAY Sebastian's car pulls over. 
He sits there. 
Sips a coffee, a second coffee in the holder. 
The time: 8:02. 
A moment passes. 
He taps the wheel. 
Looks at the house. 
The front door remains closed. 
No Mia. 
He leans back. 
Seems worried. 
Closes his eyes, breathes out. 
We MOVE CLOSE on him. 
He breathes in and out again... 
He opens his eyes. 8:10. 
The door's still closed. 
Resigned, he starts his car up, BEGINS TO PULL AWAY, when -- -- BAM! A KNOCK on the opposite window. 
He jumps. 
It's Mia. 
She's just arrived at the car from the other side, two just-bought cups of coffee and a bag of pastries in her hands. 
A beat. 
Sebastian smiles. 
Then OPENS the door for her. 123 OMIT 124 EXT. PARAMOUNT STUDIO LOT - DAY A cloudy late afternoon. 
Mia and Sebastian slowly walk through the lot together. 
They pass the New York street, the murals and posters of classic Hollywood, the old Art Deco ornaments and the big soundstages and backdrops. 
Neither says a word... 125 INT. WAITING LOBBY - DAY Mia and Sebastian are seated. 
Waiting. 
The DOOR opens. 
An ACTRESS exits. 
A second later -- ASSISTANT #2 Mia? 
Mia gathers her nerves. 
Gets up. 
And steps in. 126 INT. AUDITION ROOM / INT. LOBBY - DAY In the room is AMY BRANDT -- mid-forties. 
Seated behind her is the director, FRANK. AMY BRANDT MIA Hi, Mia. 
Hi. AMY BRANDT I'm Amy, this is Frank. 
Glad we found you. 
Mia nods. 
Smiles. 
A moment. 
AMY BRANDT (CONT'D) The movie shoots in Paris. 
There's no script. 
Revision 73. 
FRANK We want to build the character with you. 
It's a process. 
Three-month rehearsal, four-month shoot. 
MIA ...Ok. AMY BRANDT So why don't you just tell us a story? 
MIA ...About...? 
AMY BRANDT About anything. 
Mia nods again. 
A moment. 
AMY BRANDT (CONT'D) Whenever you're ready. 
Mia thinks. 
She takes a breath -- then goes silent again. 
It seems she might be unsure what to do, might even be about to choke the audition. 
We fear she may botch this completely... 
A126 WE CUT TO THE LOBBY -- to Sebastian, hearing Mia's silence. 
On edge... 
Worried... 
B126 WE RETURN to the AUDITION ROOM... 
Brandt and Frank waiting... 
MIA My aunt lived in Paris for a bit... 
She used to tell me these stories, when I was growing up, about living abroad... (beat) I remember -- she told me she jumped into the Seine once... 
She pauses, and then continues -- in SONG. [TRACK: AUDITION] Yes, this audition is different than the rest, and the switch to song signals just that. 
Mia's nerves fade away -- all the accents and fakery of earlier auditions a distant memory. 
This is Mia undisguised -- pure and stark and beautiful... 
She uses the story of her aunt jumping into the river to paint a portrait of all the dreamers in the world -- all the people who are told they're nuts for pursuing their passion -- all the so-called "fools" who take the plunge. 
She sings about them and for them. 
This is why Mia does what she does -- why she simply has no choice... 
The song ends, and we linger on her for a moment. 
Then... 
Revision 74. ...WE DISSOLVE TO: 127 EXT. GRIFFITH PARK - DAY Mia and Sebastian sit on a bench, the Observatory perched behind them. 
The clouds have parted, and it's now a gorgeous Los Angeles afternoon, minutes before dusk. 
Sebastian looks at Mia. 
A moment passes. 
SEBASTIAN When do you find out? 
MIA They said the next couple of days... 
But I'm not expecting to find anything out. 
SEBASTIAN You're going to get it. 
MIA No, I'm not. 
SEBASTIAN You are. 
I know these things. 
A beat. 
MIA Where are we? 
Sebastian looks at her. 
SEBASTIAN Griffith Park. 
MIA I mean -- where are we? 
SEBASTIAN I know... (beat) I don't know. 
MIA What do we do? 
SEBASTIAN I don't think we can do anything. 
Because when you get this -- MIA If I get this -- Revision 75. 
SEBASTIAN When you get this -- you've got to give it everything you've got. 
Beat. 
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) It's your dream. 
MIA What are you going to do? 
SEBASTIAN I've got to follow my own plan. 
Stay here. 
Get my own thing going. 
You know... 
A moment. 
Mia nods. 
Sebastian looks at her again. 
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) You're going to be in Paris. 
Good jazz there. 
And you love jazz now. 
Mia smiles. 
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Right? 
MIA Right. 
Another moment. 
And then, finally -- SEBASTIAN I guess we're just going to have to wait and see. 
Mia's eyes well up, just slightly, as she hears this. 
She nods. 
MIA You know I'm always going to love you. 
SEBASTIAN I'm always going to love you too. 
Beat. 
Sebastian looks up at the Observatory. 
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Look at this view. 
MIA (playfully) I've seen better. 
Revision 76. 
SEBASTIAN Agreed. 
They laugh. 
Then, almost to herself -- MIA I've never been here during the day. 
Sebastian smiles. 
A moment. 
We CUT TO WIDE. Sebastian and Mia sit side by side. 
We linger here, our two characters framed by the white-and-green Observatory, the rest of L.A. stretching out beyond. 
And then, ever so slowly... ...we FADE TO: WINTER A palm tree, a cloudless sky. 
We PULL BACK -- to reveal it's all painted... 128 EXT. STUDIO LOT - DAY We're on a studio lot, looking at one of the old painted backdrops, of a palm tree and sky. 
A new title card: Five years later... 
We TILT down to the studio's entryway. 
A CAR enters. 
A WOMAN steps out. 
We don't see her face. 
We FOLLOW her from behind. 
She walks elegantly, poised. 
The wind picks up a strand of her hair. 
She makes her way down side-streets we've seen before, past Parisian-style façades. 
Then enters a COFFEE SHOP we recognize... 129 INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY The eyes inside all look the WOMAN's way. 
She reaches the counter -- and we finally SEE HER FACE: MIA Hi... 
Iced coffee, please. 
MIA looks different. 
Different haircut, different way of handling herself. 
The BARISTA hurries to get Mia's order. 
We recognize this as the shop where Mia used to work. 
A man who appears to be the NEW MANAGER gives Mia the coffee -- Revision 77. 
NEW MANAGER On us. 
MIA No, no, that's fine. 
Mia hands over a few dollar bills. 
Then drops another bill into the tip jar. 
The Barista smiles. 130 EXT. COFFEE SHOP - MOMENTS LATER Mia exits the coffee shop...and is met by a CREW MEMBER on a GOLF CART. She gets on the cart -- and is driven away... 
CUT TO: CLOSE ON hands on piano keys, fluttering across the ivories. 
We PULL BACK: it's SEBASTIAN. We're in... 131 INT. JAZZ CLUB - DAY ...a small jazz club. 
Simple, tasteful, cool. 
Stone arches in 1940's style. 
The seats close to the band, the piano in the center. 
The club has the same old-school character as the Lighthouse -- but it's not run-down. 
It's polished, inviting. 
The place is empty save for Sebastian and an EMPLOYEE. It's before-hours. 
Sebastian finishes playing. 
Feels out the lowest keys once more, then the highest. 
Then turns and -- SEBASTIAN Alright, I'm done. (gets up) Harris did a nice job with it. 
EMPLOYEE Took him long enough. 
Sebastian smiles. 
SEBASTIAN No one touches the instruments. 
Carson's coming an hour early to test levels. 
EMPLOYEE I got a check for you to sign. 
SEBASTIAN How'd we do last month? 
EMPLOYEE Not too bad. 
Revision 78. 
SEBASTIAN (as he signs the check) Not too bad is great. (taps the Employee on the shoulder) See you tonight. 
EMPLOYEE See you tonight. 132 EXT. CHATEAU MARMONT - DAY Mia pulls into the driveway. 133 INT. ROOM - CHATEAU MARMONT - DAY She steps inside. 
Flowers and cards. 
We glimpse cursive "CONGRATULATIONS" written on a few of them. 
A stack of scripts on a nearby table. 
Her name visible. 
She drops her things, spots someone, goes in to kiss him. 
A long, tender, loving embrace, as we pull back... ...and see that it's not Sebastian. 
It's a MAN we haven't seen before: DAVID, mid-thirties. 
He and Mia kiss again. 
And, running over and grabbing Mia's leg, is a TWO-YEAR-OLD GIRL... 134 INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - EVENING Sebastian steps in. 
The place is more habitable than his old digs. 
Fully furnished, warm and welcoming. 
He heads to the kitchen, pulls out some pork cutlets he's been thawing. 
We see, sitting on the counter, a Christmas card with a photo attached: Laura, Harry, and a FOUR-YEAR-OLD BOY, all gathered on a couch and smiling at the camera. 135 INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - LATER Sebastian eats his meal, in a new shirt and pants. 
Checks his watch. 136 EXT. JAZZ CLUB - DAY Sebastian pulls up outside the club. 
New car, same style. 
Gets out and passes by a movie poster as he walks. 
We can't see the title, but we can catch a glimpse of a face on it. 
It's MIA... 137 INT. JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT We're back in the club. 
Revision 79. 
It's bustling now -- the BARTENDERS setting up, DOORMEN coming in, MUSICIANS sound-checking. 
Sebastian enters, the musicians greet him -- DRUMMER King Seb! SEBASTIAN Hothouse Eddie -- miss me? 
DRUMMER Like the desert misses the rain. 
And then -- we see a SAXOPHONIST we recognize. 
One of the old Lighthouse players. 
SAXOPHONIST Seb -- Edgar's bringing his horn tonight. 
SEBASTIAN Yeah? 
Tell him to tune it, huh? 
SAXOPHONIST That's not Edgar. 
Laughs, pats on the back. 138 INT. ROOM - CHATEAU MARMONT - NIGHT Mia, in a new outfit, crosses the living area and grabs her purse and jacket. 
David is by the door, jacket on as well. 
Mia bends back around a sofa, where the GIRL we saw before is seated next to a nineteen-year-old baby-sitter, CHELSEA. MIA Bye, sweetie. 
You be nice to Chelsea. 
The Girl nods. 
Mia kisses her forehead. 
Heads to the door. 
CHELSEA Bye, Mrs. 
Dolan. 139 OMIT 140 INT. CAR - NIGHT David drives, Mia seated beside him. 
They're on the 101. 
Gridlock traffic up ahead. 
DAVID What if we miss this? 
What do we tell Natalie? 
Revision 80. 
MIA We can just see it back in New York... 
David nods. 
Looks at the time on the car. 8:06. 141 INT. CAR - LATER Mia and David are seated. 
Still not moving. 
Mia looks at the clock again: 8:27. 
MIA (CONT'D) Do you want to just skip it...? 
Turn off here and get dinner? 
David looks at her. 
Smiles. 
DAVID Alright... 142 EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT Mia and David walk down a street. 
A few open restaurants and bars, a few other closed storefronts. 
A lot of old, weathered buildings: 1930's stucco, Art Deco signs. 
Then -- David's ears perk up. 
He hears something. 
MUSIC... 
He looks around. 
Doesn't see the source. 
Heads to the end of the block, then sees, just up ahead, a few people entering a building. 
Seems to be where the music's coming from... 
Mia heads over, curious. 
The music grows louder -- sounds like a JAZZ COMBO. Mia peeks toward the door... ...and then FREEZES. The sign on the door reads: "SEB'S". It's written the way she drew it for Sebastian, years ago... 
Coming up to her side, oblivious -- DAVID (CONT'D) This looks fun. 
David edges past Mia. 
Glimpses the bar inside. 
Turns to her, inviting -- DAVID (CONT'D) Come on... 
Mia doesn't know what to say. 
She follows David... 
Revision 81. 143 INT. JAZZ CLUB - CONTINUOUS Inside, a JAZZ COMBO is tearing through a fast bop chart. 
The seats around the band are almost all occupied. 
Young fans, older couples, passersby trickling in from outside. 
It's an excited crowd, far more varied than what we saw at the Lighthouse -- a real range of ages and styles. 
Mia's eyes drift as David heads to the bar. 
She recognizes the images on the walls -- all Sebastian's. 
Recognizes a stool by the bar -- also Sebastian's, formerly Hoagy Carmichael's... 
DAVID (CONT'D) Mia? 
She turns to David. 
Wavering, unsure what to do, she follows him as he manages to find two empty seats close to the bandstand... 
The combo finishes. 
Hearty applause. 
A young PIANIST rises from the keys, waves "thanks". 
And -- just then -- Sebastian appears. 
Mia looks at him, frozen. 
SEBASTIAN (taking the microphone) Manny Halloran, ladies and gentlemen. (more applause) I don't know, I told him to play "Jingle Bells". 
The crowd laughs. 
Sebastian smiles, looks at them -- -- and sees Mia. 
Shock. 
The two LOCK EYES -- and you can tell it's the first time they've seen each other in years. 
A prolonged silence. 
Sebastian is speechless. 
Then -- forcing himself to keep on a face -- SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Welcome to Seb's. 
More applause. 
Sebastian sits at the piano. 
Looks at the keys. 
He seems uncertain -- perhaps unsure what to play. 
He looks at Mia. 
Takes the sight in. 
Beat. 
Then looks at his fellow musicians. 
Murmurs to them. 
Then turns back to the keys -- -- and finally starts playing. 
Revision 82. 
A quieter tune, just piano, soft and tender and melancholy. 
A melody we -- and Mia -- instantly recognize... 
It's Mia and Sebastian's song. 
Mia looks at Sebastian. 
He looks at her, then back at his keys. 
This is the most beautiful we've ever heard his playing. 
The most tender, and full of emotion, it has ever sounded. 
We MOVE CLOSER on Sebastian. 
We recognize this image. 
It recalls the visualization of his dream, back at the RESTAURANT that night in winter, years ago. 
Gradually, as Sebastian plays, his surroundings seem to grow DARKER. Slowly, subtly at first, with just shifts in lighting, then a shift in perspective, the interior of the club changes, and soon... 144 ...we find ourselves back at that same RESTAURANT... 
Back when Mia laid eyes on Sebastian for the first time... 
Within this fantasy-flashback, Sebastian finishes his piece. 
We stick on Mia, watching him as his Boss talks to him. 
All is as before, as we remember it... 
And sure enough, Mia approaches Sebastian as he walks near her, and -- MIA I just wanted to say -- I saw your playing, and I -- -- but instead of brushing past her -- -- Sebastian decks her with a kiss for the ages. 
A BURST OF ORCHESTRAL MUSIC. The DINERS in the restaurant spin around to face Mia and Sebastian -- and SNAP their fingers in time. 
Even the Boss starts to DANCE. Mia and Sebastian grin -- and then strut out together, hand in hand... [EPILOGUE] 145 INT. NEW APARTMENT - DAY Mia and Sebastian push open a new door -- to their new place. 
It's a shabby one-bedroom -- but it's theirs... 146 INT. LIGHTHOUSE CAFE - NIGHT Next, Keith approaches Sebastian at the Lighthouse -- but Sebastian immediately shakes his head "no". 147 INT. THEATER - NIGHT Sebastian watches Mia perform -- it's the night of her play. 
He stands up to applaud -- and behind him, the entire theater, utterly packed, rises as well. 
A huge standing ovation. 
Mia's ROOMMATES are there, giddy with joy, as are LAURA and HARRY... 
Revision 83. 148 INT. STUDIO SOUNDSTAGE - DAY / NIGHT Mia and Sebastian walk together outside -- but now that we're outside we realize this isn't the real L.A. at all.. 
This, in fact, is an L.A. that doesn't exist. 
A painted- backdrop L.A., just like the one we saw Mia pass by when parking on the lot... 
The old orange groves and the gabled rooftops and the moss- covered bungalows and the ivy-decked lamps, the jacaranda trees and the giant hills and Griffith and the Santa Monica Pier -- all painted, all props, all figments of a studio- backdrop imagination. 
We've entered a fully fantastical realm, the realm of the old Hollywood ballets of the 40's and 50's... 
A148 Everyone DANCES -- the pedestrians and the street performers and the cops and the guards... 
AMY BRANDT races up to Mia -- seems to beckon her to audition... 
We see the audition silhouetted against a wall... 
We don't hear Mia sing, but the music takes on the melody of her song, carrying us to... 
B148 PARIS... 
Sebastian travels there with Mia... 
We chart the journey through an OLD GLOBE -- the same one we saw Mia use for her play -- a miniature plane and dissolves, the old- Hollywood-movie way... 
Finally, we find ourselves looking at a PAINTED BACKDROP of Paris -- the same one Mia used for her play. 
The Sacré-Coeur and the Arc de Triomphe and the Eiffel Tower etched in bright colors, the ornate lampposts and the cobblestones stretching before us... 
And then a sign -- "CAVEAU DE LA HUCHETTE"... 
C148 We see a jam session at the Caveau -- a crypt-like jazz club. 
Sebastian plays, on cloud nine... 
C148pt We see a MOVIE SHOOT, Mia surrounded by lights and cranes, decked in movie-movie glow. 
We're BACK to the Caveau. 
The lights go out -- except for the TRUMPETER, playing out a lovelorn solo, rim-lit. 
We MOVE in close on his horn -- DIVE into the bell -- D148 -- and emerge into NIGHTTIME PARIS. All painted. 
Mia and Sebastian wander through this wonderland, pedestrians frozen around them... 
Finally, they stop and look at one another... 
And -- as the city lights behind them start to glitter like all the stars of the galaxy... ...they DANCE. Revision 84. 
This is the last time we'll ever see them dance, and they seem to recognize that, so graceful and poised are their movements... 
Remember -- this is a romance more perfect than a real romance could ever be... 
We DISSOLVE again -- to a projector beam... 16mm footage plays on a screen, full of scratches and pockets of light... 
Mia and Sebastian sit down to watch together -- and we see the following moments in brief, vivid GLIMPSES, as we move in closer on the imagery: 149 The first home... (16mm) 150 Mia's pregnancy... (16mm) 151 The newborn child... (16mm) 152 The child's first birthday... (16mm) 153 The child's first day of pre-school, all dressed up... (16mm) Everything here glows with the warmth of old home movies... 
These are memories, fluttering by, grabbed at random -- and yet all concocted, dreamed up out of nothing... 
The SCORE continuing to sway and taking us right up to... 154 Sebastian and Mia, husband and wife, father and mother, hiring a babysitter because they've decided to go out for a night at the movies... (We're back to 35mm now.) The look here is unaffected, just everyday. 
The MUSIC quiets slightly, everything goes more natural, as this happily married couple hit the road... 155 ...then find themselves blocked by a traffic jam...then take a side route, winding up in another part of L.A... 156 ...then walk down the street, then hear music -- a jazz combo playing somewhere... 157 ...and step into a place that looks just like Sebastian's club... 
They sit down to listen... 
And then -- and this is how our imagined montage-musical number ends -- the combo's PIANIST, who of course is not Sebastian, launches into Mia and Sebastian's melody... ...and Mia and Sebastian look at each other, recognizing it. 
The music goes full-circle, back to where it started, as Mia and Sebastian look into each other's eyes, lean in and, softly, but with all the love in the world... ...KISS. Revision 85. 158 WE CUT BACK TO THE PIANO: Sebastian has just finished his piece. 
We're back to reality. 
The audience in the club applauds. 
Beat. 
Mia looks at Sebastian. 
Looks away. 
A moment passes. 
DAVID Do you want to stay for another? 
She's silent for a second. 
Then she looks at David. 
MIA No... 
We should go. 
He nods. 
They rise from their seats and head for the exit. 
Just as they reach the door, and as David steps out, Mia turns and looks back at Sebastian. 
He looks at her. 
Their eyes lock. 
A hint of a tear in both... 
And, ever so subtly, for just a fleeting second, Mia smiles. 
It's the kind of smile you could miss if you blinked -- but it's enough to signal to Sebastian that she recognized the melody he played, and that she still remembers it, and still thinks of it to this day... 
Then she walks out the door. 
Sebastian glances at his fellow musicians. 
Then, he nods, and they launch into a new chart. 159 EXT. STREET - NIGHT It's silent outside. 
You can't hear the music. 
Mia and David reach their car. 
They get in. 
It pulls out. 
Passing by Sebastian's club, the car continues on. 
We stay put, the jazz club on one side of the frame, the lights of the car on the other. 
Those lights growing smaller and smaller, before finally disappearing into the big L.A. night... 
IRIS FADE OUT. 
THE END
THE REVENANT Written by Mark L Smith Based on the novel by MICHAEL PUNKE September 26, 2007 Revenge is an act of passion; vengeance of justice. - Samuel Johnson Based on a true story FADE IN: EXT. UPPER MISSOURI RIVER/1820'S - EVENING ANGLE ON A SINGLE COTTONWOOD LEAF... brown and crisp... clinging to its empty branch... the solitary sign of life on an otherwise barren tree. 
A gust of wind... the leaf breaks free... flutters down, landing in the slow current of the Missouri. 
The last leaf of the fall, taking its final journey south. 
As it floats along the surface, rising and falling with the current, all we can hear is the river's gentle movement... the trickle of water... the splash of timid rapids... until DISTANT VOICES invade this world... soft at first, but growing louder... 
LAUGHTER... 
SINGING. And then our leaf CRASHES INTO A WOODEN BOARD... the BOW OF A BOAT. We hear the VOICES EVEN CLEARER... 
MEN'S VOICES, as we rise up the bow... see it's a FLATBOAT BEACHED ON A SANDBAR at the center of the river. 
Beyond the flatboat are the voices... 
TWENTY MEN of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company, making camp along the shore... hauling wood, building campfires, pitching squares of canvas for makeshift rooftops. 
And this camp is full of life because these are some of the first men to ever see this untouched wilderness... men with a whole new world just waiting for them to claim their share. 
EXT. CAMP - EVENING CAPTAIN ANDREW HENRY, (late 20's), dressed in a buckskin jacket with long fringe... thick belt pulled tightly around his waist with two pistols and a knife hanging from it. 
He stands out among the others... like an imposter pretending to be a member of some exclusive club. 
He pulls off one of his gloves... examines the BLOOD-FILLED BLISTERS lining his palm. 
From across the camp, JOHN FITZGERALD, (40's), solid and thick... dark eyes of a killer, watches Henry. 
He nudges MACE BOONE, (40's), a thief in a previous life. 
FITZGERALD Likely got a splinter. 
Can't figure what to do without Mama here to pull it out for him. 
Boone chuckles... spits in Henry's direction. 2. 
BOONE Need a doc, Captain? 
Henry looks up... sees Fitzgerald and Boone grinning at him. 
He slides his glove back on. 
HENRY Gather more wood. 
Fitzgerald waits for Henry to turn, then gives his back an exaggerated salute. 
FITZGERALD (under his breath) Shame my Pap was a broken down drunk. 
Else he could've bought me a Captain's job too. 
Boone snickers. 
Fitzgerald stomps his boot onto a branch, easily snaps it into two easy-to-carry pieces. 
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) We got a plan for these fires, Captain, or are we roastin' berries all the way up to Fort Union? 
HENRY Glass and the others will be back with some game, Fitzgerald. 
Just make sure you have the fires ready. 
FITZGERALD My supper's in the hands of a hermit nigger, a kid and a dummy. 
Hell, my belly feels full already. 
Fitzgerald's boot CRACKS another branch... and when it does, we hear the EXPLOSION OF A GUNSHOT. CUT TO: EXT. WILDERNESS - EVENING And a CLOUD OF SMOKE surrounding the LONG BARREL OF AN ANSTADT RIFLE. The smoke fades, and at the other end of the rifle we see the face of HUGH GLASS, (40's), African-American, one eye still closed, as the other calmly stares down that barrel. 
VOICE (O.S.) Shit fire, you got him, Mr. Glass! 3. 
Glass lowers the rifle, as PIG GILMORE, (30's), fat and filthy, races past. 
PIG (CONT'D) Square as a barn door. 
JIM BRIDGER, (17), young eyes that have already seen a lot, nods to Glass as he follows Pig. 
Glass watches Pig and Bridger trot through the trees to a fallen ELK. Glass walks calmly after them, graceful in this world... his rifle so comfortable in his hand it's like he was born with it there. 
Pig crouches over the dead elk... grins up at Glass. 
PIG (CONT'D) Right where you said he'd be. 
BRIDGER But bigger than we figured. 
Gonna be a load to haul back to camp. 
PIG Have to split it up I reckon. 
GLASS Yep. 
Bridger'll take the tail, and Pig you haul the rest. 
And Fitzgerald was right about Pig being a little slow, because he just nods... pulls out his knife to cut the tail off for Bridger. 
Bridger and Glass exchange a smile... until Glass notices something... steps over the elk, his eyes locked on the ground beside it. 
He runs a finger over the dirt... touches a broken twig. 
BRIDGER Another one close by? 
Glass doesn't answer... studies the track... feels the nearby brush... inhales the scent from his hand. 
Bridger and Pig watch him... exchange a confused glance. 
And then in a flash of movement, Glass is on his feet, racing away. 
PIG Hugh? 
Glass just keeps running. 
Pig and Bridger chase after him. 
CUT TO: 4. 
EXT. CAMP - EVENING The men building fires... laughing... enjoying themselves. 
Boone on the outskirts, gathering branches. 
CUT TO: GLASS - TEARING THROUGH THE WOODS... ...dodging trees... leaping over fallen logs... loading his Anstadt as he runs. 
BRIDGER AND PIG - CHASING AFTER GLASS... ...but not as gracefully. 
Pig trips... slams to the ground... scrambles back to his feet to continue on. 
CUT TO: BOONE - CARRYING AN ARMLOAD OF WOOD INTO CAMP... ...seeing other men playing cards. 
He stops along the edge of camp, drops the wood to the ground. 
BOONE No rule says I'm the only one that's gotta gather this shit. 
The other men don't even notice. 
Then an ARROW WHIZZES THROUGH THE AIR from behind Boone... 
THWACK... it hits him in the back of the neck... erupts out the front of his throat. 
Boone stands frozen... confused... reaches up and grabs the bloody arrow... finally drops to his knees. 
And that's when a TRAPPER looks up... sees Boone on his knees, holding that arrow, his mouth open like a dying fish. 
AND BEYOND BOONE ARE FORTY ARIKARA WARRIORS CHARGING THROUGH THE TREES... 
FEATHERS RISING FROM THE MOHAWKS SPLITTING THEIR SHAVED HEADS... 
FACES PAINTED FOR BATTLE. TRAPPER `REE! WHOOSH... 
AN ARROW SAILS INTO THE TRAPPER'S CHEST, sending him flying backward. 
The camp explodes into chaos... men YELLING... grabbing for weapons... stumbling over each other as they duck behind trees. 5. 
HENRY - PULLING THE PISTOLS FROM HIS BELT... ...taking aim at the attacking figures. 
The Arikara pour into camp, arrows flying... knives and hatchets swinging. 
And this is a massacre... the Arikara wading through the trappers... stabbing... clubbing... scalping. 
This once peaceful world is filled with a sickening mix of war cries and screams of death. 
Fitzgerald rises up from behind a log... aims his rifle... 
BOOM... takes down one of the warriors. 
He starts reloading as ANOTHER WARRIOR charges him... draws back his knife. 
Fitzgerald pours the powder, but knows he isn't going to make it in time... the warrior leaps toward him... ...BOOM... it's like the warrior hits an invisible wall... flies back to the ground, very dead. 
Fitzgerald spins... sees Glass and his Anstadt right behind him. 
GLASS GET TO THE BOAT! Fitzgerald takes off... flips his rifle around, swings it like a club across a warrior's head... 
WHACK! GLASS (CONT'D) (TO HENRY) THE BOAT, CAPTAIN! Henry shoves a TRAPPER toward the water. 
An arrow drives into the trapper's leg... he goes down. 
Henry lifts the man to pull him into the river, but several more arrows bury in the man's back... he falls limp. 
Henry FIRES HIS PISTOLS, dropping the WARRIOR. Bridger and Pig join Glass... splash into the river, SHOOTING back at the attacking Arikara. 
The water deepens, and they start swimming toward the flatboat. 
ARROWS HISS into the water all around them. 
Glass is still in the shallows... aims his pistol... 
BAM... shoots an oncoming warrior... spins after the other men... joins them as they near the flatboat. 
A final TRAPPER charges down the shore behind them. 
SEVERAL WARRIORS pursue him. 
TRAPPER WAIT! 6. 
He aims his pistol over his shoulder as he runs... pulls the trigger... 
CLICK... pulls it again... 
CLICK. But he's too scared to stop his finger... 
CLICK... 
CLICK... 
CLICK... 
THUD... as a hatchet buries in his back. 
He crashes face first into the shallows. 
The Arikara leader, (ELK'S TONGUE), animal bones braided into his mohawk, a NECKLACE OF HUMAN EARS around his neck, straddles the dying man. 
Elk's Tongue grabs the Trapper by the hair, and CUTS OFF HIS LEFT EAR, then holds it up to Glass and the others, as he SCREAMS HIS WAR CRY. Glass and the men shove the flatboat off the sandbar... start scrambling aboard, as arrows dart past them... drive into the wooden boat. 
Suddenly a WARRIOR EXPLODES FROM THE WATER... tackles Bridger as he climbs up the side of the flatboat... jerks him back into the river. 
Bridger flails in the water... watches the warrior raise his hatchet high to slam down... just as Glass SLAMS THE BUTT OF HIS ANSTADT into the back of the Warrior's head. 
The Warrior collapses under the surface. 
Glass grabs Bridger's hand... drags him up onto the deck. 
BRIDGER Thank you. 
But Glass is already gone... 
FIRING BACK AT THE ARIKARA, as the current carries them away. 
VOICE (O.S.) HEY! Pig looks over the side... sees a frantic WILLIAM ANDERSON gripped to the edge. 
Pig pulls him onto the boat. 
Fitzgerald and Glass grab LONGPOLES... shove them against the river's bottom to pick up speed. 
Henry stands on deck, watching as Elk's Tongue yanks a DYING TRAPPER's head back by his hair to peel away his scalp. 
Henry drops his eyes... can't watch. 
The TRAPPER'S SCREAM ECHOES OVER HIM. EXT. MISSOURI RIVER/FLATBOAT - LATER Quiet and dark... the battle long over. 
The flatboat floats with the gentle current. 
The NINE SURVIVING TRAPPERS are scattered around the deck... 7. 
Glass digging an arrow out of WALLACE MURPHY'S SHOULDER... 
Fitzgerald poling on one side with Anderson on the other... 
STUBBY BILL VANCE and Pig standing patrol with their rifles... 
Bridger doctoring a badly WOUNDED TRAPPER... and Henry standing at the front of the flatboat, staring off blankly. 
FITZGERALD What's the plan, Captain? 
Henry's still lost in those screams. 
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) Captain! What the hell do we do now? 
Henry snaps out of his stare... turns to the men... obviously doesn't have an answer. 
ANDERSON We're just floatin' farther from Fort Union. 
Henry's eyes instinctively look to Glass. 
GLASS The Missouri's no good. 
Not if the `Ree's running it. 
FITZGERALD So we just float the hell down to Mexico or wherever else this river takes us? 
GLASS We get ourselves safe outta range, then track another course up. 
FITZGERALD Add weeks to the trip. 
BRIDGER Better that than endin' up scalped on the side of the river. 
FITZGERALD (shoving him away) Shut up, kid, you don't get no say in this. 
Bridger starts to respond, but Fitzgerald's angry glare stops him. 8. 
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) (back to Henry) And in case you hadn't noticed, Captain, we're twelve men short of what we were. (off the badly wounded TRAPPER) Thirteen before long. 
HENRY I understand our situation, Mr. Fitzgerald. 
We do like Glass said... put some distance between us and the Arikara, then chart a course to Fort Union. 
Fitzgerald MUMBLES UNDER HIS BREATH... rolls those dark eyes to Anderson. 
Glass gives Henry a nod. 
EXT. MISSOURI RIVER/FLATBOAT - NIGHT ANGLE ON THE BADLY WOUNDED TRAPPER... 
NOW DEAD... ...as hands push the body over the side of the boat. 
It splashes into the water... floats downstream. 
We PULL BACK... see that the flatboat is beached along the bank of the river. 
Glass and Pig watch the body drift away. 
PIG Reckon it's better `an lettin' the `Ree find him... take his ears... slice what's left all to shit. 
Glass nods... steps down off the boat to Henry and the others. 
They're gathered around a map spread out on the ground. 
Henry runs his finger along a THIN BLUE LINE. HENRY So we hike west to the Grand, then follow it up to Fort Union. 
FITZGERALD On foot? 
You got any idea how long that's gonna take? 
It'll be winter before we get there. 
ANDERSON Unless we come across a post... trade for some horses. 9. 
GLASS No posts that far out. 
FITZGERALD So if we do this, we do every step with our own feet. 
HENRY We make camp here for the night, then load supplies and head out for the Grand at first light. (BEAT) And gather extra blankets `cause there won't be any fires. 
More GRUMBLING from Fitzgerald and Anderson, as they move toward the cover of trees. 
Bridger walks up beside Glass. 
BRIDGER Thank you... for what you done back there. 
GLASS You'd have done the same for me. 
Bridger nods... he hopes so. 
EXT. WOODS - NIGHT Pig on watch... sitting at the base of a tree, rifle across his lap, eyes wide, scanning the darkness. 
All clear. 
He peers back to camp... 
Fitzgerald, Anderson, Stubby Bill, and Murphy wrapped in blankets... passing a bottle of whiskey around. 
Bridger across from Fitzgerald, poking at the dirt with a stick. 
Henry is off to one side, still studying that map. 
Glass sits against a tree, cleaning his Anstadt rifle. 
Fitzgerald watches Glass a beat, then... 
FITZGERALD You treat that Anstadt sweeter than any woman, Glass. 
STUBBY BILL Never seen a woman that could stop a `Ree from three hundred feet. 
ANDERSON I knew a particular big-breasted redhead in Boston that might come close. 10. 
The others manage a small laugh. 
Glass just keeps working on that rifle. 
FITZGERALD Bring it over here for me to have a look. 
Glass doesn't look up... wipes a rag down the barrel. 
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) Did you hear what I said, boy? 
Still nothing from Glass. 
And Fitzgerald doesn't like that... the tension's growing. 
BRIDGER (MUMBLING) You seen it before. 
Fitzgerald turns that mean, drunken glare on Bridger. 
FITZGERALD What'd you say, kid? 
Bridger hesitates a beat... until the other men's eyes force a response. 
BRIDGER (SOFTLY) I said you shoulda already got a look when he saved you with it earlier. 
The camp falls still... nobody talks to Fitzgerald like that... especially when he's drunk. 
There isn't a sound except for Glass working methodically on his rifle... ...until the SWISH OF BLADE OVER LEATHER, as Fitzgerald tears the blade from his belt... flings it into the dirt between Bridger's legs... 
AN INCH BELOW HIS CROTCH. Fitzgerald stares at Bridger, daring him to react. 
But Bridger's too scared... doesn't, so Fitzgerald just smiles. 
FITZGERALD You're lucky you ain't a man yet. (off the blade) Else that mighta nicked somethin'. 
A few NERVOUS CHUCKLES from the others, hoping this is over. 
And it is, because Fitzgerald reaches over and pulls the knife away... cleans the dirty blade on Bridger's leg. 11. 
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) And unlike you, I don't need savin' by him or nobody else. 
Remember that. 
Fitzgerald stands... wobbles just a bit. 
He slides the knife back into his belt, then steadies his drunken gaze on Glass. 
The others exchange nervous glances... uh-oh. 
Fitzgerald walks to Glass... snaps his fingers for Glass' Anstadt. 
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) Lemme see what's so special `bout that shooter of yours. 
Nothing from Glass, so Fitzgerald grabs the barrel, but Glass holds firm. 
GLASS Middle of workin' on it. 
FITZGERALD Well you can stop workin' on it, and let me have a look like I said. 
Fitzgerald gives another tug, but Glass' grip only grows tighter. 
His eyes roll up to Fitzgerald... make it clear he isn't giving up his rifle. 
And they hold that stare just as hard as they're holding Glass' rifle. 
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) You forget your place? 
GLASS Best I can tell, my place is right where I want it... on the smart end of my rifle. 
Fitzgerald realizes the barrel he's holding is aimed right at his stomach, while Glass' hand seems suddenly very close to the trigger. 
But Fitzgerald's pride and that whiskey won't let him lose this tug of war. 
FITZGERALD I'd be careful if I was you, boy. 
And this thing's about to turn real ugly... until... 
HENRY That's enough, Fitzgerald. 
Go sober up and get to sleep. (MORE) 12. 
HENRY(CONT'D) If you're passed out when we break camp tomorrow, I leave you here. 
Fitzgerald holds his glare on Glass, then releases the rifle, shoving it back at Glass. 
He glances to Henry, and throws back a big gulp from the bottle just for spite, before backing away from Glass. 
FITZGERALD That's the trouble with this part of the world. 
No mirrors. 
Niggers forget what color they are. 
Glass ignores Fitzgerald... goes back to his rifle. 
Fitzgerald tosses the bottle at Anderson, then jerks his blanket up... walks off to sleep by himself. 
Glass glances up from his work... just long enough to give Bridger a nod. 
EXT. CAMP - LATER Fitzgerald sleeping off that whiskey. 
The others snoring in a cluster at the center of the camp. 
Henry lies there awake... looks across to Glass, still sitting against the tree, a HANDRAWN MAP in his lap, as his eyes pierce the darkness. 
Henry eases over to Glass. 
HENRY Can't sleep either? 
GLASS Never like closin' my eyes when I'm not sure who'll be standin' over me when I open `em. 
HENRY I keep thinking about Boone and the others... how maybe I should've had us make camp further up river. 
GLASS The tracks I saw... those `Ree had been tailin' us for a while. 
They'd have gone as far north as it took. (BEAT) You're a good man, Captain. 
Soon as you realize that, these others will too. 
Henry likes hearing that... still isn't sure it's true. 13. 
HENRY Your years trappin' and guidin' out here... have you had much experience with the Arikara? 
GLASS Enough to try and stay outta their way. 
HENRY (motions to Glass' map) But you know this country well enough to get us past them... up to Fort Union? 
GLASS I been here a long while. 
Whether that gets us to Union or not... 
Henry waits for more... doesn't get it. 
So he just nods and starts back to his blanket.... stops. 
HENRY What Fitzgerald said earlier... he doesn't speak for the rest. 
GLASS He wasn't wrong. 
Truth is that's what I prefer about this country... it's got no eye for the color of a man's skin. 
HENRY (BEAT) Try to get some sleep, Hugh. 
Henry climbs back under his blanket. 
Glass just sits there looking at the map. 
ANGLE ON GLASS' MAP... ...primitive at best. 
Sketched mountains... winding blue lines for rivers... small dots are scattered about with names beside them... "Brazeau", "Talbot", "Union". 
And DOZENS OF TRIANGLE PINE TREES have been drawn, representing the endless wilderness. 
We TIGHTEN ON THOSE TRIANGLES until we're lost in them. 
DISSOLVE TO: 14. 
EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY Thick with trees. 
Henry leads the men single file through the woods. 
They each have a canvas sack of supplies over one shoulder, and their rifle in their hands. 
The only sound is their feet crunching the dried leaves, and even that seems too loud as their eyes dart about, searching for any sign of attack. 
STUBBY BILL Shouldn't we have hit the Grand by now? 
HENRY We'll reach it soon enough. 
Glass said to keep this course. 
FITZGERALD Glass said. 
Too bad I don't see him. 
PIG That's on account he's up ahead makin' sure it's clear, and you get to keep your ears. 
Fitzgerald throws Pig an angry glance. 
FITZGERALD Or he's run off and left us. 
BRIDGER He wouldn't do that. 
Fitzgerald GRUNTS... doesn't believe that. 
FITZGERALD My bet, that nigger's used to runnin'. 
EXT. WOODS - DAY Glass moves slowly through the brush, almost gliding... subtle twists and turns to avoid branches and leaves... careful not to leave his scent behind. 
And his eyes cut through the trees as he moves... digging for any sign of movement. 
He spots something at his feet... crouches down, running his finger over the SMALL ANIMAL TRACK in the dirt. 15. 
O.S. 
RUSTLING snaps his head up... to the TREMBLING OF BUSHES... growing harder... whatever's in there is coming toward Glass. 
He calmly raises his rifle... presses the stock firmly against his shoulder... closes one eye as he takes steady aim down the long barrel... ...to the shapes rumbling out of the brush... 
TWO BEAR CUBS playfully wrestling. 
Glass lowers the Anstadt... looks past the cubs for something else... but the woods are empty. 
A SUDDEN FEAR FILLS GLASS' EYES... ...he spins... right into the GIANT GRIZZLY SWINGING ITS PAW AT HIM... hitting him across the side of the neck. 
The animal's razor claws tear into Glass' throat, as the force sends him flying through the air. 
Glass sails into a thick tree... the CRACK OF HIS LEG SNAPPING against the trunk. 
The rifle falls from his hand. 
The Grizzly lets out a massive ROAR... charges Glass. 
Glass crawls to the Anstadt... grabs it... has just enough time to tilt the rifle toward the bear... 
BOOM. CUT TO: HENRY - HEARING THE BLAST. HENRY UP AHEAD! Henry takes off at full sprint. 
The other men follow. 
CUT TO: GLASS - AS THE BEAR LEAPS ON TOP OF HIM... ...tosses Glass aside with a powerful swing. 
Glass hits the ground with a PAINFUL THUD. He starts CRAWLING AWAY, pulling the KNIFE from his belt as the bear rises up like a giant behind him... swings... tears its claws across Glass's back, shredding deep into his flesh. 
Glass is fighting for his life now... flailing with the knife... slicing it across the bear's paw as it whips past him. 
The wound slows the bear enough for Glass to start crawling again. 
But the Grizzly doesn't give Glass the chance... 
ROARS... is on him in a flash, a BLUR OF CLAWS AND FANGS... tearing across Glass' head... ripping into his face... his chest. 16. 
Glass drives his knife into the bear again... deep... trying to tear through the layers of flesh to something more vital. 
CUT TO: HENRY - LEADING THE CHARGE THROUGH THE FOREST. CUT TO: GLASS AND THE GRIZZLY - FIGHTING THIS EPIC BATTLE... ...locked in a death grip... tumbling along the ground... trading violent blows... 
Glass' blade versus the Grizzly's claws and fangs... snapping small trees as they roll over them... toward the edge of a steep embankment... ... and ROLL DOWN... spinning over and over... each ROARING AT THE OTHER... 
Glass pounding the knife into the bear again and again as they fall... neither willing to surrender as they careen down the slope at a dizzying pace, then SLAM TO THE BOTTOM WITH A CRUNCH. And the forest falls still... 
Glass hidden somewhere beneath the massive animal... both deathly motionless. 
EXT. WOODS - DAY Bridger's the first to reach the battleground... sees the TWO FRIGHTENED BEAR CUBS SCURRY AWAY. He follows the bloody ground and crushed underbrush to the top of the slope... looks down to the mass of flesh at the bottom. 
BRIDGER Christ Almighty. 
Henry, Pig, and the others reach the edge. 
HENRY Glass! No answer. 
And all they can see is the bear, so they scan the trees. 
PIG HUGH! Still nothing. 
So Bridger takes off down the slope... losing his balance but rolling back to his feet. 
He reaches the bear... sees GLASS' MANGLED ARM STICKING OUT FROM BENEATH IT. 17. 
BRIDGER He's down here! Bridger uses all his strength to push the bear off, as the other men scramble down. 
But Bridger can't budge the massive carcass... not until Stubby Bill and Pig join in... shove the animal over, revealing the bloody mass that is Hugh Glass... ...his throat is torn wide open... scalp peeled back from just above his eyebrows, hanging off the skull... stomach and chest a gruesome design of gashes and cuts. 
His right leg is snapped, the jagged bone jutting out through the skin. 
Bridger's legs give out... he drops to a knee and vomits. 
MURPHY Oh, Jesus. 
STUBBY BILL He's tore to pieces. 
The men stare down at Glass' corpse. 
ANDERSON Least he took that Grizz down with him. 
FITZGERALD Wished he'da done it without firing his rifle. 
If there wasn't no `Ree around before, there will be now. 
And that's all Pig can stand... he TACKLES FITZGERALD... they roll to the ground. 
And in a flash Fitzgerald is on top, raining punches down on Pig... turning his face into a bloody mess. 
Henry and Anderson grab Fitzgerald... drag him off. 
HENRY THAT'S ENOUGH! Then somehow, GLASS GASPS... this horrible, GUTTURAL MOAN. BRIDGER Holy Christ, he's alive. 
Henry and Bridger fall to their knees beside Glass. 
Glass looks up at the men, tries to focus through the blood and pain. 
His breathing is just a GURGLING WHEEZE... bubbles forming along the deep gashes in his throat with each gasp. 18. 
HENRY Get me some water. 
Stubby Bill tosses Henry his canteen. 
Henry empties it over Glass' throat... his face and scalp. 
The water hits the wounds and immediately transforms to blood. 
BRIDGER Oh, Jesus... 
Jesus. 
Glass lifts a trembling hand to his throat... feels the gaping wound. 
His eyes widen in horror. 
He COUGHS... the air splashes blood up from the open wounds in his throat. 
HENRY It's okay, Hugh. (pushing Glass' hand away) You're going to be fine. 
Henry spins his head away from Glass. 
HENRY (CONT'D) (WHISPERS) I need some rags before he bleeds out. 
Pig whips a shirt from his bag... shreds it. 
HENRY (CONT'D) And your whiskey. 
Pig tosses a bottle to Henry. 
Henry pours it over the gashes. 
The BURNING PAIN arches Glass... he CRIES OUT in that same horrific moan. 
HENRY (CONT'D) Hold him down, Bridger, goddammit. 
Bridger throws his weight against Glass' shoulders. 
HENRY (CONT'D) The rest of you spread out... scout a circle around us. 
Fitzgerald, you and Anderson take west and north. 
Murphy and Mike south and east. 
Watch for anyone that might've heard that shot. 
And for the first time, Henry seems like a leader of men... firm... in complete control... just as Glass said he would be. 
So the men hurry off to their positions. 19. 
PIG What about me, Cap? 
HENRY Get down here and help me tie off these wounds best we can. 
Pig shakily joins Henry in wrapping the wounds. 
The blood keeps seeping out, soaking the rags. 
PIG It won't stop bleedin'. 
HENRY Shut up, Pig. (TO GLASS) We're fixing you up, Hugh. 
Glass is like a shredded rag doll... dazed eyes staring up at them as they work on his wounds... wrapping the rags around his throat... laying his scalp back over his skull, and tying another rag around it and under his jaw to hold it in place. 
Bridger wipes the blood from Glass' face. 
BRIDGER It's gonna be fine, Mr. Glass. 
Henry glances down to the PUDDLE OF BLOOD spilling out over his knees... oozing out from beneath Glass. 
HENRY Roll him over... easy. 
They gently push Glass onto one side, revealing DEEP, JAGGED, GASHES running across the width of Glass' back. 
Henry stares at the open flesh, ready to panic again... but he doesn't. 
Instead he looks to Pig. 
HENRY (CONT'D) Get me the kit. 
We need to stitch his back up. 
BRIDGER What about the rest of him? 
HENRY He's losing more blood back here. (off the throat) And I don't know what to do with that yet. 20. 
Pig digs out a thick needle and spool of black thread... hands it to Henry. 
Henry grabs the whiskey bottle. 
HENRY (CONT'D) I'm sorry for how this is about to burn, Hugh. 
Henry pours the whiskey over Glass' back. 
And the pain must be excruciating, because Glass lets out a HORRIBLE WAIL. CUT TO: EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS Fitzgerald and Anderson standing watch together in the trees. 
Glass' scream erupts through the trees, and they both immediately crouch down to a knee... out of sight to anyone out there that might have heard that. 
ANDERSON They're torturin' the poor bastard. 
FITZGERALD And riskin' gettin' us killed in the process. 
Proper thing would be to end it for him quick. 
ANDERSON `Less he could pull through. 
FITZGERALD You seen what that grizz did to him. 
Shit, Glass'll be dead inside a hour. 
We all will be if he keeps screamin' like that. 
EXT. WOODS - LATER SERIES OF SHOTS HENRY, BRIDGER AND PIG WORKING OVER GLASS... 
Bridger and Pig pressing Glass' scalp down, as Henry slides the needle and thread through the skin, suturing the wound. 
HENRY CLEANING GLASS' SHREDDED THROAT. BRIDGER AND PIG HOLDING THE SCREAMING GLASS DOWN AS HENRY SNAPS GLASS' LEG BACK IN PLACE. 21. 
FITZGERALD PEERING BACK THROUGH THE TREES... to Henry doctoring Glass. 
Fitzgerald shakes his head in anger... turns back to the darkening forest. 
EXT. WOODS - EVENING Glass rests unconscious on the ground. 
Two branches act as a splint on his leg. 
A blanket covers his body... his face is like a swollen, disfigured, Frankenstein's monster... stitches of black thread holding it in place. 
Henry crouches a short distance away from him, rinsing his hands under a canteen. 
Bridger and Pig stand beside him. 
BRIDGER What now? 
HENRY We wait. 
Does he have any kin you know of? 
PIG He keeps to hisself. 
Never mentioned none. 
HENRY Go get the others. 
Tell `em we're making camp here for the night. 
Pig starts hustling away. 
HENRY (CONT'D) And gather some wood, but make sure it's dry. 
We don't want much smoke when we cook that grizzly. 
ANGLE ON THE MASSIVE BEAR... ...lying dead on the ground, its claws and fangs soaked with blood... 
Glass' blood. 
DISSOLVE TO: EXT. WOODS - NIGHT And what's left of the grizzly... its fur cut away... slabs of flesh butchered from its skeleton. 
A fire burns at the center of camp... a chunk of meat roasts above the flame. 
The men sit around the fire... 22. 
Murphy reaches up... tears a strip of meat from the roast, tossing it in his mouth. 
The men are silent... the pall of Glass' attack still hanging over them. 
Bridger rises... walks to the Grizzly... crouches down over it, grabbing the animal's enormous paw. 
It dwarfs his own hand, as he examines the claws. 
Bridger pulls out his knife... stretches the claw out to its full length, and CUTS IT OFF AT ITS BASE. FITZGERALD (O.S.) What makes you think you earned a claw? 
Bridger turns with a start... sees Fitzgerald standing over him, meat in his hand... his lips shiny with the grease. 
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) You didn't take that grizz down. 
BRIDGER It ain't for me. 
Bridger stands... walks over to the sleeping Glass. 
Pig's already crouched beside him. 
Bridger lifts Glass' small leather POSSIBLES BAG from beside the Anstadt rifle... drops the claw inside... throws a look back to Fitzgerald. 
Pig holds his palm out just above Glass' mouth. 
PIG I can feel some air outta his mouth. 
Maybe Captain sealed up his throat proper, huh? (off Bridger's silence) Whatta you figure his odds are, Jim? 
Bridger stares down at what's left of Glass. 
BRIDGER Long. 
EXT. WILDERNESS - MORNING The sun peeks over the horizon, sending an orange glow across the treetops. 
EXT. CAMP - MORNING ANGLE ON GLASS... 23. ...unconscious but alive... his raspy breaths are weak and staggered. 
The SHADOWS OF MEN hover over him... ...because Henry and the others surround Glass, staring down at him. 
MURPHY What that bear did to him... 
I didn't expect he'd last this long. 
ANDERSON I seen a fella go a week once after a lion jumped him. 
Fever finally finished him off. 
STUBBY BILL Whatta we do, Cap? 
A long beat, then... 
HENRY We give him his chance. 
Henry turns and walks away. 
EXT. CAMP - NIGHT The fire has burned down to nothing. 
The men sleep scattered about. 
Murphy stands just outside of camp, rifle ready, keeping watch. 
Glass lies there awake... eyes wide open... a living corpse. 
And his breathing is just as labored as before... raspy, blood-soaked strains. 
Fitzgerald tosses and turns, listening to Glass' gurgling. 
FITZGERALD You ain't doin' him or us no favors, Captain, lettin' him suffer that way. 
Henry's awake, but doesn't answer. 
He's holding his pistol in his hand, as he stares at Glass... thinking the same thing Fitzgerald just said. 
But he doesn't move... not yet. 
Fitzgerald angrily wraps a blanket around his head, muffling the sound. 
Bridger sits beyond him... smiles at Fitzgerald's misery, as he attaches the BEAR CLAW TO A THIN LEATHER STRAP... a necklace. 24. 
EXT. CAMP - MORNING Bridger kneels over a SHIVERING GLASS, holding wet rags on his head. 
Pig and Henry stand over them, watching. 
Fitzgerald, Anderson, Murphy and Stubby Bill sit huddled across camp. 
ANDERSON Fever's hit. 
Won't be long now. 
FITZGERALD I seen a bad one drag on days. 
ANGLE ON GLASS... ...eyes open... he can hear every word. 
FITZGERALD (O.S.) (cont'd) Insides shut down... flesh starts to spoil and turn. 
Ain't no way for... 
HENRY (O.S.) Quiet, Fitzgerald. 
FITZGERALD... ...points a stick at Glass. 
FITZGERALD (TO HENRY) We keep sittin' here watchin' him die, only gives the `Ree more chance to find us. 
Henry doesn't answer... just keeps staring down at Glass. 
BRIDGER He's burnin', Cap. 
Water turns to boil as soon as it touches him. 
Henry considers this, then... 
HENRY Pig, take Anderson and scout ahead. 
Grand should be just west of here. 
Find us the best route. 
FITZGERALD Tryin' to buy Glass time don't make sense for the rest of us, Captain. 25. 
HENRY (TO PIG) Get movin'. 
Pig nods... grabs his gear. 
He and Anderson take off out of camp. 
Henry turns... walks over to Fitzgerald and Stubby Bill. 
HENRY (CONT'D) (WHISPERS) You two can start digging a grave. 
Fitzgerald tosses the stick away. 
FITZGERALD Least it's a step in the right direction. 
EXT. CAMP - LATER Fitzgerald is covered in dirt and sweat, standing knee deep in Glass' grave. 
Stubby Bill stands over him. 
FITZGERALD Any coyote digs that deep deserves the meal. 
He takes Stubby Bill's hand... pulls himself out. 
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) Glass won't know the difference no ways. 
Pig and Anderson walk back into camp. 
PIG Found it, Cap. 
Right where Glass had us headed. 
ANDERSON No more than a mile or so out. 
Henry looks to Bridger, still doctoring Glass. 
HENRY We could build a litter. 
Haul him with us. 
ANDERSON It's rocky and steep goin'. 
Henry looks to Pig for an honest answer. 26. 
PIG Marshy and thick on the other side. 
We could try it, but... 
Pig shakes his head. 
FITZGERALD I signed on as a trapper, not a goddamn mule. 
BRIDGER (TO HENRY) Shape he's in... 
I don't see no way he'd make bein' drug. 
Henry nods, his mind racing for a solution. 
And before long, his hand is back on that pistol. 
He pulls it from his belt. 
The other men all drop their heads... except for Fitzgerald... he's ready to see this end. 
Henry stares down at Glass. 
HENRY Lay that rag over his eyes, Mr. Bridger. 
BRIDGER But, Captain. 
HENRY Do it. 
Bridger hesitates, then reaches to fold the wet rag down over Glass' wide open eyes. 
And Glass must know what's happening, because his eyes roll up to Bridger's... his lips try to form a word... his hand digs its fingers into the dirt beside him. 
CUT TO: GLASS' POV - ON BRIDGER... ...the boy looking away as he pulls the rag over our eyes... everything goes black. 
HENRY (O.S.) Step clear, Mr. Bridger. 
A LONG BEAT in the dark, waiting for that gunshot, then... 
BACK TO SCENE 27. 
Henry standing over Glass... pistol aimed down. 
His hand trembles slightly. 
Pig turns away... presses his hands over his ears. 
Bridger takes a few steps back... stares at Henry. 
Henry struggles to steady his aim, until finally it calms... because he's thought of something else. 
HENRY (CONT'D) There's a seventy dollar bonus from the Rocky Mountain Fur Company to the two men that stay with Glass... see this through. 
Then give him a proper burial. 
BRIDGER I'll stay with him... money or not. 
PIG Same here. 
HENRY I can't let you stay back, Pig. 
Without Glass, I'll need you to scout. 
Henry looks to the others... they all drop their eyes... not interested. 
HENRY (CONT'D) Just need one more. 
FITZGERALD Two won't stand much chance against a party of `Ree, Captain, and seventy dollars won't buy me a new setta ears. 
HENRY A hundred then. 
Still nothing from the others. 
BRIDGER They can have my share too. 
I owe Glass that at least. 
FITZGERALD That case I'll hang back with the kid. 
I don't mind fallin' a day or so behind for two hundred. 28. 
HENRY But Glass is to be cared for until. 
Understood? 
FITZGERALD (motions to Bridger) I'll let the young doctor do his job. 
Henry hesitates... doesn't like this, but knows it's the best option left. 
HENRY The rest gather your gear. 
Bridger reaches down... lifts the rag from Glass' face. 
Their eyes meet... 
Bridger gives Glass a nod. 
EXT. CAMP - LATER Henry and the others are loaded and ready to leave. 
Pig bends down over Glass. 
PIG I'll see ya at Fort Union, Hugh. 
Glass's glazed eyes focus on Pig. 
He moves the only thing he can... 
BLINKS a "yes" back at him. 
HENRY (to Fitzgerald and BRIDGER) As long as necessary. 
BRIDGER I'll look after him. 
Henry turns... leads the men into the trees... toward the Grand... toward Fort Union. 
EXT. CAMP - NIGHT What's left of a small fire is nothing but smoldering ash. 
Bridger crouches beside Glass, pouring a thin stream of broth between his lips. 
Fitzgerald reaches in... grabs Glass' Anstadt leaning against the tree. 
FITZGERALD I'll take first watch. 29. 
BRIDGER Not with his rifle. 
FITZGERALD Trust me, kid, he ain't gonna be needin' it tonight. 
Fitzgerald disappears into the trees. 
EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY Pig stands on a ridge, scouting a course. 
He waves back to Henry and the others. 
They start toward him. 
EXT. CAMP - EVENING Glass conscious on the ground... that same labored breathing. 
CUT TO: GLASS' POV - ON FITZGERALD... ...smiling down at Glass as he grabs the Anstadt, holds it... runs his hand down the barrel, as comfortable as if it were his own. 
FITZGERALD You were right to protect this. 
Then he disappears... and we're left alone, staring up at the branches above us... the evening sky... accompanied by Glass' deathly breaths. 
DISSOLVE TO: EXT. WILDERNESS/CREEK - DAY Bridger kneels beside the stream, filling canteens. 
EXT. CAMP - DAY Fitzgerald sits bored against a tree, twisting a knife in his hands... flipping it point first into the dirt... grabbing... repeating... twist... flip... thwack. 
And as he does, his eyes are locked on Glass. 30. 
Finally, Fitzgerald snaps the knife from the dirt, stands, and walks over to Glass. 
Glass is asleep. 
Fitzgerald crouches down over him... eyes his red, infected wounds. 
FITZGERALD (WHISPERS) When are you gonna die, boy? 
Fitzgerald reaches out with the blade... gently touches one of the threads holding Glass' throat together. 
And when he does, GLASS' EYES FLY OPEN... focus on Fitzgerald. 
Fitzgerald doesn't even flinch... just holds that knife tip there against Glass' throat. 
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) I'm nearly a week behind Henry's bunch on accounta havin' to tend to you. 
Be easier on us all if you'd take that last breath. 
The two men hold a stare... until Fitzgerald pulls back the knife... grabs a bloodstained rag from beside them... balls it up in his fist. 
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) I could help ya with that if you'd like. 
Muzzle ya right now... end all this sufferin' quick and easy. 
Nobody'd ever know you give up. 
Fitzgerald moves the rag over Glass' nose and mouth... holds it there, just inches above. 
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) You just gimme a blink if you want me to do it. 
Glass locks his eyes on Fitzgerald's... both men unblinking. 
A DROP OF BLOOD hangs from the rag... finally falls... lands on Glass' lips. 
Fitzgerald almost smiles, waiting for the inevitable... as Glass stares back, fighting the urge to blink. 
Suddenly Bridger's hand clamps down on Fitzgerald's shoulder. 
Fitzgerald spins... startled. 
BRIDGER (O.S.) What's goin' on? 31. 
Fitzgerald jumps with a start, sees it's Bridger, and is pissed that Bridger scared him... and interrupted his business. 
He rises quickly, planting his meaty hand in Bridger's chest, and SLAMMING HIM BACK AGAINST A TREE. FITZGERALD Don't you ever question me, you little piss-ant. 
Bridger tries to fight back, but Fitzgerald's too strong... holds him pressed against the tree... slams a heavy elbow into Bridger's mouth, splitting his lip. 
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) I'd just as soon leave both you and your nigger here to rot. `Cept killin' you ain't worth givin' up your share. (LEANS CLOSER) But that don't mean I can't be coaxed into changin' my mind. 
Fitzgerald shoves him away... 
Bridger stumbles and falls. 
Fitzgerald tosses the bloody rag at him. 
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) And I was just doin' your job... cleanin' him up. 
Fitzgerald grabs Glass' Anstadt, almost daring Bridger to say something. 
Of course Bridger doesn't. 
Fitzgerald walks toward the trees. 
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) Why don't ya pour some more broth down his throat... keep him alive another week so we can fall farther back. 
End up walkin' all the way to Fort Union on our own. `Ree would love to poach on just two. (turns to Bridger) I promise ya, you'll look a helluva lot worse than Glass when they're done with you. 
Bridger watches him disappear into the trees... wipes the blood from his lip with a trembling hand. 
DISSOLVE TO: 32. 
EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT From high above the trees. 
The world is silent... peaceful... until SEVERAL STARTLED CROWS shoot up from the treetops. 
CUT TO: BLACK... ...the sound of FRENZIED BREATHING. FITZGERALD (V.O.) (PANICKED WHISPER) Bridger! Get your ass up! Dim light fills the frame... then FITZGERALD'S FACE right in front of us. 
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) `Ree. 
BRIDGER - SCRAMBLES UP FROM UNDER HIS BLANKET, WIPING THE SLEEP FROM HIS FRIGHTENED EYES. BRIDGER What? 
FITZGERALD Keep quiet. 
I was down at the creek... there's twenty of `em at least, comin' this way. 
BRIDGER Oh, shit. 
Whatta we do? 
FITZGERALD We run. 
Now. 
And Fitzgerald's just whispering, but it's with such power that Bridger has no response... watches as Fitzgerald gathers his bag, starts throwing in food and supplies. 
Bridger is scared out of his mind... does the same... grabs for his rifle, resting near Glass. 
Bridger freezes... in his panic, he'd forgotten all about Glass. 
And now the wounded man's eyes stare up at him... understanding perfectly what's happening around him. 
BRIDGER What about Glass? 33. 
FITZGERALD He's on his own, same as us. 
BRIDGER I can't leave him. 
FITZGERALD Then I'm talkin' to a dead man. 
Glass gives Bridger the slightest of nods... go. 
But Bridger's frozen... doesn't know what to do... until Fitzgerald shoves him back to life. 
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) Move. 
Glass reaches out a weak hand out for his Anstadt... clawing for his weapon. 
Bridger starts to hand it to Glass, but Fitzgerald grabs it first. 
BRIDGER What're you doin'? 
He needs that. 
FITZGERALD He couldn't hold it if you tarred it to his hands. 
Glass strains to hold out his trembling hand for his gun. 
BRIDGER It's his goddamn rifle! That's all he's got! FITZGERALD And more than he'll need. 
Fitzgerald scoops up Glass' knife as well. 
BRIDGER We can't leave him with nothin'. 
But Fitzgerald is already sprinting away... disappearing into the trees. 
Glass stares after him, his once-calm eyes suddenly filled with a rage. 
And Bridger's frozen again, lost between duty and fear... until finally, he just shakes his head and takes off into the trees. 
Glass's empty hand falls back to the ground... he tries to yell out in anger, but his throat EXPLODES IN PAIN. His hand digs into the dirt... pulls him over onto his side. 
He flops over to his stomach... 
GASPS IN PAIN... 34. then using his one good arm, drags himself over the dirt, his healthy leg pushing weakly at the ground, trying to propel him forward... a futile chase after Fitzgerald and Bridger... ...inch by inch... farther than he's been in days. 
But it's still only a few yards, and now he lies in the open... a clear target for the Arikara. 
Then he spots that hole... the grave Fitzgerald dug for him. 
He grunts into action... grabs SEVERAL, THIN BROKEN BRANCHES from the ground, then claws forward, each movement excruciating... until finally, he reaches the hole, and ROLLS INTO IT... lands with a PAINFUL CRUNCH. He rests there a moment, trying to regain any ounce of strength. 
Finally he fights through the pain... shoves the branches back up... spreading them across the hole as camouflage... a thin veil, but all that Glass has. 
He lies there defenseless... 
INSIDE HIS OWN GRAVE. Hiding... listening for the Arikara's arrival... waiting to die. 
CUT TO: GLASS' POV - OUT OF THE GRAVE... 
TIGHT AND CLAUSTROPHOBIC... 
JUST THE NIGHT SKY THROUGH THOSE BRANCHES... 
AND THE SOUND OF HIS PAINFUL BREATHS. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. WILDERNESS - MORNING Cold and grey. 
Fitzgerald crouches beside a small fire, warming his hands. 
WHISPS OF SMOKE rise into the sky. 
FITZGERALD We ran the better part of six hours. 
Had to gain some ground on Henry and them others. 
Bridger sits at the base of a tree, not listening... staring... his mind replaying the desertion of Glass over and over. 
He notices the smoke. 
BRIDGER Best douse that smoke before them `Ree spot it. 
FITZGERALD We put enough distance between us and them. 
And it's too damn cold to go without one. 35. 
BRIDGER All we know, they hoofed it through the night same as us. 
FITZGERALD (shakes his head) A dozen `Ree can't make the time us two did. 
Bridger looks back to the trees... then considers something, stares at Fitzgerald a beat, before... 
BRIDGER It was twenty earlier. 
FITZGERALD What? 
BRIDGER When you woke me... you said you'd spotted twenty `Ree. 
FITZGERALD A dozen... twenty. 
I wasn't in a mood to count feathers. 
Hell, one `Ree woulda been too many. 
Fitzgerald empties his canteen over the fire, killing the flames. 
Bridger stares at the water pouring out. 
BRIDGER What was you even doin' down at the creak in the middle of the night? (BEAT) I'd already brought plenty a water. 
Fitzgerald doesn't answer. 
Bridger tightens his grip on his rifle... slowly rises. 
BRIDGER (CONT'D) Answer me. 
FITZGERALD Don't start questionin' me on accounta you feelin' guilty `bout leavin' your nigger buddy behind. 
Bridger musters up all the courage he can... aims his rifle at Fitzgerald. 
BRIDGER ANSWER ME OR I BLOW YOUR DAMN HEAD OFF! 36. 
Fitzgerald stares back at Bridger and his rifle... eyes taking in everything... a snake sizing up its prey. 
Then Fitzgerald stands... takes a step toward the boy. 
FITZGERALD What're you askin'? 
Why it was you turned your back on Glass? 
Why you let him die to save your own sorry skin? (BEAT) `Cause you was scared shitless, that's why. 
BRIDGER The `Ree... did you see `em? (off Fitzgerald's silence) DID YOU SEE `EM? FITZGERALD (MOVING CLOSER) Not a one. 
Bridger CRIES OUT... starts to pull the trigger, when Fitzgerald's hand flashes out, grabbing the barrel, and shoving the butt back into Bridger's face... 
THWACK. The force of the blow knocks Bridger back to the ground, but Fitzgerald holds his grip on the rifle barrel... flips it around to aim it at the boy. 
Blood drips down Bridger's head as he stares up at his rifle pointed down. 
Fitzgerald's finger tightens on the trigger. 
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) So that there is the answer to your question. 
And Fitzgerald PULLS THE TRIGGER... 
AND BRIDGER SQUEEZES HIS EYES SHUT IN FEAR... 
THEN CLICK. Bridger opens his eyes... sees Fitzgerald sneering down at him. 
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) And the next time you aim to kill somebody, kid, best remember your gun won't fire without a flint. 
Fitzgerald tosses the rifle back at Bridger, and turns away. 
Bridger's face flushes with rage and humiliation... he charges Fitzgerald from behind... tackles him to the ground... starts pounding Fitzgerald with punches. 
A few of them land, but it's only a moment before Fitzgerald is back in control... 
HEAD-BUTTING Bridger off of him... 37. tossing him away, then KICKING BRIDGER IN THE STOMACH... 
AGAIN. He grabs his knife... is ready to finish Bridger off... ...but Fitzgerald is smart enough to know that out here, two are safer than one... even when one is just a kid. 
He starts walking away. 
BRIDGER I'm goin' back for him. 
FITZGERALD Far as we ran all night, you couldn't find Glass with dogs and a map. 
And I don't believe you really want to. `Cause after leavin' him to die the first time, I doubt he'd be too happy to see you now. 
Fitzgerald digs at the dirt with the knife... covers the fire's remains. 
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) And just so we're clear. 
If you try to backtrack without me knowin', or ever get so guilty you feel the need to tell somebody. 
Fitzgerald looks at Bridger... hard... evil. 
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) I'll have no choice but to gut you from nuts to nose. 
Fitzgerald stares his point home, then shoves the blade into his belt, and stands. 
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) Now let's go. 
Bridger wipes the blood from his face, then throws one last glance behind him before following Fitzgerald. 
EXT. CAMP - MORNING Empty and quiet... no sign of life... until GLASS' HAND RISES BETWEEN THE BRANCHES. His fingers dig into the earth, pulling himself up from the hole... a dead man climbing out of his own grave. 
He rolls out to the ground... arches in pain when his back hits the cold, hard surface. 38. 
Glass lies there shivering, regaining what little strength he has, then rolls over... starts dragging himself again with that one good arm. 
He makes it to the blanket... wraps it around him. 
Glass rests there in the center of camp... unable to move... his eyes scanning the surroundings... no food... no water... and he's wide open in this clearing... an easy target for any predator. 
So he grabs his Possibles bag and GUNPOWDER HORN, and drags himself toward the cover of brush. 
And every movement takes all the will Glass has... a push with his good leg followed by a pull with his healthy arm... inch by inch... foot by foot... sweat pouring down his face as he finally reaches the cover of the trees... continues on... dragging himself across the forest floor in a desperate, hopeless crawl for survival. 
But finally it's too much for Glass... the fever and pain overwhelm him. 
He collapses... falls unconscious. 
EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY Glass lies in the dirt, weak... dehydrated... starving. 
He looks at his hands... scratched and bloody from clawing his weight. 
He unwraps his small, leather Possibles bag... dumps it to the ground, revealing it contents... flints, a straight razor, his map, and a LEATHER NECKLACE WITH THE SIX-INCH BEAR CLAW attached. 
Glass grabs the razor... cuts SEVERAL THIN STRIPS FROM THE BLANKET, and wraps them around his hands. 
He shoves the rest back in the bag, and does the only thing he can do... start crawling again... push with his healthy leg... pull with his good arm. 
EXT. WILDERNESS - LATER Glass dragging himself up a steep slope... over rocks... the jagged edges catching the wounds... tearing the primitive stitching. 
The gashes rip wider... blood oozes down, leaving a crimson trail dripping down the rock behind him. 
EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT The wind is howling through the trees. 
Glass lies beneath a cluster of brush... shivering... bleeding. 
Every aching breath creates a puff of smoke in the cold, night air. 39. 
EXT. MARSH - DAY Thick with a sea of four-foot high Cattails... like miniature cornstalks. 
Looking down from above the marsh we see a two- foot wide path of crushed plants that reaches the center of the marsh, and stops. 
We tighten on the end of the path, until we see Glass lying among the Cattails. 
He's sawing off one of the stalks with the straight razor... peeling away the husk, and eating the tender flesh beneath. 
Mosquitoes move in clouds around him... over his face... arms. 
But Glass' injured body only allows him one action at a time, so the mosquitoes have their fill of him, as he gnaws on the Cattail. 
EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY Glass pulling himself along the ground... stopping to tear a FEW BERRIES from a plant, and shove them in his mouth. 
He flinches as he swallows. 
He starts to move again, but freezes... listens... 
RUSHING WATER. Glass digs his fingers into the ground with new energy... pulls himself toward the sound... up over a ridge... and there it is at the bottom of the ridge... ...THE GRAND RIVER... 
WATER. Glass crawls down toward it. 
EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY Glass drags himself to the river's edge, cupping handfuls of water and rubbing it over his parched lips... withstanding the pain to gulp it down. 
As he does, Glass notices a FISH hovering in the shallows beside him. 
He makes a desperate grab for the fish, but it darts easily away. 
Glass cups more water to his mouth, but with each drink, he feels the water leak from a hole in his throat... run down his neck. 
He leans out over the surface to check his reflection... barely recognizes the swollen, stitched- together, disfigured face staring back at him. 
He fights off the urge to vomit... pulls the razor from the leather bag, and cuts more strips of blanket, soaking them in the river, then cleaning his wounds. 40. 
He runs a finger up to his shredded throat... around the open, wet hole. 
He cups another handful of water to his mouth... strains to swallow, then feels the liquid GURGLE OUT OF THE HOLE. Glass shoves the cloth against the wound... tries to press the flesh together... no good. 
He dumps out his Possibles bag... stares at the meager contents. 
He picks up one of the flints... looks to the powderhorn. 
EXT. GRAND RIVER - LATER ANGLE ON A SMALL CLUMP OF DRIED GRASS... ...as Glass SPARKS one of the flints... ignites the grass. 
As the fire grows, Glass pours a handful of GUNPOWDER from the horn, and RUBS IT ALL OVER THE HOLE IN HIS THROAT. He lifts several small blades of burning grass... a miniature torch. 
And only then do we realize what he's about to do... because he stares at the flame a beat, then raises it toward his gunpowder-covered throat. 
The flame nears the black powder, and LEAPS OFF THE GRASS, igniting the powder, and SETTING GLASS'S NECK ON FIRE. Glass falls back to the ground in agony... 
TRIES TO SCREAM, but his burning, shredded vocal chords won't allow him. 
The gunpowder sizzles and burns... the flame spreads... 
Glass' flesh sears... melts. 
And the pain is too much for Glass... he passes out. 
EXT. GRAND RIVER - NIGHT ANGLE ON GLASS... looking dead beside the river, but we know he's alive because we can hear those same painful, raspy breaths. 
And then we hear something else... an O.S. 
RATTLING, growing LOUDER... 
FASTER... 
BUZZING... until Glass' eyes flash open. 
CUT TO: GLASS' POV - ON A RATTLESNAKE COILED INCHES FROM HIS FACE. Glass stares back in horror... has time to throw up his arm in protection as the snake STRIKES... 
SINKS ITS FANGS INTO HIS FOREARM. 41. 
He shakes it free, but can't escape the snake's next strike... locking its jaws onto Glass' burned throat. 
Glass opens his mouth to scream. 
CUT TO: EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY And Glass' eyes flying open in the glaring sun, as he awakens from his nightmare... looks to his arm... no snake. 
His hand instinctively jumps to his melted throat. 
No bites. 
But that's when he hears it... we all do... that same RATTLING FROM HIS DREAM. Glass slowly turns his head toward the sound... ...and there's a RATTLESNAKE COILED just a few feet away. 
Only it isn't poised to attack Glass. 
It's facing the other way, its target a FIELD MOUSE, trapped against a rock. 
The snake attacks, sinking its fangs into the mouse. 
The field mouse tumbles over... quivers as the poison runs through its body, then dies. 
As Glass watches the snake begin to make a meal of the mouse, his hand grips a rock. 
He drags himself toward the occupied snake... raises the rock high, then SMASHES IT DOWN ON THE SNAKE'S HEAD. Glass immediately pulls the razor from his bag, and slices off the rattlesnake's head, the field mouse still lodged halfway inside. 
Glass then drags the razor down the length of the snake... digs his fingers under the fresh seam, then peels the outer layer down off the rattler. 
With the skin still hanging off the round tube of flesh, Glass BITES INTO THE SNAKE, tearing off a chunk of meat. 
He gobbles it down, slowing only to painfully swallow the food past his injured throat. 
EXT. GRAND RIVER - LATER ANGLE ON THE REMAINS OF THE SNAKE... ...the head, skin, and not much else. 
GLASS - at the water's edge, drinking... touching his charred, melted throat... no leaks. 
He opens his Possibles bag... pulls out the GRIZZLY CLAW NECKLACE... stares at it a beat, then slips it over his head. 42. 
He drags out the map... spreads it on the ground, then throws a glance around him... fingers the point on the blue line... a rough guess of his location. 
ANGLE ON THE MAP... ...Fort Union at the top... hundreds of miles north. 
Fort Brazeau south... but not nearly as far away. 
Glass gazes north up the Grand, as if he can see Fitzgerald and Bridger just ahead of him. 
Then he looks back down to his reflection in the water... battered and scarred. 
He looks to his leg... all but worthless for now... his one good arm. 
It's clear he's not ready to take revenge on anyone. 
So Glass shoves the map back into the bag... ties it around his arm with the powderhorn and blanket, then grabs a THICK, FALLEN LOG, and rolls it into the river. 
Glass crawls in behind it... deeper, until the current grows strong enough to carry the weight of his mangled body downstream. 
Glass drapes his healthy arm over the log, and starts floating... letting the river do the work. 
He watches the land move past him faster than it has in days... and without all the agony of every move. 
EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY Winding through the open prairie. 
Glass hangs onto the log... floats with the gentle current. 
EXT. GRAND RIVER - EVENING The sinking sun casts an orange glow over the water. 
Glass floats downstream... past a HERD OF ELK grazing along the riverbank. 
The animals don't even notice him. 
EXT. GRAND RIVER - NIGHT Dark... the moon hidden behind clouds. 
A heavy mist hangs over the river. 
Glass is draped across the log, eyes closed... letting the slow current carry him south. 
But then his eyes open... because he hears something... a LOW RUMBLE. Glass looks to the river banks... too foggy to see anything clearly. 
The RUMBLE GROWS LOUDER. He peers ahead... too dark to see much... just ANOTHER SPLINTERED LOG floating in front of him, its one jagged branch rising up in the air. 43. 
But then THE LOG VANISHES. Glass squints through the fog, scanning the surface. 
But it's gone... the water's empty... that LOW RUMBLE GROWS EVEN LOUDER. Glass looks to the water beside him... a BRANCH GLIDES PAST AT A HIGHER SPEED. And now Glass knows what's coming, but it's too late... because the world suddenly turns upside down, as Glass tumbles over the edge of a TWENTY FOOT WATERFALL. He spirals downward... crashes into the rushing current. 
He's washed forward with the suddenly violent rapids. 
They pull him under the surface, then toss him GASPING back out. 
The river carries him blindly through the mist... tossing... turning... 
SLAMMING HIM INTO A HUGE BOULDER... 
CRACK... he spins off, swept away headfirst... the foaming water sucking him down the rocky gauntlet. 
He tumbles over more boulders... his Possibles bag snaps loose... 
Glass makes a grab for it, but is suddenly flipped down another set of falls. 
The Possibles Bag is lost in the raging river. 
Glass sinks beneath the surface, then floats back up, as the rapids calm... spit Glass to the gentle shallows. 
His body drifts face-down toward shore. 
And just when we're sure Glass has to finally be dead, his arm reaches up from the water... he digs his fingers into the muddy bank, and drags himself out of the river. 
Glass collapses unconscious to the ground, his body shrouded in that mist. 
EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY TIGHT ON THE LEFT SIDE OF GLASS' FACE... the right still pressed into the muddy bank. 
The sun beats down... then SHADOWS APPEAR... 
BOUNCE ACROSS HIM... something is standing over Glass. 
And then a VULTURE'S HEAD DROPS INTO FRAME... ...latches its beak onto Glass' cheek... tugs at it... stretches it. 
Glass' eyes pop open... we PULL BACK to see THREE VULTURES surrounding Glass' body, pecking and clawing at his battered wounds. 44. 
Glass swings his good arm, knocking one of the vultures away. 
He tries to cry out, but only that PRIMITIVE HISS ERUPTS from his throat. 
The vultures dance away from his flailing... aren't willing to give up their meal so easily... dart in for quick attacks on his flesh. 
Glass grasps a branch... swings at the birds, beating them back. 
The vultures give up the battle... fly away. 
Glass crumbles back to the ground... squints up into the sun... the SILHOUETTES OF THE VULTURES CIRCLING ABOVE HIM... waiting for him to die. 
Glass looks down to his wounds, again oozing blood. 
He glances around... sees a ridge just a few hundred yards away. 
At the base of the ridge, a GIANT BOULDER has broken free, creating a partial cave. 
Glass starts crawling toward it. 
And if it's possible, he looks even closer to death now than when he started this journey. 
EXT. CAVE - DAY No more than ten feet deep, but enough to hide from predators. 
Glass drags himself as far back in the recess as he can... collapses against the rock wall. 
INT. CAVE - DAY Glass gathers loose sticks and grass into a small pile... begins sparking rocks together to build a fire. 
INT. CAVE - LATER The fire burns beside Glass, as he TEARS A SINGLE THREAD of cloth from the tattered blanket, then feeds it through a tiny hole in a JAGGED, NEEDLE-SIZED SLIVER OF SHARPENED ROCK... a man-made needle and thread. 
Glass goes to work on the open wounds of his chest... piercing his skin with the rock... wincing with pain as he tugs the thread through the fresh hole in his skin... pierces the other side of the wound, then pulls the flesh tightly together... before repeating the excruciating process all over again... pierce... pull... pierce... tighten. 45. 
EXT. GRAND RIVER - NIGHT The moon's glow reflects off the water. 
INT. CAVE - NIGHT ANGLE ON GLASS' HAND... ...holding a small sharp stone, and SCRATCHING LETTERS INTO THE CAVE'S ROCK WALL. WE PAN DOWN TO THE GROUND... still listening to the SCRATCHING OF THE ROCK as we glide across the dirt... reach the fire... its flame warm and strong. 
We TIGHTEN ON THE FIRE, until WE'RE INSIDE IT... and then WE PULL BACK... ...and we see the fire has long died away... just black ash. 
The O.S. 
SCRATCHING has silenced. 
We glide back across the cave floor... to Glass unconscious on the ground. 
And above him on the wall, we see what he had been scratching... "Robbed and left to die by Fitzgerald and Bridger. 
If find eether kill for Hugh Glass" We hold on those words a beat, then... 
DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY DROPS OF RAIN dot the surface. 
THUNDER RUMBLES... the rain grows heavier. 
EXT. CAVE - NIGHT Rain pouring... gullies of water run down the ridge, spewing over the mouth of the cave. 
But inside, Glass doesn't stir... lying there just as we last saw him. 
EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY Rain coming down in buckets. 
The river's raging. 
EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT Clouds drift across the moon... the storm has ended. 46. 
EXT. CAVE - DAY Sunny and clear. 
A rabbit hops along... stops for a moment outside the cave. 
Beyond it, Glass is still sprawled on the cave floor... he must be dead. 
The rabbit continues on past. 
INT. CAVE - DAY TIGHT ON GLASS' FACE... as his eyes flutter open. 
He stares straight ahead, unmoving. 
EXT. CAVE - DAY Glass crawls out of the crevice... shields his eyes from the sun, as he takes in the scene. 
The river has sunk back to normal, leaving the banks battered and muddy. 
The water is thick and brown with all the flooded earth it pulled up. 
Glass uses all his strength to rise up to his knees, then higher... onto his healthy leg. 
He braces himself against a tree. 
He's still crooked and hunched over, but for the first time since the Grizzly attack, he looks more like a man than an animal. 
He bends down... picks up a BROKEN TREE BRANCH. EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY Glass limps along the bank... beside the brown water stirred up from the flood. 
He moves along the washed-out area, searching for food... grabs some plants... tears them from the ground to chew on the roots. 
He continues on... spots a DEAD SNAPPING TURTLE drowned in the flood, frozen on its back. 
Glass kneels down to pick up the turtle... sniffs it. 
As he does, he spots something across the river... a DEER, staring back at him. 
Glass slowly raises his IMAGINARY RIFLE... takes careful aim at the deer... pulls the trigger. 
If only he had his Anstadt. 
But then the deer's head snaps... to something beyond Glass. 
Glass follows the animal's eyes... turns to the ridge... and the FIVE ARIKARA WARRIORS STANDING AT GLASS' CAVE. Glass drops flat to the ground behind a tree uprooted in the flood. 
He looks back across the river... 
THE DEER IS LONG GONE. 47. 
Glass inches his head up over the tree... to the warriors now crouched outside the cave... studying the tracks. 
Glass' eyes jump to the soft dirt along the river... 
HIS FOOTPRINTS CLEAR... an obvious trail leading right to him. 
He throws a glance around... nowhere to run even if he could. 
So he starts backing into the river on his stomach... feet- first... dragging a small branch over the tracks around him, wiping them away as he moves. 
And his eyes are locked on the Arikara... watching to see if they spot him. 
But they haven't yet, and Glass keeps sliding backward... five feet off shore... only three feet deep in the murky water and sludge. 
But if he goes any further, the current will catch him... pull him into the next set of violent rapids... and make him a clear target. 
The Arikara follow the tracks down from the cave. 
Glass sinks neck-deep into the water... the Arikara keep coming... near the river. 
So Glass drops beneath the surface. 
CUT TO: UNDERWATER - And Glass' eyes spread wide... searching the muddy water. 
He grabs a LARGE ROCK... rolls onto his back, and places the rock on his stomach, its weight holding him firmly to the river bottom. 
EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY ANGLE ON THE ARIKARA WARRIORS... following Glass' tracks to the edge of the river... looking out over the brown river. 
CUT TO: UNDERWATER - Glass pressing his head back against the bottom... staring up through the cloudy water... to the FIVE SHADOWS STANDING ONLY A FEW FEET AWAY. EXT. GRAND RIVER - CONTINUOUS The Arikara... unknowingly standing just above Glass... looking back to the tracks... scanning the water. 
But the surface is empty, and the river's too thick with mud to see anything below. 48. 
But they keep looking... and we're waiting for Glass to explode from the river, gasping for air. 
But he doesn't... and they keep scanning for what seems an eternity, until finally, the warriors turn... start walking back up the path. 
Behind them, Glass' face inches to the surface... pulls in some oxygen... watches as they fade into the trees. 
Then Glass rolls the rock away... starts moving deeper into the river... fighting the current to grab rocks and boulders... pulling himself to the other side. 
EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY Glass limps through the trees, still dripping with the muddy water of the Grand. 
EXT. WILDERNESS - LATER Glass is on his knees, desperately grabbing for a TINY FIELD MOUSE. The rodent escapes into a hole. 
Glass claws at the ground after it. 
He's starving to death. 
EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT The rain beating down through the trees. 
Glass huddles in a cluster of bushes, trying to stay dry... shivering in the cold. 
He reaches out from the cover, grabbing his moccasin boot standing in the rain. 
He pulls it in... slurps back the rainfall that it's caught. 
EXT. PRAIRIE - EVENING Glass limps slowly across the rolling prairie. 
He's weak... starving... isn't going to make it much further. 
He drops to his hands and knees. 
And then he feels something... the ground almost trembling under his hands. 
He watches his hands quiver with vibration. 
A RUMBLE BUILDS. Glass strains to hear... looks to the crest of a hill... labors up the gentle slope toward the sound. 
EXT. PRAIRIE/HILL - EVENING Glass reaches the crest... looks over the other side to a HERD OF BUFFALO THUNDERING ACROSS THE PRAIRIE. 49. 
An incredible site... hundreds of massive creatures... their hooves tearing up the earth, leaving a cloud of dust behind them. 
Behind the herd, a PACK OF WOLVES FIGHT OVER A FALLEN BUFFALO. Glass lies in the high grass, watching the wolves SNARL AND SNAP over the remains. 
And he eyes that buffalo... the closest he's been to food in days. 
EXT. PLAINS - NIGHT The five wolves rest around the downed buffalo, their snouts bloody from the meal. 
Suddenly, one of the wolves' heads snaps up... bares its teeth... 
SNARLS. And then we see what the wolf is growling at... 
Glass... limping out of the shadows toward the animals, holding a BURNING SAGE BUSH IN EACH HAND... like giant FLAMING HANDS clawing in the night. 
The wolves jump to their feet, unsure of what's approaching. 
They growl at Glass. 
But Glass keeps coming... doing his best to YELL... more like GROWL back at the wolves. 
He swings the flaming brush, tossing glowing sparks through the air. 
The wolves spread out, instinctively surrounding Glass. 
But Glass singles out each one... charges, waving the flames... driving each wolf back. 
Four of the wolves back away, but the leader holds its ground... even moves toward Glass... only a few feet away... 
SNARLING... bloody jaws ready to attack, but still not sure what its up against. 
Glass shakes the flames at the wolf... it SNAPS AT GLASS' ARM. Glass swings the other... slams the fiery plant across the wolf's head. 
The wolf YELPS... leaps back... starts to run away, but turns back... makes another charge at Glass. 
But Glass is ready... throws the flaming ball of sage at the wolf, then clubs it with the other. 
The animal's fur begins to burn. 
The frightened wolf has had enough... rolls on the ground, then spins to join the rest of its pack. 
They run a safe distance, then stop... keeping a watch on Glass. 50. 
Glass drags the burning sage bushes along the ground, igniting the grass and brush... creating a foot-high flaming wall between him and the wolves. 
He stretches the flame into a circle, a fiery ring surrounds the fallen buffalo. 
The wolves have seen enough... turn... race away from the flames. 
As the grass around him burns, Glass drops the sage plants... attacks the buffalo remains, tearing away bloody chunks of flesh from the carcass, and shoving them into his mouth... a starving animal that's finally found food. 
EXT. PRAIRIE - NIGHT From high above the prairie... 
Glass and the buffalo at the center of that glowing ring of fire. 
EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY The wind's gusting... bending the high golden grass over on its side. 
Glass moves slowly across, pulling his collar up to shield his face from the cold winds. 
He spots something in the distant sky ahead... a THIN LINE OF BLACK SMOKE. Glass picks up his pace... hope spurring him on. 
EXT. BURNED ARIKARA VILLAGE - DAY The charred, skeletal remains of a tribe's village... just black posts where tee-pees once stood... a half-burned log lodge still smokes, sending that black line into the sky. 
Glass limps through the graveyard of structures... all signs of life in this village long gone. 
He searches a basket... pulls out a BLANKET... wraps it around his shoulders. 
INT. LODGE - DAY Glass steps into the smoky warmth of the lodge... black and empty. 
He slides down to the floor... unwraps strips of roasted buffalo from what's left of his blanket. 
He starts to take a bite, when SOMETHING DARTS PAST THE DOORWAY TO THE BACK ROOM. The O.S. 
SHUFFLING OF FEET. Glass freezes... he isn't alone. 
He rises... grabs a splintered post like a spear... eases toward the doorway... raises the post to swing... 51. ...and sees the SMALL PUPPY standing in the back room. 
The dog takes off around a crumbled wall. 
Glass follows it. 
INT. LODGE/BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS Glass limps across the room... turns the corner of the crumbled wall... and sees the dog slide to a stop beside an ANCIENT ARIKARA SQUAW, huddled in the corner, her bony arms outstretched in front of her in weak defense. 
And her eyes are SOLID WHITE... the old woman is blind. 
She CRIES OUT A CHANT over and over... her death chant, as she waits for this stranger to kill her. 
Glass stands frozen... confused. 
He tries to speak, but his throat still won't let him. 
He crouches down in front of the old woman... reaches for her hand, but she flails him away. 
He grabs her again... gently... just holds it until she calms... studying the woman... her hollow face all skin and bones... she's obviously dying. 
He pulls the strip of buffalo meat from his pocket... pushes it into the squaw's hand. 
She immediately jerks it to her mouth... and that's when Glass sees the WOMAN HAS NO TEETH... she can't eat. 
Glass turns to an old pot tipped over on the floor. 
EXT. BURNED ARIKARA VILLAGE - DAY Glass carries the pot toward a nearby stream. 
The dog scurries out behind him... follows Glass to the water. 
INT. LODGE/BACK ROOM - DAY The pot boils over burning logs. 
Glass dips a cup in, pulling out a warm broth. 
He carries it to the squaw, still sitting in the corner... takes her hand, placing the cup in it for her. 
She gulps the liquid back. 
Glass goes back to refill the cup. 
The old woman MUMBLES SOMETHING we can't understand... over and over, as Glass brings the cup back to her. 
He tries to ease it into her hand, but the woman pushes it away... slides her hand up Glass' arm to his face... patting it... 
MUMBLING THOSE SAME WORDS... thanking Glass. 52. 
EXT. BURNED ARIKARA VILLAGE - EVENING Glass carries several blankets toward the lodge. 
The puppy trails behind him, biting at one of the corners... hanging on as Glass pulls him across the dirt. 
INT. LODGE - EVENING Glass enters the back room with the blankets... stops when he sees the old woman slumped over to the floor, her white eyes frozen open in a lifeless stare. 
EXT. BURNED ARIKARA VILLAGE - NIGHT Glass has stacked several burned posts into a crude pyre at the edge of the village. 
The squaw lies atop the pyre, covered in the blankets he gathered for her. 
Glass stands beside the pyre, a FLAMING TORCH in his hand. 
The puppy rests at his feet. 
EXT. DISTANT RIDGE - CONTINUOUS THREE INDIANS sit on horseback, watching Glass light the pyre... the flames rise into the night. 
EXT. BURNED ARIKARA VILLAGE - NIGHT Glass crouches... pets the dog, as he watches the flames spread... engulf the woman. 
ANGLE ON THE GLOWING EMBERS... ...floating into the night. 
Beyond the sparks, we see something else... 
THOSE THREE INDIANS GALLOPING TOWARD THE VILLAGE... 
FAST. And now Glass sees them too... knows it's too late to run, so he just stands there. 
But the dog's seen enough... darts away. 
Glass watches the Indians ride into the village... their braided hair and dress is different than the Arikara we've seen earlier, because these are SIOUX WARRIORS, and Glass knows it. 
The Sioux surround Glass on horseback... stare down at Glass. 
The lead warrior (SPOTTED HORSE), (30's), poised and strong, points to the flaming pyre... says something to Glass. 53. 
Glass tries to answer... can't... touches his scarred throat. 
Spotted Horse slides gracefully off his horse. 
The other two warriors, (THREE FEATHERS and RUNNING FOX) do the same... close in on Glass. 
Glass stands firm. 
Spotted Horse says something else to him. 
Again, Glass touches his throat... holds his jacket out from his sides... no weapons. 
Spotted Horse studies Glass hard... reaches out, wiping his finger down Glass' cheek, almost testing to see if the color comes off. 
One of the other warriors pats Glass' hair... smiles... says something to the others. 
Spotted Horse and the other warrior join him, each touching Glass' hair. 
Then Spotted Horse spots Glass' necklace... the grizzly claw hanging from it. 
He examines the enormous claw, then nods to Glass' stitching and scars. 
SPOTTED HORSE Griz-lee. 
Glass hears the familiar word... nods. 
Three Feathers pulls a WHITE SPECK from the back of Glass' neck... holds it up to Spotted Horse. 
Spotted Horse jerks out his knife. 
Glass is confused... holds up his hand, as he takes a step back. 
But Three Feathers and Running Fox grab Glass... secure him... pull his jacket down off his shoulders, exposing his shirt, as Spotted Horse walks around behind Glass... raises the knife... 
Glass GROWLS A PLEA... but Spotted Horse slices the knife down Glass' back... just cutting open his shirt... and revealing a MASS OF WHITE WORMS... 
MAGGOTS... 
COVERING THE DEEP GASHES ON GLASS' BACK. The three warriors exchange glances... they've obviously never seen anything like this. 
Glass sees their reaction... throws a nervous glance... what? 
Three Feathers runs his hand across Glass' back, dragging a HANDFUL OF WORMS for Glass to see. 
As Glass' eyes widen in panic, Spotted Horse SLAMS THE BUTT OF HIS KNIFE against Glass' head. 
Glass drops to his knees... makes a dazed grab for Spotted Horse... misses... and Spotted Horse HITS GLASS AGAIN. Glass tumbles unconscious to the dirt. 
Spotted Horse says something to the others... they grab Glass' limp arms... drag him toward the horses. 54. 
EXT. SIOUX VILLAGE - NIGHT Dozens of glowing campfires dot the prairie, along with a sea of tee-pees, their willow poles fanning against the night sky. 
Animal hides and painted designs decorate the various tee-pees and lodges. 
SIOUX CHILDREN laugh and play about the village... freeze when they hear Spotted Horse and the other riders splash across the stream. 
The warriors ride into the village, Glass' body tossed over the back of Three Feather's horse. 
The children race to them. 
ANGLE ON GLASS... regaining consciousness... eyes blinking... trying to focus. 
CUT TO: GLASS' POV - FROM THE BACK OF THE HORSE... ...to the children's eager faces swarming around him... studying this strange face. 
Spotted Horse - YELLING SOMETHING at the children... they back away from Glass... fall into line behind the riders. 
Sioux MEN and WOMEN watch as the procession moves past... to a tee-pee set away from the rest... its hide walls decorated with wild lightning bolts and buffalo and vaguely human figures circling the sun. 
An OLD MEDICINE MAN, gnarled and leathery, a DEAD RAVEN tied in his long hair, his naked chest painted with red and black stripes, steps out of the tee-pee. 
He eyes Glass, as Three Feathers and Running Fox carry him inside. 
Suddenly, the Medicine Man begins CHANTING. CUT TO: A FLURRY OF IMAGES ACCOMPANIED BY THE MEDICINE MAN'S V.O. 
CHANTING... 
LEATHER STRAPS SNAPPING AROUND GLASS' WRISTS AND ANKLES... stretched tight. 
Glass, naked, on his stomach at the center of the tee-pee, his arms and legs outstretched, secured to wooden stakes in the ground. 
The white worms cover his back. 55. 
The Medicine Man... 
CHANTING... waving burning sticks in the air. 
A THICK LIQUID BOILING IN A POT... the Medicine Man's twisted hand reaching a gourd container in... filling it with the steaming mixture. 
The liquid POURING OVER GLASS' BACK. GLASS' FACE... arched to the sky... twisted in horrible pain. 
He SCREAMS THAT HORRIBLE GROWLING CRY. MORE IMAGES... even faster... the CHANTING more frantic... 
A SIOUX WOMAN,(WAKI), staring down. 
HANDS wiping a GREEN SLUDGE over Glass' neck... chest. 
The Medicine Man dancing... chanting... shaking sticks lined with RATTLESNAKE TAILS. The moonlight shining through the tee-pee, illuminating the images of the buffalo and dancing shapes. 
Waki gently pouring fluid into Glass' mouth. 
The Medicine Man holding the SEVERED HEAD OF A SNAKE... lightly sinking the fangs around the wounds on Glass' throat. 
GLASS' EYES... wide open... rolling up white into his head. 
AND THE CHANTING STOPS... the world goes dark. 
EXT. YELLOWSTONE RIVER - DAY Cutting through the open prairie. 
Snow-covered peaks touch the sky in the distance. 
Fitzgerald and Bridger trudge their way across the prairie, dressed in furs. 
They rise up a steep slope... reach the top, and spot the cluster of log buildings inside a massive thirty-foot tall wooden fence. 
Fort Union. 
Bridger smiles... relieved. 
FITZGERALD `Bout goddamn time. 
They start down the slope. 
Fitzgerald grabs Bridger's arm... firmly. 56. 
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) And we're understood on everything... 
Glass' dyin' in his sleep... us buryin' him like was agreed. 
Bridger doesn't respond. 
Fitzgerald doesn't like that. 
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) You're as guilty as me in leavin' him. 
Don't you forget that. 
You got a future up here. 
No sense tossin' it away when he was as good as dead already. 
Shit, all we did was skip the funeral. 
Bridger pulls his arm free... continues on. 
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) I won't take to givin' up that two- hundred on accounta you gettin' weak-kneed. 
Bridger keeps walking. 
Fitzgerald follows behind. 
INT. FORT UNION - DAY Like a small town surrounded by a log wall. 
The main TRADING POST BUILDING is busy... 
TRAPPERS, SIOUX, all with things to trade. 
But most of the life is in the FORT UNION SALOON next door... crowded with customers downstairs, and just as busy in the whores' rooms upstairs. 
A small village of tents rests off to the side of the buildings, holding the overflow of traffic. 
INT. SALOON - DAY Fitzgerald and Bridger enter the crowded room... squeeze their way to the bar. 
FITZGERALD Twice the folks here than when we left. 
BRIDGER We should go see Captain Henry. 
FITZGERALD Far as we hiked... we got time for a drink on the company's tab. 57. 
PIG (O.S.) Jim! They spin... see Pig, Murphy and Stubby Bill sitting at a table. 
Pig scrambles up... rushes to Bridger, locking him in a big bear hug. 
PIG (CONT'D) You made it! I was scared the `Ree mighta caught up to ya. 
FITZGERALD If your fat ass could get through, we didn't have no worries. 
Pig glares at Fitzgerald... watches him walk to the table, joining the others. 
PIG (off Fitzgerald, to BRIDGER) Had to be a helluva long walk for you. 
Bridger nods... 
Pig has no idea. 
PIG (CONT'D) Hugh? 
Bridger hesitates a beat, then just shakes his head. 
PIG (CONT'D) Guess we all knowed how it would turn out. 
Did he suffer much more? 
Another long beat, then... 
BRIDGER I hope not. 
A PROSTITUTE walks down the stairs... stops on the landing, waiting for her next customer. 
Fitzgerald spots her... grins. 
FITZGERALD (TO BRIDGER) Maybe we best go see Henry, kid. 
I just got a itch to spend the first of my two-hundred. 
The other men laugh. 
Not Bridger. 58. 
INT. ROCKY MOUNTAIN FUR COMPANY OFFICE - DAY Henry sits at his desk. 
Fitzgerald and Bridger stand across from him. 
The others... 
Pig, Anderson, Murphy, and Stubby Bill crowd the room behind them. 
FITZGERALD I won't pretend to been his friend, but I respect any man that fights the way he done. 
HENRY And the grave? 
FITZGERALD We had those extra days so we went deeper... covered it in rocks. 
To keep the scavengers off him. 
HENRY Any sign of hostiles? 
FITZGERALD Not a one. 
The words are like a punch in the gut to Bridger. 
He can't take the pain... opens his mouth to speak, but Fitzgerald beats him to it. 
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) Truth is, I was worried `bout `Ree, and ready to get movin', but Bridger here argued to stay and make a cross for the grave. 
Bridger's head snaps to Fitzgerald... don't make this worse. 
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) So that's what we did. 
Pig reaches up... gives Bridger a pat on the back. 
But to Bridger, it feels like a red-hot blade. 
HENRY Glad to hear you pulled your weight, Mr. Bridger. 
I knew you would. 
FITZGERALD More than his share, Captain. 59. 
And now Fitzgerald has snared Bridger into his lie. 
Bridger drops his eyes to his feet. 
HENRY Speaking of shares. 
Henry turns to a SAFE resting against the wall. 
Fitzgerald watches as Henry spins the dial... locks in the combination, then pulls the latch. 
The safe door swings open... ...revealing STACKS OF CASH. Fitzgerald's eyes lock on all that money. 
Henry pulls out a handful... starts counting them out onto the desk. 
HENRY (CONT'D) Am I to assume the agreed arrangement didn't change? 
FITZGERALD Fortunate for me, it did not. 
HENRY Well thank you both for your courage and honor. 
You have done yourselves proud. 
Fitzgerald swipes up his pile of bills. 
Henry drops a couple bills in front of Bridger. 
HENRY (CONT'D) You're owed something for what you did. 
Bridger stares down at the bills a beat, then snatches them... pushes his way out of the office before he might have to look someone in the eye. 
FITZGERALD He's beat hisself up most of the trip... wishin' he'da done more. 
HENRY We all saw the shape Glass was in. 
There was no more to be done. 
FITZGERALD That's what I been tellin' him. 60. 
INT. BUNKHOUSE - DAY Empty, except for Bridger curled up on his cot, squeezing those crumpled bills in his hand, crying. 
DISSOLVE TO: INT. TEE-PEE - DAY Glass sleeps under a buffalo robe. 
His eyes flicker open. 
CUT TO: GLASS' POV - ON THE BUFFALO AND DANCING FIGURE DESIGNS SHADOWED THROUGH THE TEE-PEE. GLASS - His hand reaching up to his throat. 
It looks much better than we last saw. 
And the stitches are gone from his face, now just long, pink scars. 
He stiffly raises himself up... remembers his back... struggles to reach behind him... scarred but clean... no maggots. 
He looks beside him... sees BUCKSKIN PANTS AND SHIRT resting on the ground... waiting for him. 
EXT. TEE-PEE - DAY ANGLE ON GLASS... dressed... pushing his way out through the flap of the tee-pee... limping out into the midday sun, and shielding his eyes. 
He looks like a man that hasn't seen the light of day for weeks. 
Glass adjusts to the brightness... stares in wonder at the scene. 
And then we see what Glass is looking at, and understand his reaction... the entire village is blanketed in snow. 
The Sioux VILLAGERS move about, wearing heavy skins and furs. 
A WOMEN'S O.S. 
VOICE turns Glass... ...to WAKI, the woman from the images, walking toward him, bundled in fur. 
She says something else we can't understand... points to Glass' feet. 
Glass looks down... to his BARE FEET BURIED DEEP IN THE SNOW. He hadn't noticed. 
And then Waki smiles... a sweet, pretty smile. 
She takes his hand... leads him back into the tee-pee. 61. 
INT. TEE-PEE - CONTINUOUS Glass and Waki enter. 
She pulls a pair of moccasins from a basket... hands them to Glass. 
He slips them on, then presses his fingers against his throat... almost trying to hold it all inside to make it work, then... 
GLASS (scratching and rough) Thank you. 
Waki doesn't understand... just raises a cup of liquid... says something, then touches his throat... motions for him to drink. 
Glass sips the drink... grimaces... shakes his head, trying to give the cup back, but Waki refuses... points at his throat, and motions for him to drink. 
Glass stares in the cup a beat, then gulps it back... shakes his head. 
GLASS (CONT'D) Bad medicine. 
Waki smiles... hands him his BEAR CLAW NECKLACE. Glass nods in thanks, then achingly lifts his arms up to slip it over his head. 
GLASS (CONT'D) How long have I been here? 
Waki just stares back... no idea what Glass said. 
GLASS (CONT'D) You're Sioux. 
I only know a bit a Pawnee. 
Glass stumbles through a sentence of Pawnee. 
Waki shakes her head... throws a jumble of Sioux back at him. 
GLASS (CONT'D) The snow... my healin'. (points to himself) Me. (points to the ground) Here. 
How long? 
Waki shakes her head again. 
Glass leads her outside. 62. 
EXT. SIOUX VILLAGE - CONTINUOUS Glass points to the sun overhead, then raises both hands, fingers outstretched. 
GLASS How many suns? 
Ten? 
Waki studies Glass... the sun... begins to understand. 
She nods... 
SAYS A WORD... holds up all ten of her fingers. 
GLASS (CONT'D) Ten suns? 
Then Waki closes her hands into fists... opens them again... closes them again... 
SAYS A DIFFERENT WORD. GLASS (CONT'D) Christ. 
Glass glances around... for the first time, notices Sioux MEN and WOMEN staring at him. 
Children freeze in the middle of their play... all eyes locked on Glass. 
TWO SMALL BOYS, (NEW MOON and LITTLE ONE), repeat the same TWO WORDS to each other... 
BOYS Tatanka Wicasa. ...over and over. 
Glass stares back, unsure. 
Then... 
SPOTTED HORSE (O.S.) Buff-A-lo Man. 
Glass turns... sees Yellow Horse stepping out of a tee-pee. 
Spotted Horse (cont'd) (very broken english) What they call you. (points to Glass' hair) Fur of Buff-A-lo. 
Glass touches his hair... nods... smiles. 
The children smile and laugh now too... repeat the words LOUDER. GLASS You speak English. 
SPOTTED HORSE Need words when trade with whites. 63. 
GLASS Well I'm grateful for you bringing me here... havin' them care for me. (off Spotted Horse's nod) Now if you could point me which way it is you do your tradin'... with the whites. 
SPOTTED HORSE (POINTS) Whites. 
Bra-zo. 
GLASS Fort Brazeau? 
That's where I'm tryin' to get. 
Is it far from here? 
Spotted Horse doesn't understand. 
Glass motions into the distance. 
GLASS (CONT'D) Far? 
Long way? 
Spotted Horse points to a horse, then holds up three fingers. 
GLASS (CONT'D) Three days on horse? 
Spotted Horse nods... looks Glass over, and shakes his head. 
SPOTTED HORSE Not walk. 
Hides soon. 
Glass doesn't understand... until Spotted Horse points to a ROW OF BUFFALO HIDES hanging from a line. 
Spotted Horse (cont'd) We trade Bra-zo. 
Glass stares at the tanning hides, then down at his leg. 
Finally, he nods. 
Spotted Horse starts walking... waves for Glass to follow. 
Spotted Horse (cont'd) Come. 
Eat. 
Glass follows after him. 
The children sneak in behind, giggling as they tail Glass across camp. 
Glass glances back... 
New Moon and Little One duck behind a tee-pee... wait for him to continue before they scoot back out after him. 64. 
INT. CHIEF'S LODGE - NIGHT Glass, Spotted Horse, Three Feathers, Running Fox and OTHER WARRIORS sit around a fire, eating with CHIEF RED HAWK, the Medicine Man, and several other TRIBAL ELDERS. GLASS The men stole my rifle. 
The Sioux don't understand. 
Glass reaches over, taking Spotted Horse's plate. 
GLASS (CONT'D) They took. 
They took... 
Glass aims an imaginary rifle. 
GLASS (CONT'D) ...my rifle. 
My gear. 
Now Spotted Horse understands... translates for the others. 
GLASS (CONT'D) They left me to die. 
So I mean to find `em both. 
Get my rifle back. 
Spotted Horse translates again. 
Red Hawk nods, studying Glass. 
Red Hawk SAYS SOMETHING to Glass... motions to the BEAR CLAW NECKLACE. Glass looks to Spotted Horse. 
SPOTTED HORSE Red Hawk ask who kill griz-lee. 
Glass touches his chest. 
Red Hawk nods, impressed. 
Glass points to the JAGGED SCARS running up Red Hawk's neck to a MISSING RIGHT EAR. GLASS Grizzly? 
Red Hawk smiles... shakes his head. 
RED HAWK Arikara. 
That word, Glass understands. 
Red Hawk rambles a long sentence in Sioux. 
The other members LAUGH. 65. 
SPOTTED HORSE He say Arikara take right ear of Sioux. 
Left ear of whites. 
Not know what they take from you. 
Glass smiles along with the others. 
They continue their meal. 
EXT. SIOUX VILLAGE - DAY Snow falls over Glass, as he stands outside the tee-pee, flexing his injured leg... putting more weight on it... testing its recovered strength. 
Suddenly, a SPEAR PLANTS INTO THE GROUND BETWEEN HIS FEET. Glass turns, startled... sees Spotted Horse, Three Feathers, Running Fox, and several OTHER WARRIORS staring at him. 
Glass' eyes jump from the spear to the warriors, unsure. 
Spotted Horse strides to Glass... grabs the spear, then spins it sideways... stares at Glass, until a smile spreads across Spotted Horse's face... he holds the spear out to Glass. 
SPOTTED HORSE Buff-A-lo Man hunt with Sioux? 
Glass relaxes... nods... takes the spear from Spotted Horse. 
Three Feathers hands a BUFFALO HIDE to Glass... motions for Glass to put it on. 
THREE FEATHERS Tatanka Wicasa. 
Glass wraps the hide around him. 
The Warriors smile and nod. 
EXT. FOREST - DAY A world of silent white... like we're inside a giant snow- globe. 
The sky is emptying all the snow it has over us... pouring down... the only sound comes from the flakes hitting the already fallen snow. 
The pale trunks of Cottonwoods rise up from the white ground. 
Then out of the white... a SHAPE APPEARS... a GIANT WOLF WALKING ON ITS HIND LEGS. But as the wolf comes closer, we see it's not a wolf at all... it's THREE FEATHERS, wearing his WOLF SKIN. He CRIES OUT... 
HOWLING WILDLY. A few yards beside him, another WARRIOR is doing the same... 
CHANTING... beating his spear against the Cottonwoods as he walks. 66. 
GLASS - WEARING THE BUFFALO HIDE... ...walking slowly through the trees, carrying the spear. 
Yellow Bear is beside him... motions for Glass to spread out. 
FROM ABOVE THE TREES... ...we see the fur-covered warriors are formed into a wide circle... and slowly converging... 
YELLING... pounding their spears... making as much noise as possible, as they tighten their ring. 
POV FROM THE BRUSH... ...watching DISTANT CHANTING WARRIORS pushing through the trees. 
V.O. 
SNORTING... our POV darts sideways... charges through the brush... slides to a stop when we see Running Fox moving toward us... spins back another direction. 
GLASS - MOVING THROUGH THE FOREST... ...the falling snow clinging to his face... covering the buffalo hide. 
And then a MASSIVE SHAPE BLASTS through the trees ahead of him. 
Glass freezes, his grip tightening on the spear. 
He looks to Spotted Horse, who nods... 
YELLS OUT, beating his spear against the trees, and motioning for Glass to do the same. 
Glass is apprehensive at first... just lightly tapping his spear. 
But as the other warriors' chants grow, Glass gets caught up in the hunt... begins beating the trees... 
YELLING as loud as his throat will allow. 
THE WARRIORS - EYES PIERCING THROUGH THE SNOW... 
CHANTING... 
BEATING THE BUSHES. OUR LOW POV AGAIN - RACING CHAOTICALLY THROUGH THE BRUSH... ...to Spotted Horse waving his spear... back over the snow... to Three Feathers SCREAMING... we spin again... crash through bushes, then suddenly TUMBLE... 
DROP THROUGH THE SNOW. 67. 
GLASS - HEARING THE ANIMAL'S WAIL... ...seeing Spotted Horse pick up his pace... start trotting forward. 
Glass does the same... all the hunters converging around a LARGE BLACK HOLE IN THE SNOW... ...and the ELK trapped at the bottom. 
The warriors cry out victoriously... begin DRIVING THEIR SPEARS INTO THE TRAP, killing the animal. 
EXT. SIOUX VILLAGE - EVENING The elk roasts over a fire at the center of the village. 
Glass sits alone outside the tee-pee, using the sharp tip of the spear to carve into a small chunk of wood. 
As he carves, New Moon and Little One sneak around the tee- pee behind him... watch Glass work. 
Glass hears them GIGGLING... doesn't react... just keeps carving... tilts the long handle of the spear as he works, tapping the side of the tee-pee, and SHAKING LOOSE A CLUMP OF SNOW DOWN ONTO THE BOYS. The shocked boys freeze in the cold... wipe the snow from their faces to see Glass grinning at them. 
The little boys charge Glass, leaping onto him... wrestling him to the ground, as they squeeze his hair. 
BOYS Tatanka Wicasa! Tatanka Wicasa! Spotted Horse stands across the village, watching Glass and the boys play in the snow. 
EXT. SIOUX VILLAGE - NIGHT Glass stands at the edge of the village, carving at the wood with the spear tip, and watching the Sioux from a distance. 
Yellow Bear sees him... approaches, carrying his SON on his shoulders. 
The little boy gnaws on a strip of meat. 
Spotted Horse holds out a bowl of food to Glass. 
GLASS Thank you. 
SPOTTED HORSE Good hunt. 68. 
GLASS Yes. 
Glass smiles up at Spotted Horse's son. 
SPOTTED HORSE You. 
Fam-i-lee? 
GLASS (shakes his head) No. SPOTTED HORSE No wom-an? (pointing to son) Wakayaja? 
A long beat, then... 
GLASS No. Not for a long time. 
Glass continues eating... watches Spotted Horse bounce the giggling little boy on his shoulders. 
EXT. SIOUX VILLAGE - DAY Glass steps out of his tee-pee, whittling with the spear tip. 
He glances up... freezes because he sees several Sioux pulling the hides from the line... rolling them up to carry. 
Spotted Horse (O.S.) Bra-zo. 
Glass turns to Spotted Horse, pointing to the hides. 
Glass nods... looks back to the last of the hides being pulled down... doesn't seem as excited as he once might have been. 
EXT. SIOUX VILLAGE - LATER Spotted Horse and Three Feathers sit atop their horses. 
Three Feathers holds the reins to another horse packed with hides. 
An empty horse stands beside them... waiting for Glass. 
Glass is leaning over to New Moon and Little One... handing them the CRUDE BUFFALO CARVING he made from the wood. 
GLASS (taps his chest) Tatanka Wicasa. 69. 
The little boys smile. 
Glass nods to Waki, then waves to Red Hawk and the Medicine Man. 
They return it... watch Glass climb onto his horse. 
Glass, Spotted Horse and Three Feathers ride out of the village. 
EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY Glass, Spotted Horse and Three Feathers ride along a high ridge, surrounded by empty snow-covered wilderness. 
They have the world to themselves. 
EXT. CAMP - NIGHT Glass crouches over a shallow, five-foot long hole surrounded by deep snow. 
The hole is filled with small fires and rocks. 
And he's watching Spotted Horse and Three Feathers tossing rocks into their own matching holes, then dragging the dirt back into them. 
Spotted Horse throws a glance back to Glass, making sure he understands. 
Glass nods... pulls the dirt back in, covering the flames. 
He watches Spotted Horse spread a blanket over the warm ground, then does the same. 
He sits on the mound of dirt... leans back against a tree... feels the warmth rise up from beneath him. 
He nods to Spotted Horse, who is already resting under his blanket. 
GLASS Nice. 
SPOTTED HORSE (NODS) Nice. 
Glass pulls the buffalo hide around himself... keeping watch. 
SPOTTED HORSE (cont'd) Sleep. 
No Arikara. 
Glass nods... but still doesn't close his eyes. 
Spotted Horse tosses his knife over beside Glass. 
Glass takes it... nods to Spotted Horse. 
SPOTTED HORSE (cont'd) Me sleep. 70. 
Spotted Horse rolls over, turning his back on Glass... trusting him with the knife. 
Three Feathers does the same. 
Glass just stares out into the night. 
INT. FORT UNION/BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT Dark and quiet... except for the SNORING of a few men. 
Fitzgerald sleeps on his cot. 
A shadow glides across him... hovers over his face. 
Fitzgerald's eyes blink open. 
CUT TO: FITZGERALD'S POV... ...on GLASS STANDING OVER HIM... his scarred face calm and deadly... raising a knife to drive down into Fitzgerald's chest. 
FITZGERALD No... please. 
But Glass swings the blade. 
CUT TO: EXT. WILDERNESS - MORNING And Spotted Horse shaking Glass awake from his dream. 
Glass' hand flies up, the knife gripped. 
But Spotted Horse grabs his arm... stops it in mid-swing... holds it until Glass realizes it was a dream... relaxes. 
SPOTTED HORSE We go. 
Glass calms... nods. 
EXT. FORT BRAZEAU - DAY Just a small cluster of log buildings sitting along the banks of the Missouri. 
Dozens of tee-pees and tents are set up outside the complex. 
Glass follows Spotted Horse and Three Feathers into the camp. 
BEGGING INDIANS and DRUNK TRAPPERS paw at the men as they ride past, pleading for handouts. 71. 
One of the Indians grabs for the hides. 
Three Feathers plants his foot in the Indian's chest... shoves him back into the snow. 
They continue on... climb off their horses outside the TRADING POST. Three Feathers stays to guard the hides, as Spotted Horse and Glass enter. 
INT. TRADING POST - DAY A small, dingy room lined with shelves, all stacked high with pots, pans, dry goods, whiskey, blankets, weapons... anything that can be traded. 
KIOWA BRAZEAU, (60's), French-Canadian, stands behind the counter... looks up when the BELL over the door RINGS... sees Spotted Horse with Glass behind. 
BRAZEAU (thick French accent) Bon jour, Spotted Horse. 
You come with many hides I hope. (off Spotted Horse's nod) We make good trades then. 
Brazeau's eyes lock on Glass... stares at him, unsure. 
BRAZEAU (CONT'D) Monsieur Glass? 
GLASS Good to see you again, Mr. Brazeau. 
BRAZEAU Jesus Christ, what happened to your goddamned face? 
GLASS Had a tussle with a grizzly. 
Glass shakes Brazeau's hand. 
Brazeau studies his face... notices the Bear Claw Necklace... smiles. 
BRAZEAU And now the grizzly, he don't look so good either, eh? 
Glass shakes his head. 
BRAZEAU (CONT'D) (off Spotted Horse) You run with the Sioux these days? 72. 
GLASS They looked after me for a spell. 
I'm on my way to catch back up with Captain Henry... at Fort Union. 
Needed to trade for some supplies on the Company's credit if I could. 
BRAZEAU Oui, of course. 
Anything you like. 
Glass pulls down a KENTUCKY LONG RIFLE. GLASS We can start with this. 
INT. TRADING POST - LATER Glass is loaded with gear. 
He signs a ticket for Brazeau. 
BRAZEAU You can pick up the horse at the livery in the morning. (off Glass' nod) I wish I could give you a room for the night, but... 
Brazeau looks to SEVERAL TRAPPERS standing across the room, glaring at Glass. 
BRAZEAU (CONT'D) I cannot risk the trouble of letting a colored stay inside. 
Glass glances to the trappers... one of them spits in Glass' direction... makes some MONKEY SOUNDS... daring Glass to respond. 
Glass just turns away. 
GLASS Won't be the last night I sleep on the ground. 
Glass nods to Brazeau, then walks out. 
BRAZEAU Take care of that face, Glass. 
EXT. TRADING POST - DAY Spotted Horse and Three Feathers sit on their horses. 
The other horses are now packed with new goods. 
Glass approaches. 73. 
GLASS (points to the tents) You stay here tonight? 
Spotted Horse shakes his head... motions back toward the wilderness. 
Then he points to the trading post... the TRAPPERS. SPOTTED HORSE Your people? 
Glass looks back to all the white faces... trappers, drunks, prostitutes. 
He shakes his head. 
GLASS No. SPOTTED HORSE You come then. 
Spotted Horse taps his own chest... points back the way they came. 
Glass hesitates, almost like he's considering it... then he shakes his head again... points the opposite way. 
GLASS Fort Union. 
Spotted Horse stares at Glass a long beat, then... 
SPOTTED HORSE You spend your life hunting enemy. 
Enemy wins. 
GLASS It will be over soon. 
Then Glass pulls the Bear Claw Necklace off... hands it to Spotted Horse. 
Spotted Horse holds it... then proudly slides it over his head. 
GLASS (CONT'D) (IN SIOUX) Thank you. 
Spotted Horse raises his hand in goodbye, then spins his horse and starts away. 
Three Feathers does the same. 
Glass returns it... watches them ride off. 
EXT. FORT BRAZEAU - NIGHT Glass is in the trees beyond the tents and tee-pees... crouched on the ground... 74. dragging the dirt back over the fire and rocks. 
He slides up onto the mound... feels the warmth, and smiles... just a little. 
EXT. MISSOURI RIVER - MORNING Glass rides a PAINT MARE along a ridge overlooking the river. 
Fort Brazeau stands in the distance behind him. 
EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - DAY Snowy and cold. 
Glass leads the line of riders through the snow. 
EXT. FORT UNION - EVENING But you can't tell if it's day or night through the blizzard. 
Fitzgerald, Pig, Anderson, Bridger, Murphy and Stubby Joe trudge through the snow in their snowshoes... finally reach the bunkhouse. 
INT. BUNKHOUSE - EVENING Anderson shoves the door closed against the wind... latches it. 
The men look worn and battered... wind-burnt faces, icicles in their beards. 
FITZGERALD I had enough of this cold as hell shit. 
ANDERSON What'd you figure when ya signed on outta that St. Louis whorehouse you was workin'? 
That you was headin' off to paradise? 
Pig snorts a laugh at Fitzgerald's expense. 
FITZGERALD I tell ya what I figured, I figured I'd be somewhere the piss wouldn't freeze before I got it outta my pecker. 
BRIDGER Figured wrong. 75. 
Fitzgerald throws Bridger a glare... wants to throw more, but Bridger's returning the stare... hard... so Fitzgerald decides he'd better not push it. 
FITZGERALD Waste a time to check traps in this weather... while Henry sits warmin' his ass on the stove in his office. 
STUBBY BILL Why don't you go tell him that, Fitz? 
Then start your hike back to St. Louie. 
FITZGERALD Shit, I walked up here, I got no problem walkin' back. 
MURPHY Contracted for twelve months. 
We all did. 
FITZGERALD Henry can shove that contract up his toasty warm ass, or I'll do it for him. 
The others laugh at Fitzgerald's rambling. 
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) You don't think I will? 
The men shake their heads. 
Fitzgerald grabs his gloves... starts strapping his snowshoes back on. 
ANDERSON Just give that fat little whore you're so sweet on a couple extra bits... she'll have you thinkin' it's Spring already. 
The men laugh as Fitzgerald walks out... leaves the door wide open for the cold wind to pour over the others. 
Pig scurries over, shoving it closed. 
As the other men gather around a table to play cards, Bridger pulls a JOURNAL from under his cot... falls onto the cot, and starts writing. 
INT. ROCKY MOUNTAIN FUR COMPANY OFFICE - EVENING Fitzgerald enters... looks around the empty office. 76. 
FITZGERALD Hello? 
Captain? 
The place is empty. 
Fitzgerald eyes Henry's desk... then past his desk... to the SAFE... its door CRACKED OPEN... 
STACKS OF MONEY visible inside. 
Fitzgerald glances around... looks back to that safe. 
EXT. FORT UNION - NIGHT Dark and quiet. 
The snow has stopped. 
INT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT Fitzgerald eases up from his cot... looks around at the sleeping men. 
EXT. FORT UNION - NIGHT Fitzgerald slips out of the bunkhouse door... across the compound... toward the front gate. 
MURPHY (O.S.) Where're you headed? 
Fitzgerald looks up... sees Murphy in the Blockhouse on sentry duty. 
FITZGERALD To the river, Murphy. 
Murphy squints down into the shadows. 
MURPHY That you, Fitzgerald? 
FITZGERALD Left my rifle down there... don't want it out all night. 
MURPHY That weren't too smart. 
FITZGERALD Just don't take a shot at me when I come back in. 
MURPHY We'll see. 77. 
Murphy waves Fitzgerald out. 
FITZGERALD Not that you'd hit me if you tried. 
Murphy fakes a laugh... raises his rifle down at Fitzgerald. 
CUT TO: POV DOWN MURPHY'S RIFLE... ...on Fitzgerald moving toward the river... disappearing into the darkness. 
EXT. MISSOURI RIVER - NIGHT Out of sight from the fort. 
Fitzgerald slides the ANSTADT FROM UNDER HIS COAT... hurries down the bank... searches under the brush and snow... pulls out an OVERTURNED CANOE. He drags it to the icy edge... slides it across the ice toward the middle of the river, where the water still hasn't frozen over. 
The ice CRACKS UNDER HIS FEET. Fitzgerald climbs in the canoe... pounds the ice with the oar, breaking it loose. 
The current seeps through the cracks... catches the canoe, pulling it to the center of the wide river... sends Fitzgerald shooting south. 
He throws a glance back at the shadow of Fort Union in the distance... growing smaller. 
EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY Clear blue sky. 
The sun glistening off the snow-covered ground. 
Glass is bundled under furs, as he rides through the snowy trees. 
EXT. WILDERNESS/CAMP - NIGHT Tucked under the rooftop of trees. 
A small fire burns. 
Glass sits on his fire-bed, looking over a map. 
An O.S. 
SNORT from the Paint Mare, tied to a tree. 
Glass looks over in time to see the horse's ears perk up. 
With his eyes searching the darkness, Glass slowly reaches over... grabs his rifle. 
Then he drops to his stomach... slides backward into the brush. 78. 
Glass peers through the brush... the woods seem empty... until SEVERAL DARK SHAPES APPEAR... moving through the distant trees... coming straight toward Glass' camp. 
Then an O.S. 
SNAP BEHIND GLASS... he glances back in time to see an ARIKARA WARRIOR SWINGING A HATCHET. Glass spins his rifle... shoves it into the stomach of the Warrior as he swings... 
BOOM... the Warrior flies back. 
The dark woods suddenly ERUPT IN WAR CRIES... 
Arikara appear from all sides... charge toward the camp. 
Glass scrambles up... races toward the Paint Mare as ARROWS AND GUNSHOTS FLASH THROUGH THE AIR ALL AROUND HIM. Glass swings up onto the Paint Mare... spots ELK'S TONGUE leading the charge... the necklace of ears hanging around his neck. 
And Elk's Tongue's eyes are locked on Glass... almost like he remembers him. 
Glass takes off through the forest. 
EXT. FOREST - NIGHT Glass hanging onto the paint mare, as she gallops through the trees... the animal's nostrils spread wide, pulling in all the oxygen it can. 
Glass glances back... sees SHAPES BEHIND HIM... 
HORSES... ridden by Elk's Tongue and eight other warriors. 
Glass digs his heels into the horse, squeezing every ounce of speed from her legs... pushing her toward the clearing up ahead... throwing another glance back... then looking in front of him, and realizing it isn't a clearing at all... ...it's the edge of the world. 
The paint mare explodes from the trees, then runs out of ground... because she's just galloped off the side of a cliff. 
The horse sails downward toward a thick forest of trees, its legs flailing for something to stand on. 
Glass drops the rifle to grip the horse's mane, hanging on for what seems an endless fall. 79. 
The mare SLAMS LEG-FIRST INTO THE TREE-TOPS with Glass still on her back. 
The Paint Mare SQUEALS as she drops into the snow-covered trees, carrying Glass with her. 
CUT TO: EXT. FOREST - CONTINUOUS And the horse comes crashing through the branches... the massive limbs slowing her fall... snapping off as her body hits and twists... tosses Glass away. 
The Paint Mare continues her deadly descent, the trees tearing at her body... catching her head... 
SNAPPING her neck. 
Glass slams off a branch... tumbles to the ground with a thud. 
The Paint Mare hits the snow beside him... very dead. 
Glass struggles to breath... finally GASPS... sucks in the oxygen. 
He lays there a moment... stares up through the trees... ...to Elk's Tongue and the others staring down from the top of the cliff... with no way to get to Glass. 
Glass rises to his knees... glances around for his rifle... lost. 
He flinches with what must be broken ribs... drags himself up, and staggers to the horse... pulls his knife and cuts the snowshoes from the back of the saddle. 
He throws the snowshoes over his shoulder... continues on, through the woods... alone... in the middle of nowhere... again. 
EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - DAY From high above... the small shape of Glass making his way over the snowy ground... heading toward TWO DISTANT SHACKS. EXT. FORT TALBOT - DAY A makeshift town on the banks of the Missouri. 
Two ramshackle structures... the General Store and a tattered livery stable filled with horses. 80. 
INT. FORT TALBOT/GENERAL STORE - DAY More like a saloon that sells a few supplies. 
A gang of TRAPPERS drink and play cards. 
A RUNTY MAN stands behind the counter, watching them... ...until the door blows open, and in steps Glass. 
He pulls the fur hat away from his face, and what a sight he is... scarred face stiff from the cold... ice frozen in his beard. 
The room falls silent... everyone staring at Glass. 
Until TRAPPER #1 snorts a laugh. 
Glass limps to the counter. 
All eyes follow him. 
GLASS (struggling to make his frozen lips move) I'm Hugh Glass of... 
RUNTY MAN We don't serve niggers. 
Glass stares at the Runty Man a beat, then... 
GLASS Of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company on my way to Fort Union. 
RUNTY MAN I don't care if you was with Lewis and Clark headed for the new world. 
We don't serve niggers. 
GLASS All I need is a horse and enough supplies to... 
TRAPPER Ice musta froze up his ears, `cause he ain't listenin' to you, Cees. 
GLASS ...to get me to Fort Union. 
I can sign a draft made good by Captain Henry. 
The Runty Man just stares at Glass... grins a TOOTHLESS GRIN. RUNTY MAN What the fuck happened to your face, boy? 
You try to slice all the black off? 81. 
TRAPPER #2 Maybe we oughta help him do it right. 
FAT TRAPPER Best get on your way, boy. 
Glass stares back at the men for a long beat, then... 
GLASS I'm Hugh Glass of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company, and all I need is... 
RUNTY MAN (to the trappers) Do you believe this shit? 
Trapper #1 and Trapper #2 pull the SKINNING KNIVES from their belts... start toward Glass. 
FAT TRAPPER Hell, I warned ya. 
GLASS All I need... 
And that's when Trapper #1 grabs for Glass, but in a flash of movement that catches them all off-guard, Glass has is own knife pulled and JAMMED UNDER TRAPPER #1's CHIN. Everyone freezes. 
GLASS (CONT'D) ...is a horse and enough supplies to get me to Fort Union. 
Then Glass slides Trapper #1's PISTOL from his belt... aims it at the other men. 
GLASS (CONT'D) And this shooter here. 
All made good by Captain Henry and The Rocky Mountain Fur Company. 
EXT. FORT TALBOT - DAY The snow pours down on the Runty Man and the trappers, as they stand outside, rifles aimed into the distance. 
RUNTY MAN Shoot him, goddammit! 82. 
TRAPPER #2 I can't get a clear look. 
RUNTY MAN Shoot `em both! The Runty Man snatches one of the rifles... 
BOOM... fires a wild shot past the riders. 
CUT TO: GLASS - GALLOPING AWAY ON HORSEBACK... ...with Trapper #1 sitting backward on the horse behind him. 
Glass has the pistol jammed into his ribs, and keeps glancing back to the men growing smaller behind him. 
Finally, Glass shoves the man off the back of the horse. 
Trapper #1 tumbles into the snow. 
The RUMBLE OF DISTANT GUNSHOTS... too far away to reach Glass, who just keeps racing north. 
CUT TO: THE RUNTY MAN - WATCHING GLASS ESCAPE. RUNTY MAN Get after the son of a bitch! The trappers exchange glances... don't move. 
TRAPPER #2 It's cold as hell, Cees. 
FAT TRAPPER And he did say to put it all on the Rocky Mountain tab. 
The Runty Man glares at the trappers. 
EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - EVENING Glass riding the horse at a trot through the snow. 
EXT. FORT UNION - NIGHT Thick with fog, and silent as death. 
The moon fights its way through the mist, sending an eerie glow over the fort. 83. 
EXT. FORT UNION/BLOCKHOUSE - NIGHT Stubby Bill sits dozing in a chair, his rifle across his lap. 
O.S. 
CRUNCHING... getting louder... loud enough to nudge Stubby Bill awake. 
He sits up... peers over the wall, but can't see anything in the fog... just hears the CRUNCHING MOVING CLOSER... 
FOOTSTEPS IN THE CRISP SNOW. CUT TO: STUBBY BILL'S POV... ...on the blanket of fog hanging in the air... that same CRUNCHING, as a SHADOW APPEARS... growing clearer... a FIGURE walking... leading a horse behind him... appearing out of the mist like a ghost... 
GLASS. STUBBY BILL - STARES DOWN IN SHOCK... ...sure his eyes are betraying him. 
But then Glass looks straight up at Stubby Bill, and there's no doubt. 
STUBBY BILL Jesus Christ. 
INT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT Dark and quiet... just Pig's snoring rattling the silence. 
Suddenly the door kicks open... 
SLAMS into the wall... and there's GLASS' SILHOUETTE FILLING THE DOORWAY. GROANS from the awakened men... hands moving through the dark for oil lamps... turning them bright... until the room's fully lit... and they all see Glass standing there... eyes floating across the room, searching for a target. 
The men just stare back at him, like they're all part of the same dream. 
Except for Bridger, who's propped up in his cot like he's been waiting all night... waiting every night... for Glass to appear in that doorway. 
BRIDGER I'm sorry. 
Glass raises the stolen pistol... aims it at Bridger. 
And the young man doesn't flinch... almost as if he wants to make sure Glass doesn't miss. 84. 
The other men just watch in silence, not sure what the hell's going on. 
Glass holds his aim on Bridger's face... a face that's haunted him... kept him alive. 
GLASS You took everything I had... left me to die. 
Glass walks toward Bridger, the gun still raised... each step of his feet on the wood floor is like the thud of an executioner's drum. 
MUMBLING from the other men, as they watch this ghost reach Bridger... stand over him, the pistol aimed down. 
GLASS (CONT'D) Why? 
BRIDGER I was scared of dyin'. (BEAT) But every day since, I've wished I had. 
Glass' finger tightens on the trigger, ready to make Bridger's wish come true. 
The rest of the bunkhouse watches this execution in wide- eyed, stone silence, afraid to move. 
GLASS There wasn't no `Ree that night, was there? 
A long beat, then... 
BRIDGER No. Glass PISTOL WHIPS BRIDGER, knocking him to the floor. 
And before Bridger can crawl away, Glass in over him... those aching, frozen fists beating mercilessly down on Bridger. 
And Bridger doesn't fight back... just does his best to cover up, but the blows keep coming, and Bridger's face is covered in blood... ...just as Henry runs inside, half-dressed from where Stubby Bill awoke him. 
Henry grabs Glass... pulls him off. 
Glass spins... jams his pistol right in Henry's face. 85. 
HENRY Hugh. 
Wait. 
Glass is crazy with rage... barely stops himself from pulling that trigger. 
But finally, he calms... his arm sinks, lowering his aim. 
He glances around the bunkhouse. 
GLASS Where's Fitzgerald and my rifle? 
HENRY Deserted two days ago. 
Along with about five hundred dollars of company money. (BEAT) Let's get some coffee to warm you up. (to Glass, but looking at BRIDGER) I wanna hear what happened. 
Glass looks back to Bridger... they hold a long stare, until Glass walks out. 
BRIDGER Wait. 
Please! But Glass and Henry disappear, leaving Bridger alone with all those eyes burning into him. 
Bridger looks to Pig, but Pig just lowers his eyes... can't even look at the boy. 
The men step into their boots and furs... file out after Glass and Henry... leaving Bridger alone in the bunkhouse. 
INT. ROCKY MOUNTAIN FUR COMPANY OFFICE - NIGHT Glass sits by the warmth of the stove, sipping coffee. 
Henry's behind he desk, with the other men scattered around. 
GLASS I cut the shoes loose of her, and hiked over to Fort Talbot. 
STUBBY BILL Christ almighty. 
GLASS And you may hear from the fella there about a stoled horse and supplies charged to you. 86. 
HENRY We'll take care of it. 
You should go settle in. 
MURPHY There's a couple fair whores next door that'll ease the miles on ya, scars or not. 
Stubby Bill gives Murphy an elbow. 
ANDERSON Jesus, Murph. 
MURPHY I just meant I'd go roust one of `em for ya if you wanted. 
GLASS She can take the night off, but I wouldn't mind the use of her bed. 
HENRY (TO MURPHY) Go clear out a room. 
The rest head on back to bunk. 
Murphy hustles out. 
The others move toward the door, each stopping to shake Glass' hand, or give him a pat on the back. 
PIG I told ya I'd see ya up here. 
You remember that, Hugh? 
GLASS I do, Pig. 
You must have a little gypsy in ya. 
Pig grins and nods. 
PIG I'll see ya in the mornin'. 
Pig exits, leaving just Glass and Henry, sitting in a beat of silence, until... 
HENRY Can I talk you outta what you're planning? 
Glass doesn't answer... just stands, placing the coffee cup on the table. 87. 
GLASS Thank you for what you done for me... stitchin' me back together... givin' me a chance. 
HENRY I'm offerin' you another right now... to stay here... let this thing go. 
GLASS (BEAT) He thinks he let me die. 
But he don't know that he's the one that's kept me alive... for the chance of findin' him... makin' him pay for what he done. 
HENRY The law will make Fitzgerald pay. 
Glass stares out the window... his SCARRED REFLECTION stares back at him. 
GLASS You told me once that other men didn't think like him. (BEAT) But the truth is, most do. 
I seen it my whole life... the looks folks give... the whisperin'. 
I watched my wife and son die from the fever on accounta no white doctor would care for `em. 
Wasn't no different to them than if their neighbor's dog was sick. (BEAT) So I don't figure nobody's gonna care much that Fitzgerald took some dyin' nigger's rifle, and left him in the middle of nowhere. (turns to Henry) Do you, Captain? 
Henry doesn't answer... because he knows Glass is right. 
GLASS (CONT'D) I thank you for the coffee. 
Glass walks out. 
Henry just sits there. 88. 
EXT. FORT UNION - DAY Glass, Pig and Murphy stand by Glass' horse, as he ties off his supplies. 
MURPHY He said he was goin' to get his rifle... 
And then Murphy catches himself... shrugs. 
MURPHY (CONT'D) Your rifle. 
But he never showed back up. 
The next day I figured him mighta fell in, but then Pig seen the canoe was missin'. 
PIG And the Captain found the money gone. 
GLASS I'll make my way down river. 
See what turns up. 
Glass pulls the cinch tight around the horse. 
Stubby Bill comes waddling toward them. 
STUBBY BILL The kid's gone... gear and all. 
Musta slipped out before light. 
Stubby Bill waves Bridger's journal at them. 
STUBBY BILL (cont'd) Just left this on his bunk. 
Henry takes the journal... flips it open. 
HENRY (READING) "Every day I think about what I done. 
I want to tell Pig and the others the truth but am afraid what they'll think of me. 
I look at Fitzgerald and want to kill him but am afraid to try. 
I am a coward and wish he hadn't been lyin about the Ree that night. 
I wish they had come and kilt us both." Glass considers the words a beat, then swings onto his horse. 89. 
GLASS If I run across the boy, I'll send him back your way. 
Glass sees Henry on horseback, trotting toward them. 
GLASS (CONT'D) Where're you headed? 
HENRY Fitzgerald stole five hundred dollars. 
Rocky Mountain Fur Company wants him too. 
GLASS I can do this on my own. 
HENRY I know you can. 
But maybe you won't have to. 
Glass stares at Henry a beat, then finally just pulls his horse around... heads for the river. 
Henry nods to Pig and Murphy as he follows after Glass. 
EXT. ROCK LEDGE - DAY From above Fort Union. 
Our POV on Glass and Henry riding south along the icy river. 
And then we see our POV is Bridger's... standing along the ledge, loaded with all his gear. 
He watches the riders another moment, then turns... hikes the opposite direction... leaving Fort Union behind forever. 
EXT. FORT TALBOT/GENERAL STORE - DAY The Runty Man behind the counter. 
A few of the same Trappers drinking... playing cards. 
Just another day at Fort Talbot. 
The door swings open, and a FUR-COVERED FIGURE enters. 
RUNTY MAN We ain't got no food to spare, friend, if that's what you're lookin' for. 
The figure pulls back his furs, and we see it's Fitzgerald... cold and miserable. 90. 
FITZGERALD Then what the hell have ya got? 
RUNTY MAN Whiskey and blankets mostly. 
Weather's held back deliveries. 
Fitzgerald throws a glance to the Trappers. 
FITZGERALD Gimme a couple bottles then. 
Goddamn ice shredded my boat. 
Been walkin' for two days. 
The Runty Man hands Fitzgerald the bottles. 
Fitzgerald pops one... gulps some down. 
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) How much for one of them horses out there? 
RUNTY MAN Horses ain't cheap this time a year. 
FITZGERALD Whatever the price, Rocky Mountain Fur Company's good for it. 
And those words stop everything. 
The Trappers all turn from their game. 
The Runty Man glares at Fitzgerald. 
RUNTY MAN You're the second son of a bitch come in here makin' that claim. 
And the first one left a bad taste. 
FITZGERALD That right? 
Well I don't know nothin' about that. 
Just that I need a horse. 
RUNTY MAN So did this other fella. 
So he stole one... along with Lange's pistola. 
Trapper #1 nods to Fitzgerald. 
FITZGERALD Fine then, I'll pay cash for the horse. 
How much? 91. 
RUNTY MAN How `bout you pay for your friend's too. 
TRAPPER #1 And my shooter. 
FITZGERALD Wasn't my friend. 
Trapper #1 stands up. 
TRAPPER #1 Then from where I stand, you don't got no friends at all. 
The other Trappers glare at Fitzgerald. 
The Runty Man just grins that toothless smile of his. 
Fitzgerald's in a bind, and he knows it. 
FITZGERALD Yeah, okay. 
I'll collect from him. 
How much? 
RUNTY MAN How `bout we say eighty... (sees Fitzgerald doesn't ARGUE) ...five. 
Fitzgerald starts digging into his pocket. 
FITZGERALD You boys are leavin' me with nothin'. 
Better be a helluva horse. 
RUNTY MAN Pick of the litter. 
The Runty Man snatches the cash. 
RUNTY MAN (cont'd) And when you see that scarred-up nigger, you tell him he'd best not show up here again. 
Fitzgerald freezes... not sure he heard correctly. 
FITZGERALD When I see who? 92. 
RUNTY MAN The black son of a bitch that robbed me. 
You tell him that. 
A long beat, then... 
FITZGERALD Scarred up, you say... and headed up to Union? 
RUNTY MAN That's what he told us. 
Seemed real anxious to get there too. 
FITZGERALD (NODS) I'll make sure to give him the message when I find him. 
EXT. FORT TALBOT - DAY Fitzgerald sits on the horse, staring back over the ground... his LINE OF TRACKS LEADING THROUGH THE SNOW. He turns... looks south, then back to the tracks. 
Finally, Fitzgerald digs his heels into the horse. 
The animal takes off, right along Fitzgerald's tracks in the snow... right back toward Glass. 
EXT. MISSOURI RIVER - DAY Thick ice along the edges, tapering to a narrow stream of flowing water at the very center. 
Glass and Henry ride along the snow-covered bank. 
HENRY Hugh. 
Henry points. 
Glass follows his finger along the river... to a CANOE resting on the bank ahead. 
They dismount... examine the canoe... the letters "RMFC" painted on the side. 
HENRY (CONT'D) That's it. 
Glass runs his mittened hand along the gashes in the wood. 
GLASS Ice tore it up. 93. 
Glass looks to the FOOTPRINTS IN THE SNOW, leading deep into the trees. 
He glances up to the sky... clear and blue. 
GLASS (CONT'D) If the snow holds off, we'll have a good trail to track. 
HENRY What's out that direction? 
Talbot? 
GLASS And the Missouri. 
Doubt he'd risk the river with the `Ree. 
Likely grab a horse, and cross over high... take his chances goin' east against the weather. 
When'd you say he skipped out? 
HENRY Three days ago now. 
GLASS We best pick up our pace. 
They climb back onto their horses... trot into the trees. 
EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - DAY Glass and Henry gallop across, their path dead on Fitzgerald's tracks. 
EXT. FOREST - DAY The snow is shallow here, the ground protected by the trees. 
There's a black spot where a fire once burned, and footprints all over the place. 
Glass is off his horse, crouched, studying the site... lifting the charred chunks of wood. 
HENRY This was Fitzgerald camped here? 
GLASS Couple nights back. 
But these tracks aren't all his. 
HENRY He's travelin' with somebody? 94. 
GLASS (shakes his head) Came in after. 
Prints are smooth. 
Mocassins. 
Henry throws Glass a look... he knows what that means. 
GLASS (CONT'D) Could be Sioux... 
Blackfoot even. 
HENRY But you figure they're `Ree. 
GLASS I don't figure nothin', Captain. 
But whoever it is, they're a good day behind Fitzgerald. 
Glass walks, leading his horse, as he follows the tracks away from camp. 
Henry rides after him. 
GLASS (CONT'D) And they're on his trail too, so we should keep it quiet... don't announce we're back here. 
HENRY You told me once you knew enough to keep away from the `Ree. 
GLASS I do. 
HENRY You figure this is smart then? 
Glass swings up onto his horse. 
GLASS You're welcome to head back, Captain. 
Glass trots off. 
Henry watches him a beat, then throws a glance into the trees... follows after Glass. 
EXT. WILDERNESS/CAMP - NIGHT Glass kneels on the ground, building a fire-bed... dragging the dirt over the fire and rocks. 
Henry's under a blanket, watching him. 95. 
HENRY What if we find Fitzgerald... and I ask you not to do this? 
Glass spreads a blanket over the ground. 
GLASS Don't ask me. 
Glass settles in on the warm earth. 
Henry just keeps watching him. 
EXT. WILDERNESS/CAMP - LATER ANGLE ON HENRY... ...asleep under the blanket. 
O.S. 
RUSTLING sends his eyes flashing open. 
He raises up... rifle ready. 
He glances at Glass, who puts a finger over his lips. 
HENRY (WHISPERS) `Ree? 
Glass doesn't answer... just keeps searching the brush. 
Henry's groggy eyes dart around the night... spots MOVEMENT IN THE BRUSH. HENRY (CONT'D) There! GLASS Wait! But it's too late... 
Henry fires... 
BOOM... the shot explodes through the night... ...and the DEER leaps away. 
Henry looks to Glass... shakes his head... sorry. 
HENRY So much for stayin' quiet. 
CUT TO: 96. 
FITZGERALD - SQUATTING BESIDE A SMALL FIRE... ...staring out into the darkness, as the GUNSHOT ECHOES OVER HIM. Fitzgerald immediately throws dirt over the flames. 
EXT. WILDERNESS/CAMP - NIGHT Glass and Henry are loaded up, back on their horses. 
HENRY Guess you would've been better off on your own. 
GLASS We needed to pick up some time anyways. 
The two riders disappear into the dark trees. 
EXT. WILDERNESS/CLEARING - NIGHT Glass and Henry riding across a meadow. 
Glass stops... tilts his head back to sniff the air. 
HENRY Whatta ya got? 
GLASS Smoke. 
Glass pulls some snow from his horse's mane... tosses it in the air, and watches it blow to the side. 
Glass turns his horse toward the breeze... squints out into the night. 
GLASS (CONT'D) No more than mile out that way. (pulls his rifle) I'll head in from the west... you take the east. 
HENRY What if it's `Ree? 
GLASS Then we leave `em be... meet back up here. 97. 
Henry nods... 
Glass takes off at a trot. 
Henry veers the other direction... splitting up across the snow. 
EXT. FOREST - NIGHT Splinters of moonlight shoot through the pines. 
Glass on horseback, walking through the trees... appearing and disappearing. 
He spots something in the distance... the slightest of glows. 
Glass eases off his horse... wraps the reins around a branch. 
EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT Henry's already off his horse... leading it through the trees... searching as he walks. 
EXT. FOREST - NIGHT Glass moves silently through the darkness... rifle poised to aim and fire... just like the first time we saw him, perfectly comfortable in this world. 
His eyes shine in the darkness, drifting back and forth... picking up everything. 
He reaches the glow... the remains of a campfire. 
The slightest bit of dying smoke rises into the air. 
Glass crouches down, studying the surround ground... 
HOOF-PRINTS blended in with the other tracks. 
EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT Henry's horse is making too much noise with each step. 
He stops walking... wraps the reins around a tree... walks back around the horse... ...AND THERE'S FITZGERALD STARING AT HIM... ...Glass' Anstadt aimed and ready to fire. 
FITZGERALD Didn't figure an important man like you to be away from your stove on a night as cold as this, Captain. 
You lost? 
Henry just stares back at Fitzgerald and that rifle. 
His eyes drift to his own rifle, still strapped onto his saddle. 98. 
HENRY I'm here to save your life. 
FITZGERALD I done told you boys... 
I don't need savin' by you or nobody else. 
Henry knows he's only got one chance... he makes a grab for the rifle. 
EXT. FOREST - NIGHT Glass running his fingers across the tracks. 
Suddenly an O.S. 
GUNSHOT EXPLODES IN THE DISTANCE. Glass spins to it... races back through the trees toward his horse. 
EXT. FOREST - NIGHT Glass at full gallop through the woods... veering between trees... ducking branches. 
EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT Glass charges from the forest... spots Henry's horse standing in the trees... tears through the snow toward it... leaps off the still-moving animal in a fluid slide... hits the ground with his rifle ready... ...and sees HENRY'S BODY face-up in the snow. 
Glass drops to a knee... scans the darkness, as he slides over to Henry... ...and we see he's a bloody mess... a GUNSHOT WOUND in his chest leaking out onto the snow... 
HIS HEAD SCALPED... 
LEFT EAR SLICED OFF. Glass stands back up, turning in a circle, as he peers into the distance around him. 
But there's nothing out there. 
Glass SCREAMS in rage. 
He turns back to Henry... crouches down over him. 
GLASS You shouldn't a come. 
As Glass looks at Henry, he notices something... takes Henry by the chin, and tilts his head. 
And HENRY'S RIGHT EAR HAS BEEN CUT OFF AS WELL. 99. 
Glass stares at Henry a beat, then squints out into the forest. 
GLASS (CONT'D) (repeating Spotted Horse's words under his breath) Arikara take right ear of Sioux. 
Left ear of whites. 
Not know what they take from you. 
EXT. WILDERNESS/CLEARING - NIGHT Glass on horseback, leading Henry's horse behind him across the snow-covered meadow. 
Henry's fur-covered body is draped over the saddle. 
EXT. FROZEN RIVER - NIGHT A thick layer of ice covers the narrow river, thinning just a bit at the center. 
Glass kneels near the middle, chopping at the thick ice to get to the water beneath. 
He makes a hole... dips his canteen down into it, glancing around into the darkness. 
Then Glass turns... stares up a slope into the dark forest beyond... like he knows what's waiting for him there. 
He walks to the horses, tied in the trees at the base of the slope... 
Henry still laying across the saddle of his horse in his bloody furs. 
Glass SNAPS A BRANCH FROM A FALLEN TREE... looks back up that slope. 
EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT OUR POV FROM DEEP IN THE FOREST... ...watching from the shadowy brush, as Glass appears up over the distant slope... riding through the trees, with Henry draped over the horse behind. 
The forest is quiet... just the CRACKING of crusty snow and branches under the horses' hooves. 
Then BOOM... as the ANSTADT BARREL WE HADN'T SEEN BESIDE US FLASHES IN THE NIGHT... ...and Glass tumbles off his horse. 100. 
The horses prance around with a start, then settle... and then FITZGERALD RISES FROM THE BRUSH BESIDE US... eases toward the horses, reloading the Anstadt as he moves. 
He reaches Glass, face down in the snow... his furs covering him. 
And Fitzgerald has that rifle aimed, ready for Glass to suddenly roll over firing... ...but Glass doesn't move. 
Fitzgerald nudges him with his boot, then crouches down... grabs Glass by the shoulder, and pulls him over... ...and there's HENRY'S LIFELESS FACE HIDDEN BENEATH THE FURS... and that BROKEN BRANCH sticking up along his back. 
ANGLE FROM BEHIND HENRY'S HORSE... ...on the REST OF THE BRANCH RIGGED TO GLASS' SADDLE to hold Henry upright... ...and then what we thought was Henry flung over the second horse... 
MOVING... the bloody fur-covered arm lifting a rifle... the head raising up... it's GLASS... taking aim... ...as Fitzgerald realizes what's happened... spins with the Anstadt... ...to Glass laying across the horse... rifle dead set on Fitzgerald... 
BOOM... 
BOOM... both rifles explode... ...Fitzgerald goes flying backward into the brush. 
Fitzgerald's wild shot hits Henry's horse, sending it rearing up, tossing Glass to the ground. 
But Glass is on his feet in a flash... reloading as he charges into the brush... ...but FITZGERALD IS GONE. Until the flash of movement behind Glass... he turns... as the butt of the Anstadt whips through the air... 
WHACK... clubs him across the head, sending him tumbling down the slope to the frozen river. 
Fitzgerald swings the Anstadt back over his BLOODY SHOULDER, snatches up his knife, and charges down the slope to finish Glass off. 101. 
EXT. FROZEN RIVER - NIGHT Glass lies on the ice, barely conscious. 
Blood oozes down his head... over his eyes. 
He wipes it away to see Fitzgerald barreling down toward him. 
Fitzgerald dives in attack, but Glass kicks up his leg, sending Fitzgerald flying over... 
SLAMMING into the frozen river, his head CRACKING THE ICE. Glass rips the knife from his belt... moves after Fitzgerald, his feet slipping and sliding under him. 
Fitzgerald rises to his feet... the men charge like two wild animals... crash into each other... knives flailing. 
They roll along the ice, blades glistening... slicing through furs... across flesh. 
Fitzgerald thrusts his knife down... plants it through the back of Glass' hand, pinning it to the ice. 
Glass CRIES OUT... drops his own knife to pull Fitzgerald's out. 
As he does, Fitzgerald kicks Glass in the face, sending him sailing back... sliding to the center of the river. 
The thin ice around him splinters... cracks. 
Glass looks up... sees Fitzgerald stalking toward him, HOLDING BOTH KNIVES now. 
Glass is trapped... ...until he pounds his elbow down on the weakened ice... it begins to give... he pounds it again and again... 
Fitzgerald speeds up to get to Glass in time... raises one of the knives, as Glass shatters the ice... drops beneath the surface. 
Fitzgerald rushes after him, but the ice cracks under his feet, forcing him back. 
CUT TO: UNDERWATER... ...and Glass just under the ice, floating with the current. 
His fingers search for a hole, but there's nothing. 
CUT TO: 102. 
FITZGERALD... ...making his way down the river, peering through the ice, searching for Glass. 
He spots something... stops... leans close to make out the shape... it's GLASS' FEET. Then suddenly, GLASS' FIST EXPLODES THROUGH THE ICE AT FITZGERALD'S FEET... grab Fitzgerald's leg, pulling him down. 
Fitzgerald crashes to the ice... it splinters around him... gives away, and he sinks into the icy water... but the ANSTADT STRAPPED AROUND HIM CATCHES ON THE ICE... holds him against the current. 
Glass drags himself from the water... stands... stares down at Fitzgerald trapped in the hole... his face looking up at Glass through the ice. 
Glass lifts one of the fallen knives... stands over Fitzgerald. 
FITZGERALD (through the water and ICE) Help me! (off Glass' stare) Glass... please! Glass hesitates a beat, staring at him, just as he did with Bridger that night in the bunkhouse. 
And then Glass leans down... grabs the Anstadt to pull Fitzgerald up. 
Except Glass SLICES THE BLADE ACROSS THE STRAP OF THE ANSTADT, sending Fitzgerald floating away under the ice, as Glass holds on to the Anstadt. 
CUT TO: FITZGERALD... ...floating under the surface... pounding at the ice as he drifts, until his swinging slows... stops... his body drifts away. 
EXT. FROZEN RIVER - NIGHT Glass stands on the ice, blood dripping down his face, holding his Anstadt. 
He begins to tremble... not from the cold, but from finally reaching the end of this journey. 
His eyes begin to fill with tears... 103. ...and then he sees ELK'S TONGUE, and SEVERAL OTHER ARIKARA WARRIORS watching him from the other side of the river. 
Glass and Elk's Tongue exchange a long stare, until finally Glass SCREAMS OUT. GLASS I am Tatanka Wicasa! I have killed whites and I have killed Arikara and I have killed grizzly! AND I WILL KILL YOU! Elk's Tongue doesn't move... just stares back at Glass... soaked in blood and water. 
Then Glass CRIES OUT at the warriors again. 
GLASS (CONT'D) COME ON! But the Arikara don't attack... don't move at all... until Elk's Tongue gives Glass the SLIGHTEST OF NODS, then turns... they disappear back into the trees. 
Glass watches them fade away, then collapses to his knees on the icy river... exhausted in every possible way. 
He begins to cry. 
FADE OUT. 
THE END
STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS Written by Lawrence Kasdan, J.J. 
Abrams & Michael Arndt Based on characters created by George Lucas A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away... 
STAR WARS EPISODE VII THE FORCE AWAKENS Luke Skywalker has vanished. 
In his absence, the sinister FIRST ORDER has risen from the ashes of the Empire and will not rest until Skywalker, the last Jedi, has been destroyed. 
With the support of the REPUBLIC, General Leia Organa leads a brave RESISTANCE. She is desperate to find her brother Luke and gain his help in restoring peace and justice to the galaxy. 
Leia has sent her most daring pilot on a secret mission to Jakku, where an old ally has discovered a clue to Luke's whereabouts.... 
PAN across the star field to a bright moon. 
A RUMBLING is FELT. A VAST STAR DESTROYER -- unlike any we have seen -- HURTLES PAST US, of seemingly endless length, eclipsing the moon. 
After a long beat, FOUR TRANSPORT SHIPS fly from a hangar. 
We HOLD ON THEM NOW, as they fly off toward a distant planet. 
Jakku. 
MUSIC BUILDS AND WE... 
CUT TO BLACK. A GROWING ROAR of MEAN ENGINES -- gnarled RADIO CALLS, the SHUDDERING of a ship's hull. 
Then FLASHES OF LIGHT: for an instant we see a STORMTROOPER -- then BLACKNESS. Then ANOTHER STORMTROOPER, then it's gone. 
The FLICKERING CONTINUES until the LIGHTS ARE CONSTANT. We ARE IN: INT. TROOP TRANSPORT VEHICLE - NIGHT TWENTY STORMTROOPERS. Holding on at attention, moving to the ship's rhythm, in the tense moments before a raid. 
A FILTERED COMMAND and they LOCK AND LOAD their heavy blaster rifles. 
The BRUTAL NOISE is replaced by SUDDEN, SHOCKING QUIET: EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT WIDE SHOT of a small, peaceful village. 
Distant sounds of native animals. 
A single wind chime. 
Suddenly a DROID RISES INTO FRAME, CLOSE: ROUND and SKITTERY, orange and white, this is BB-8. 
Focuses on something past camera. 
He BEEPS -- FAST, MORSE CODE-LIKE SOUNDS, clearly worried. 
Moves EVEN CLOSER TO CAMERA -- is MORE worried -- BEEPS more -- then TURNS AND ROLLS OFF FAST -- INT. LARGE HUT - NIGHT CLOSE ON A HAND: a small LEATHER SACK is placed in the palm. 
The hand closes. 
Another OLDER HAND covers it. 
In a primitive HUT, an old explorer, LOR SAN TEKKA, (rugged, kind) has handed the mysterious sack to POE DAMERON (32, in a pilot's jacket). 
Poe has charisma, a natural spark: LOR SAN TEKKA This will begin to make things right. 
I've traveled too far, and seen too much, to ignore the despair in the galaxy. 
Without the Jedi, there can be no balance in the Force. 
POE Well, because of you now we have a chance. 
The General's been after this for a long time. 
LOR SAN TEKKA "The General." To me, she's royalty. 
Well, she certainly is that. 
POE BB-8 ENTERS FRANTIC, BEEPS. Concerned, Poe turns to Lor San Tekka. 
POE (CONT'D) We've got company. 
EXT. LARGE HUT - NIGHT The men exit fast. 
Poe moves TO CAMERA, raises QUADNOCULARS. POE'S POV: LIGHTS on the horizon -- approaching ENEMY SHIPS. POE lowers the quadnocs -- PUSH IN ON HIS UNNERVED EYES. A GROWING, FRIGHTENING THUNDER. POE You have to hide. 
LOR SAN TEKKA You have to leave. 
Go! Poe turns to him. 
Conflicted. 
Finally nods, hurries off. 
BB-8 follows. 
EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT TRACK FAST with Poe as he and BB-8 hurry through the village, various ARMED VILLAGERS taking position, prepared to defend. 
EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT A ROAR of WIND and DUST: the TRANSPORTS LAND. Stormtroopers come out FIRING BLASTERS -- the VILLAGERS FIRE BACK -- many are HIT! EXT. RISE ADJACENT TO VILLAGE - NIGHT Poe runs to an X-WING fighter, parked at a distance from the village, hidden behind a ROCK OUTCROPPING. POE Come on, BB-8! Hurry! Poe sends BB-8 into the droid socket / co-pilot seat -- he moves to the cockpit -- the CONTROLS COME TO LIFE. As the CANOPY CLOSES, Poe shoots a quick look back: the ENEMY ARRIVES IN THE DISTANCE. Poe urgently works the controls -- BB-8 BEEPS. The X-WING LANDING LIGHTS COME ON, ENGINES WHINE TO LIFE! But just then: Poe's ship is suddenly HIT BY BLASTERFIRE! Poe turns to look: two STORMTROOPERS CHARGE HIS WAY, FIRING! POE (CONT'D) I see 'em! BB-8 BEEPS nervously as Poe GRABS HIS CONTROLS and FIRES AT THEM, using the X-wing's drop-down antipersonnel blaster! The two Troopers are BLOWN AWAY in the large BLAST HITS! Poe tries to start the ship now, but the ENGINES SPUTTER. Concerned, he opens his canopy, jumps down, moves to the back of his ship: BAD DAMAGE ON THE REAR ENGINE PANEL. They're in trouble. 
EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT Lor San Tekka moves sadly through the village as STORMTROOPERS wielding FLAME THROWERS destroy structures. 
Surrendering Villagers are ROUNDED UP. Penned ANIMALS panic. 
EXT. RISE ADJACENT TO THE VILLAGE - NIGHT Back at the X-wing, Poe kneels beneath his ship, pulls from the leather sack a SMALL, OLD ARTIFACT which he inserts into BB-8 -- the droid's MULTI-READER ENVELOPS it. 
POE You take this. 
It's safer with you than it is with me. 
You get as far away from here as you can. 
Do you hear me? (BB-8 BEEPS, hesitates) I'll come back for you! It will be alright. 
BB-8 watches Poe run off. 
BEEP-WHINES nervously, then turns and heads off. 
Turns back once to look at Poe, then ROLLS AWAY. Poe uses his blaster rifle to fire at incoming troopers from cover. 
EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT The Troopers and villagers in battle -- as one Trooper is HIT and goes down. 
Another -- OUR TROOPER -- KNEELS to help. 
The hit trooper raises a torn, bloody glove -- his HUMAN HAND visible -- and MARKS OUR STORMTROOPER'S MASK WITH BLOOD just before he dies. 
Our Trooper, stands -- overwhelmed by the battle. 
AN IMPOSING SHUTTLE CRAFT -- VERTICAL WINGSPAN 90 FEET TALL -- LANDS NEAR THE TRANSPORT VEHICLES. The shuttle craft door OPENS -- through the wind and smoke, KYLO REN exits the ship: a TALL, DARK FIGURE, he strides through the chaos toward San Tekka. 
A senior Trooper moves to our blood-marked Trooper, and orders HIM: SENIOR TROOPER Stay here. 
Our Trooper nods. 
Kylo Ren stops before the outraged Lor San Tekka, dwarfing him. 
Only now does it become apparent that Kylo Ren wears a DARK MASK, marked by battle. 
Inset metal lines reflect FIRE. KYLO REN Look how old you've become. 
LOR SAN TEKKA Something far worse has happened to you. 
Our blood-marked TROOPER is placed in line with other stormtroopers. 
KYLO REN You know what I've come for. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: LOR SAN TEKKA I know where you come from. 
Before you called yourself Kylo Ren. 
KYLO REN The map to Skywalker. 
We know you've found it, and now you're going to give it to the First Order. 
Adjacent to the village, Poe enters frame -- sees the Ren/San Tekka exchange continue. 
LOR SAN TEKKA The First Order rose from the dark side... you did not. 
KYLO REN I'll show you the dark side. 
LOR SAN TEKKA You may try, but you cannot deny the truth that is your family. 
Suddenly Kylo Ren raises his LIGHTSABER -- IGNITES IT -- PERPENDICULAR SMALLER BLADES AT THE HILT, A UNIQUE BUZZ -- YELLOW/RED ENERGY, SPITTING SPARKS AND SMOKE -- KYLO REN You're so right. 
And as he RIPS IT DOWN ACROSS SAN TEKKA! Poe, RUNNING, SEES THIS AND YELLS, AIMS HIS BLASTER AND FIRES AT KYLO REN! Instantly: Kylo Ren RAISES HIS HAND -- POE'S BLAST FREEZES -- THE BOLT OF ENERGY STRAINING AND VIBRATING IN MID AIR! Kylo Ren sees Poe, who suddenly CANNOT MOVE, but strains to. 
He is grabbed by Stormtroopers who drag him past the VIBRATING, FROZEN BLAST, to Kylo Ren. 
A Stormtrooper begins a brutal PAT DOWN. Kylo Ren moves closer. 
Poe just glares. 
The Stormtrooper KICKS OUT Poe's legs -- he lands hard on his knees. 
Kylo Ren kneels to look at Poe. 
POE So who talks first? 
You talk first? 
KYLO REN The old man gave it to you. 
POE (INDICATES KYLO'S MASK) It's just very hard to understand you with all the... (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: KYLO REN (TO TROOPERS) Search him. 
POE ... 
Apparatus. 
The Troopers roughly pull Poe away. 
A Stormtrooper begins a brutal PAT DOWN. Kylo Ren moves closer. 
Poe just glares as the pat down ends. 
STORMTROOPER #1 Nothing, sir. 
KYLO REN Put him on board. 
Kylo Ren regards the Stormtroopers with the rounded up Villagers, then turns to the CHROME-SKINNED, FEMALE BLACK- CAPED HEAD STORMTROOPER, CAPTAIN PHASMA. CAPTAIN PHASMA Sir, the villagers. 
KYLO REN Kill them all. 
Phasma nods, steps forward: CAPTAIN PHASMA On my command! The Troopers, including OURS, aim at the Villagers. 
CAPTAIN PHASMA (CONT'D) Fire! Poe is roughly PULLED into a transport ship, the ramp LIFTS. All around our Trooper BLASTERFIRE ERUPTS -- but we're WIDE ENOUGH to see he ISN'T FIRING. PUSH IN until the FIRING STOPS. All the Stormtroopers SPREAD OUT TO SEARCH -- except ours. 
Kylo Ren heads back toward his ship. 
But then he STOPS. Feels something. 
TURNS AND LOOKS AT OUR STORMTROOPER for a LONG MOMENT. Our Trooper can barely meet his gaze; knows he's doomed. 
Kylo Ren then heads off -- passes the FROZEN BLAST, which, after a beat, GOES FREE AND SLAMS INTO A NEARBY STRUCTURE, scaring the hell out of our Stormtrooper. 
EXT. EDGE OF JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT A Stormtrooper climbs down from the cockpit of Poe's X-wing, BACKS AWAY: (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: STORMTROOPER #2 Nothing here. 
Go ahead! Three other Stormtroopers FIRE LASER CANNONS at the X-wing -- destroying the ship in a LARGE EXPLOSION. EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT BB-8 rolls across the sand, looks back: the X-wing FIREBALL. BB-8, afraid, continues on his own in a mysterious, dark desert. 
We see a FORM -- an animal, its RED EYES LIFTING from the sand, watching the rolling droid, who just keeps going. 
In a WIDE SHOT, we HEAR HIM BEEPING to himself, lonely and frightened. 
EXT. SPACE - NIGHT With the SANDY PLANET OF JAKKU as backdrop, Troop Transports and Kylo Ren's Shuttle approach a massive STAR DESTROYER. INT. STAR DESTROYER HANGAR - NIGHT Poe, shackled, is ushered from the transport through the hangar. 
He is awed by the imposing space. 
POE All right. 
All right! Our Stormtrooper passes, moves fast: INT. TROOP TRANSPORT VEHICLE - NIGHT Our Stormtrooper enters the dark, vehicle. 
He removes his helmet. 
His head comes up and we PUSH IN ON HIS FACE FOR THE FIRST TIME. This is FN-2187. 
He is 23, likable. 
But in this moment, terrified, desperate. 
After a beat, behind him, CAPTAIN PHASMA enters. 
FN-2187 knows he's in trouble. 
CAPTAIN PHASMA FN-2187. 
Submit your blaster for inspection. 
FN-2187 Yes, Captain. 
CAPTAIN PHASMA And who gave you permission to remove that helmet? 
FN-2187 I'm sorry, Captain. 
CAPTAIN PHASMA Report to my division at once. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: Phasma heads off. 
Shattered, FN-2187 replaces his helmet. 
CUT TO: INT. JUNKED VESSEL CORRIDOR - DAY A metal sheet is pulled open to reveal the wrapped up face of A SCAVENGER, perhaps alien, in GOGGLES, FACE MASK and GLOVES. Backpack with a STAFF strapped to it. 
Uses TOOLS to remove various MECHANISMS from inside the wall. 
We are in an upside-down, canted CORRIDOR. The Scavenger finds a valuable piece, drops it in a SATCHEL. Swings the bag back and begins CLIMBING DOWN on a cable, between treacherous WALLS OF MACHINERY, headed to: INT. JUNKED VESSEL - LARGER SPACE - LATER Alone and tiny in this massive, sideways wreck, the Scavenger descends, climbing down a two-hundred foot-long cable. 
LANDS HARD onto rusty metal. 
INT. JUNKED VESSEL - ENGINES - DAY The Scavenger carries the satchel and another large, found piece, over enormous pipes in the vast space, heads through the dust toward a distant SLIT OF SUNLIGHT. EXT. JUNKED VESSEL ENGINE - DAY The Scavenger arrives from the darkness and pulls off goggles and gear, revealing the grimy face of a beautiful, young WOMAN. This is REY, 19. 
She opens her canteen, shakes out the two final drops into her mouth. 
HITS THE SIDE of the canteen again and again for whatever she can get. 
CUT WIDE: Rey is rendered minuscule, standing at the bottom of an EPIC ENGINE OF A DECAYING, CRASHED STAR DESTROYER -- DISTANT SOUND of her canteen-hitting. 
She sets her things on a piece of sheet metal and sits next to it, sliding down the sand dune. 
She RIDES DOWN THE MOUNTAIN OF SAND. WE HOLD FOR A LONG TIME, looking down, as she recedes from us, toward the distant SALT FLATS below. 
Random SCATTERED DEBRIS. Her SPEEDER, tiny from here. 
Rey moves to her junker SPEEDER, jumps on, fires the sputtery engine and DRIVES OFF. EXT. DESERT - SPACESHIP GRAVEYARD - DAY Rey races along the desert floor: a GRAVEYARD OF CRASHED SPACESHIPS. EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY Rey's speeder PASSES us, heading for a dusty, desert town. 
Refueling, small trade, scavengers. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: CRASH! Rey's sack carrying her heavy FOUND OBJECTS hits the sand. 
Working like a tough seaman, Rey hauls the sack from her speeder toward the town. 
EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - CLEANING TABLE - DAY TIGHT ON REY'S HANDS as she SCRUBS CLEAN her day's salvage. 
Rey glances up: she looks at an old woman, also cleaning some salvage. 
Rey watches her, gets lost in the simple moment. 
A small, passing alien UNDERLING barks something to her in another language. 
She returns to work. 
INT. NIIMA TRADING STRUCTURE - DAY Rey looks up to a SERVICE WINDOW: two feet above her, behind a protective screen, is her boss, UNKAR PLUTT (50, blobfish, unclean). 
He examines her pieces. 
Then he offers: UNKAR What you've brought me today is worth... 
Hmmm... 
One quarter portion. 
Though disappointed, Rey barely shows it. 
She nods thanks. 
Unkar pushes through his transfer drawer a SEALED PACKET: DRIED GREEN MEAT in one section, BEIGE POWDER in another. 
She takes it. 
She swallows her resentment and heads off. 
EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY The IMMENSE SETTING SUN against the FLAT TERRAIN. Rey's SPEEDER races, almost insignificant, across frame. 
INT. REY'S DWELLING - DAY She SCRATCHES MARKS into the rusty wall. 
Another MARK; another DAY. And there are THOUSANDS of marks. 
A SIZZLING SOUND over: A DRIED DESERT FLOWER in a rusty ENGINE PIECE. A rough, stuffed HANDMADE DOLL, made from what looks like orange Rebellion flight suit material and twine. 
Rey's lonely, ramshackle dwelling. 
Everything reclaimed. 
She cooks for one. 
Does everything for one. 
She opens the POWDER, moves to the makeshift WOK, where the GREEN MEAT SIZZLES. Pours the powder into milky WATER in a tin. 
Stirs it. 
It GROWS INTO A LOAF as she puts the meat on an old plate. 
Grabs the loaf. 
EXT. REY'S DWELLING - DUSK Rey sits, eats like a starving child. 
Every last drop. 
Licks the metal plate. 
Looks out at the horizon. 
A single silent ship heads off, a shimmering, thin contrail. 
She wipes her mouth. 
Picks up an old, broken REBELLION HELMET. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: just 'cause. 
Puts it on, WIDE SHOT of Rey sitting, alone and isolated, on the leg of an ANCIENT, FALLEN AT-AT in which she lives. 
Then, a distant ELECTRONIC SQUEAL -- instantly she's up, helmet too big, she rips it off. 
Hears ANOTHER BEEPING SQUEAL. She hurries to her QUARTERSTAFF and runs off. 
Rey climbs a dune. 
RISE WITH HER, revealing BB-8, caught in a NET but fighting back, being held by a TEEDO (a small, brutish desert tyrant), who rides a LUGGABEAST. The teedo YELLS at BB-8, who BEEPS madly, struggling to free himself. 
Rey watches this injustice for a beat, finally YELLING OUT: REY Tal'ama parqual! The Teedo and BB-8 STOP, GO SILENT, turn to her. 
REY (CONT'D) Parqual zatana! A half beat and the Teedo YELLS SOMETHING BACK, threatening. 
BB-8's head swivels to him, then back to Rey, like watching a tennis match. 
Rey angrily moves to them, pulling a knife from her pouch. 
Rey starts CUTTING BB-8 out of the netting. 
The Teedo freaks out, YELLING. Rey suddenly stands, turns to the Teedo and says, fiercely: REY (CONT'D) NOMA. The Teedo barks a sort of "AHHHHH!" (As if to say, "GO TO HELL!"), Then heads off on his beast. 
This prompts BB-8 to start BEEP-YELLING at the departing bully, provocatively. 
REY (CONT'D) Shhhh. 
BB-8 quiets instantly. 
The two watch the Teedo head off. 
Finally, BB-8 BEEPS a question. 
She KNEELS to him. 
REY (CONT'D) That's just Teedo. 
Wants you for parts. 
He has no respect for anyone. 
Your antenna's bent. (considers BB-8 for the first time, STRAIGHTENS THE ANTENNA) Where do you come from? (BB-8 BEEPS) Classified. 
Really? 
Me too. 
Big secret. (points to horizon) Niima Outpost is that way, stay off Kelvin Ridge. (MORE) (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: REY (CONT'D) Keep away from the Sinking Fields in the north, you'll drown in the sand. (stands, heads off) BB-8 starts after her, BEEPS. She turns sharply, he stops. 
REY (CONT'D) Don't follow me. 
Town is that way. (he BEEPS again) No! She heads off again. 
Finally he BEEPS to her -- something SWEET this time. 
That he is alone, scared, has no one else. 
This makes her stop. 
She turns and looks at him. 
Not liking him. 
But a gesture of her head says, reluctantly, "Come on." BB-8 quickly moves to her. 
They head off together. 
REY (CONT'D) In the morning, you go. (HE BEEPS) You're welcome. 
The two disappear behind a dune. 
EXT. STAR DESTROYER - DAY Three TIE fighters head to the massive ship high above Jakku. 
INT. STAR DESTROYER HOLDING CELL - DAY POE, shackled to a chair, BEATEN, wakes up. 
KYLO REN I had no idea we had the best pilot in the Resistance on board. 
Comfortable? 
Through battered lips: POE Not really. 
KYLO REN I'm impressed. 
No one has been able to get out of you what you did with the map. 
POE Might wanna rethink your technique. 
Kylo Ren says nothing, reaches out to him. 
Poe flinches in the chair as Kylo Ren reaches for his face, not touching him. 
Poe is soon in agony, remains in horrible silence -- KYLO REN Where is it? (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: POE The Resistance will not be intimidated by you. 
KYLO REN Where... is it? 
Poe can't take it -- he BEGINS TO SCREAM and we CUT TO: INT. STAR DESTROYER CORRIDOR - DAY WHOOOSH! The cell door SLIDES UP. Kylo Ren exits, fierce, confronts GENERAL HUX (34, scary) who awaits him: KYLO REN It's in a droid. 
A BB unit. 
GENERAL HUX Well then. 
If it's on Jakku, we'll soon have it. 
KYLO REN I leave that to you. 
EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY BB-8 is dropped to the sand. 
REY Don't give up. 
He still might show up. 
Whoever it is you're waiting for. 
Classified. 
I know all about waiting. 
BB-8 BEEPTALKS a question. 
REY (CONT'D) For my family. 
They'll be back. 
One day. 
Come on. 
She tries to force a smile, but can't, really. 
She heads off. 
BB-8 BEEPS... then heads after her. 
INT. NIIMA TRADING STRUCTURE - DAY Rey stands with BB-8 in front of Unkar Plutt, at his window. 
He reviews her goods. 
He glances quickly at BB-8. 
UNKAR These five pieces are worth... 
Let me see here... 
One half portion. 
REY (OBJECTS) Last week they were a half portion each. 
She hates him. 
He leans forward. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: UNKAR What about the droid? 
REY What about him? 
UNKAR I'll pay for him. 
BB-8 doesn't like this at all. 
Rey is awkward, but curious. 
UNKAR (CONT'D) Sixty portions. 
CLOSE ON HER. Stunned. 
Literally hungry for this amount of food, her stomach practically rumbles. 
BB-8 sees her interest and BEEPS furiously, not liking this conversation at all. 
She looks at Unkar. 
Looks down at BB-8. 
Considers it all. 
Finally, she hears herself say: REY Actually... the droid's not for sale. (TO BB-8) Come on. 
Unkar furious. 
Rey, then BB-8, head out. 
Recovering, Unkar watches her go with dark eyes. 
He picks up a communicator: UNKAR Follow the girl and get that droid. 
He SLAMS the service window door SHUT. INT. STAR DESTROYER HOLDING CELL - DAY The cell door WHOOSHES OPEN -- a STORMTROOPER enters. 
Poe remains shackled, worse for wear. 
A TROOPER GUARD here. 
STORMTROOPER Ren wants the prisoner. 
TIGHT ON POE, in pain, drained, as the Guard unshackles him. 
INT. STAR DESTROYER CORRIDOR - DAY An exhausted, handcuffed Poe is walked down the corridor by the Stormtrooper, who holds a blaster at Poe's body. 
STORMTROOPER Turn here. 
Poe turns into a narrow passageway -- INT. STAR DESTROYER NARROW PASSAGEWAY - DAY Heading down the narrow hall the Stormtrooper stops Poe. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: STORMTROOPER Listen carefully: you do exactly as I say, I can get you out of here. 
POE (COMING TO) If -- what--? 
The Stormtrooper pulls off his helmet: IT IS FN-2187. 
FN-2187 This is a rescue, I'm helping you escape. 
Can you fly a TIE fighter? 
POE You with the Resistance--?! FN-2187 What? (THAT'S CRAZY) No no no! I'm breaking you out. 
Can you fly a TIE fighter? 
POE I can fly anything. 
Why, why are you helping me? 
FN-2187 Because it's the right thing to do. 
POE (it hits him) You need a pilot. 
FN-2187 I need a pilot. 
And Poe, seeing this is for real, smiles a hero's smile. 
POE We're gonna do this. 
FN-2187 (unsure but hopeful) ... 
Yeah? 
INT. STAR DESTROYER HANGAR - DAY WIDE SHOT ESTABLISHING the hangar. 
Find FN-2187, again masked, walking with Poe. 
By all appearances he's escorting a prisoner. 
A group of OFFICERS passes in the opposite direction. 
FN-2187 Okay, stay calm, stay calm. 
POE I am calm. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: FN-2187 I'm talking to myself. (BEAT) Not yet. 
Okay, go. 
This way. 
FN-2187 walks quickly toward the far wall -- Poe follows -- up the stairs to a two-man SPECIAL FORCES TIE FIGHTER -- INT. TIE FIGHTER - DAY FN-2187 and Poe (wincing, sore) drop into the back-to-back cockpit. 
FN-2187 pulls off his helmet as Poe removes his cuffs and jacket, fires up the ship with excitement. 
POE I always wanted to fly one of these things. 
Can ya shoot? 
FN-2187 Blasters, I can! POE Okay, same principal! Use the toggle on the left to switch between missiles, cannons, and mag pulse -- use the site on the right to aim, triggers to fire! FN-2187 This is very complicated FWOOOOOOM! The TIE FIGHTER LURCHES FORWARD -- POE I can fix this. 
INT. HANGAR SIX CONTROL ROOM - DAY WIDE: see the ship STRUGGLE TO RISE, CABLES connected to it -- PULL BACK FAST to REVEAL we're inside the main control room. 
STAR DESTROYER TECHNICIAN We have an unsanctioned departure from bay two. 
WHIP TO a FIRST ORDER COLONEL, who responds: FIRST ORDER COLONEL Alert General Hux and stop that fighter. 
INT. STAR DESTROYER HANGAR - DAY The TIE Fighter LIFTS OFF from the bay, rips CHARGING cables! Stormtroopers UNPACK and aim MEGABLASTERS. INT. TIE FIGHTER - DAY FN-2187 opens fire. 
INT. STAR DESTROYER HANGAR - DAY FN-2187 TEARS UP PARKED TIE FIGHTERS and GUN EMPLACEMENTS WITH WELL-AIMED, STRATEGIC LASER BLASTS! Hits the CONTROL ROOM! INT. HANGAR SIX CONTROL ROOM - DAY THE WINDOWS ARE BLOWN IN BY LASER BLASTS! INT. TIE FIGHTER COCKPIT - DAY POE I got it! EXT. STAR DESTROYER - DAY The TIE Fighter blasts from the ship -- INT. TIE FIGHTER - DAY Poe pilots -- amazed, almost enjoying it. 
POE Woooahhh! This thing really moves. 
All right, we gotta take out as many cannons as we can or we're not gonna get very far! FN-2187 All right! POE I'm gonna get us in position, just stay sharp! EXT. STAR DESTROYER - DAY The TIE Fighter ARCS BACK, DIVES THROUGH THE OPENING BETWEEN THE LEVELS OF THE MASSIVE SHIP, then FLIES DOWN AND BACK, along the ship's belly -- INT. TIE FIGHTER - DAY Poe flies toward the CANONS -- POE Up ahead! Up ahead! You see it? 
I've got us dead centered. 
It's a clean shot. 
FN-2187 Okay, got it. 
FN-2187 gets a target, FIRES! EXT. STAR DESTROYER - DAY LASERS BLAST from the TIE Fighter -- A SERIES OF CANNONS EXPLODE! Our TIE Fighter SLICES THROUGH the debris! INT. TIE FIGHTER - DAY FN-2187 YELLS in celebration: FN-2187 YES! You see that?! DID YOU SEE THAT? POE I saw it! Hey, what's your name? 
FN-2187 FN-2187! Poe reacts, this tells him volumes about FN-2187's history. 
POE FN-whaa? 
FN-2187 That's the only name they ever gave me! POE Well I ain't using it! FN, huh? 
Finn. 
I'm gonna call you Finn! That all right? 
Even in the madness, Finn can't suppress his smile. 
FINN "Finn." Yeah, "Finn", I like that! I like that! POE I'm Poe. 
Poe Dameron. 
FINN Good to meet you, Poe! POE Good to meet you too, Finn! INT. STAR DESTROYER MAIN BRIDGE - DAY General Hux looks over the shoulder of LIEUTENANT MITAKA, at a console. 
LIEUTENANT MITAKA Sir, they've taken out our turbolasers-- GENERAL HUX Use the ventral cannons. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: LIEUTENANT MITAKA Yes, sir. 
Bringing them online -- KYLO REN (O.S.) General Hux. 
Is it the Resistance pilot? 
Hux turns: Kylo Ren enters fast, looms large, angry. 
GENERAL HUX Yes, and he had help. (VEXED) From one of our own. 
PUSH IN ON REN as Hux says: GENERAL HUX (CONT'D) We're checking the registers now to identify which Stormtrooper it was. 
KYLO REN ... 
The one from the village. 
FN- 2187. 
Hux is unnerved that Ren knows -- he chalks it up to Ren's Force ability. 
Kylo Ren heads off. 
LIEUTENANT MITAKA Sir. 
Ventral cannons hot. 
GENERAL HUX Fire. 
EXT. STAR DESTROYER - DAY Massive WARHEAD LAUNCHERS SPIN and FIRE BLASTS toward the TIE fighter, which flies EVASIVE MANEUVERS -- most blasts hit the DEBRIS from the TURBOLASER DESTRUCTION. The TIE fighter then PULLS A BIG TURN, BACK TOWARD JAKKU, THE SANDY PLANET WHERE POE LEFT BB-8. 
INT. TIE FIGHTER - DAY POE One's coming towards you. 
My right, your left. 
Do you see it? 
FINN Hold on! I see it! POE Nice shot. 
Finn looks up suddenly in alarm -- FINN Where are you going? (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: POE We're going back to Jakku. 
That's where. 
FINN No no no! We can't go back to Jakku! We need to get outta this system! NEAR-MISS LASER BLASTS as Poe pilots aggressively. 
POE I got to get to my droid before the First Order does! FINN What - a droid?! POE That's right. 
He's a BB unit! Orange and white: one of a kind. 
FINN I don't care what color he is! No droid can be that important! POE This one is, pal. 
FINN We need to get as far away from the First Order as we can! We go back to Jakku, we die! POE That droid's got a map that leads straight to Luke Skywalker! FINN Oh, you gotta be kidding me!!! I-- Suddenly BAM! THEY ARE HIT! EXT. TIE FIGHTER - DAY The TIE FIGHTER SPARKS AND SMOKES, SPIRALING out of control toward the surface of Jakku! INT. STAR DESTROYER MAIN BRIDGE - DAY Captain Phasma and General Hux stand before a holographic projection detailing FN-2187's service records. 
CAPTAIN PHASMA FN-2187 reported to my division, was evaluated and sent to Reconditioning. 
GENERAL HUX No prior signs of non-conformity? (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: CAPTAIN PHASMA This was his first offense. 
A technician checks her readings, reports to General Hux. 
TECHNICIAN #1 General. 
They've been hit. 
GENERAL HUX Destroyed? 
TECHNICIAN #1 (GETTING READINGS) Disabled. 
They were headed back to Jakku -- the fighter's projected to crash in the Goazon badlands. 
GENERAL HUX They were going back for the droid -- send a squad to the wreckage. 
EXT. JAKKU DESERT - DAY TIGHT ON FINN'S FACE: His EYES OPEN. He goes from unconscious to terrified, fast. 
He sits up, looks around. 
CUT BACK WIDE: he sits in the middle of an EPIC DESERT, DUNES FOREVER. A BLACK CHUTE blows in the wind behind him, scattered debris. 
Then he sees, over distant dunes, RISING BLACK SMOKE. He gets up -- moves toward it, calling out: FINN Poe! Poe! Finn scrambles over the massive dune to the TIE FIGHTER, SMOKING AND ON FIRE, small debris around it. 
He thinks he sees POE'S ARM -- he pulls on it, but it's JUST POE'S JACKET. He throws that off and tries to find a way in -- even a way to LOOK INSIDE, but the smoke and heat make it impossible. 
FINN (CONT'D) Poe!!! POE! Suddenly the ship BEGINS TO SINK -- like it's being CONSUMED INTO QUICKSAND -- Finn is slipping in too -- FINN (CONT'D) POE!!! POE!!! It becomes clear fast: if Finn doesn't get away, he's gonna get sucked in too! So Finn scampers away from the TIE FIGHTER as it SINKS INTO THE SAND! We're in the Sinking Fields. 
A few moments and IT'S GONE. Finn's out of breath. 
Horrified. 
Then A GIANT EXPLOSION ERUPTS FROM below, SENDING SAND AND DEBRIS EVERYWHERE! Finn sees this, disoriented, scared, exhausted and defeated. 
And all alone. 
EXT. DESERT - DAY ENDLESS DUNES BEHIND HIM, Finn walks, removing pieces of his Stormtrooper gear, using Poe's FLIGHT JACKET for shade. 
EXT. DESERT - DAY Exhausted, Finn continues his trek across the endless, sandy nothingness. 
EXT. DESERT - DAY Finn, parched and losing hope, he walks to the edge of a massive dune, looks out into the epic valley below. 
Miles ahead: NIIMA OUTPOST. INT. STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE - DAY General Hux and Kylo Ren walk the length of the bridge. 
GENERAL HUX Supreme Leader Snoke was explicit. 
Capture the droid if we can, but destroy it if we must. 
KYLO REN How capable are your soldiers, General? 
GENERAL HUX (WITH VITRIOL) I won't have you question my methods. 
KYLO REN They're obviously skilled at committing high treason. 
Perhaps Leader Snoke should consider using a clone army. 
GENERAL HUX (YOU SON-OF-A-BITCH) My men are exceptionally trained -- programmed from birth-- KYLO REN Then they should have no problem retrieving the droid. 
Unharmed. 
GENERAL HUX Careful, Ren. 
That your "personal interests" not interfere with orders from Leader Snoke. 
KYLO REN I want that map. 
For your sake, I suggest you get it. 
Ren heads off. 
Hux hates him. 
EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY Sun-scorched and exhausted, Finn stumbles out of the desert into the Outpost. 
In a heatstroke daze he moves past enormous old SHIP PARTS, MERCHANTS, SCAVENGERS and TENTED STALLS. FINN Water... water... water.. 
He sees a WATER TROUGH where a filthy, slobbering hippo-like creature (a HAPPABORE) DRINKS. Finn moves to it, uses his hands to desperately DRINK the filthy water. 
After a couple swallows he SPITS IT OUT, disgusted. 
FINN (CONT'D) -- Awgh, GAH! But he's parched and immediately RETURNS FOR MORE. ACROSS THE MARKETPLACE, REY kneels with an emphatically BEEPING BB-8. 
Just then, TWO of UNKAR'S THUGS approach and stop her. 
One clearly tells her that they're taking the droid. 
BB-8 reacts nervously as Rey resists them -- one pulls a SACK over BB-8 while the other grabs Rey's arm -- in the tussle, Rey KNOCKS OVER METAL URNS for sale -- Finn, still drinking, is PUSHED OVER by the happabore. 
He falls to the ground, then turns to look when he HEARS CRASHING. He sees, through the tents, REY FIGHTING. He moves UP CLOSER to help this young woman being accosted -- but he STOPS when Rey begins to FIGHT BACK -- scrappy and feral, she KICKS, BITES and HITS. Finn is taken aback as she DEFEATS the attackers, who hit the sand, hard. 
Finn just watches, stunned. 
Rey moves to the COVERED BB-8 -- PULLS THE SACK OFF OF HIM. Finn cannot believe his eyes. 
IT'S POE'S DROID! Rey talks to BB-8, who, nervous now, looks around and... 
SEES FINN! BB-8 STARTS BEEPING like crazy. 
Then something insane happens: REY LOOKS AT FINN. REY (To BB-8) Who? 
Him? 
Finn is confused. 
Rey stands, staring at Finn, defiant. 
Finn can feel trouble coming -- and Rey begins CHARGING AT HIM, quarterstaff in hand. 
Realizing he's the target, Finn begins to RUN -- away from her, through the tent marketplace. 
Rey goes after him -- he turns a corner -- then another -- then BAM! She's got ahead of him and SLAMS HIM TO THE GROUND WITH HER STAFF! Finn is on his back, out of breath and freaked out. 
She holds the staff on him threateningly: REY What's your hurry, thief? 
FINN What--?! Thief? 
BB-8 ROLLS UP FAST, MOVES TO FINN -- a WELDING ARM TELESCOPES FROM HIS BODY AND SHOCKS FINN! FINN (CONT'D) OW! HEY! What?! REY The jacket! This droid says you stole it! FINN I've had a pretty messed up day, alright?! So I'd appreciate it you stop accusing me -- OW!!! (BB-8 has ZAPPED him AGAIN) STOP IT! REY Where'd you get it? 
It belongs to his master. 
Finn looks at her -- then the agitated droid, Finn's mind racing. 
He puts it all together. 
Frustrated, but sighs heavily, needing to respond somehow. 
So he makes a hard decision: to tell the truth. 
FINN It belonged to Poe Dameron. 
That was his name, right? 
Rey and BB-8 react, surprised and wanting more. 
FINN (CONT'D) He was captured... by the First Order! I helped him escape but our ship crashed. (RELIVING IT) Poe didn't make it. (sees BB-8 is sad, ROLLS OFF) Look, I tried to help him. 
I'm sorry... 
BB-8 heads off to the side, depressed. 
Rey watches BB-8, then considers Finn again. 
Says, a bit impressed: REY So you're with the Resistance? (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: Finn's mind races again. 
He makes an easy decision: to lie. 
FINN Obviously. 
Yes. 
I am. 
I'm with the Resistance, yeah. (WHISPERS) I'm with the Resistance. 
Rey lowers her staff, Finn stands. 
Rey studies him: REY I've never met a Resistance fighter before. 
FINN Well, this is what we look like. 
Some of us. 
Others look different. 
REY BB-8 says he's on a secret mission, he has to get back to your base. 
FINN Apparently he's carrying a map that leads to Luke Skywalker, and everyone's after it. 
She turns to him, concerned, curious. 
And asks: REY Luke Skywalker? 
I thought he was a myth. 
Just then BB-8 BEEPS MADLY at something he sees. 
REY (CONT'D) What is it? 
Rey moves to him, peeks around a tent corner. 
Now Finn moves to see: at a distance, TWO STORMTROOPERS TALKING TO UNKAR'S THUGS -- who POINT THEIR WAY! Finn urgently grabs her hand and heads for the tents: REY (CONT'D) (re: her hand) What are you doing?! FINN Come on! Suddenly LASER BLASTS RIP PAST THEM, HIT THE CLEANING UNIT, SPEWING STEAM! Rey SCREAMS -- MORE BLASTS as they run! EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY Finn and Rey holding hands, the three race, ZIGZAGGING through a maze of tents: (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: FINN Come on, BB-8! REY Let go of me! FINN No, we gotta move! REY (pulls her hand back) I know how to run without you holding my hand! BB-8 stay close! This way! Now Finn and BB-8 follow Rey -- ANOTHER BLAST just missing them! They disappear through a tent. 
TRACK FAST WITH STORMTROOPERS, through the tent maze. 
They come out of a tent, HAVING MOMENTARILY LOST THEIR TARGET. STORMTROOPER Call in the air strike! REY, FINN AND BB-8 duck into another tent: INT. NIIMA OUTPOST - TENT - DAY Rey, Finn and BB-8 move through RUSTY WARES and take cover. 
Quiet, urgent: REY They're shooting at both of us! FINN Yeah, they saw you with me! You're marked! REY Well, thanks for that! FINN I'm not the one who chased you down with a stick! Does anyone have blasters around here?! REY (TO BB-8) Are you okay? 
Finn QUIETS HER WITH A GESTURE, HEARING SOMETHING. PUSH IN ON FINN -- whatever he hears alarms him greatly -- he GRABS HER HAND AGAIN -- PULLS HER AWAY -- REY (CONT'D) Stop taking my hand! EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - TENT - DAY Finn pulls Rey from the tent -- BB-8 FOLLOWS -- As they race from the tent a TIE FIGHTER SCREAMS INTO VIEW FROM BEHIND THE TENTS! A SECOND FOLLOWS CLOSE BEHIND. IT FIRES AT THEM -- A MASSIVE BLAST SENDS REY AND FINN FLYING -- BB-8 ROLLING! WIDE SHOT: TWO TIE FIGHTERS SCREAM OVER the town, the EXPLOSION throws sand and debris fifty feet into the air. 
Rey is thrown HARD to the ground -- she is rattled, truly afraid. 
Then she turns: FINN lies nearby, unconscious. 
Suddenly afraid, she scrambles to him, rolls him over. 
BB-8 ROLLS OVER, BEEPING in concern. 
REY Hey! As Finn comes to, he sees her. 
Through his fog: FINN -- Are you okay? 
And that very question touches her -- having never in her life been asked it. 
REY Yeah. (extends her hand) Follow me. 
Grateful, Finn takes it. 
They're off. 
LOCALS run amok as TIE fighters DIVE BOMB. REY, Finn and BB- 8 SPRINT, BLASTER EXPLOSIONS GET CLOSER AND CLOSER! EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - SPACEPORT - DAY Rey, STAFF strapped to her back, leads the way as she, Finn and BB-8 race into the spaceport. 
Finn glances back: TWO TIE FIGHTERS BANK their return. 
They YELL: FINN We can't outrun them! Rey POINTS to a parked, four-engine SHIP ahead: REY We might in that quad-jumper! FINN We need a pilot! REY We've got one! (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: FINN You?! (then, indicates one OFF-CAMERA) What about that ship? 
REY That one's garbage! They run for the JUMPER but the passing TIE FIGHTERS FIRE AT IT, BLOWING IT APART IN A HUGE FLAME BALL! Rey, coming to a quick stop, RIGHT UP TO CAMERA: REY (CONT'D) The garbage'll do! She turns and runs back -- Finn and BB-8 follow as they all run toward the piece of junk -- and we see it for the first time: THE MILLENNIUM FALCON! TIE fighters BANK AROUND AGAIN. Finn, Rey and BB-8 run up the ramp of the semi-tarped Falcon. 
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY Finn, Rey and BB-8 enter the ship -- she hits a control and the door DESCENDS CLOSED as she races to the cockpit: REY Gunner position's down there! FINN (CLIMBS DOWN) Y'ever fly this thing? 
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY Rey tosses her staff aside, jumps into the pilot's seat, frantically flips switches. 
BB-8 rolls in behind her as the ENGINES WHINE to life: REY No! This ship hasn't been flown in years! INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNNER POSITION - DAY Finn buckles into the gunner seat -- to his shock the SEAT WHIPS TO THE LEFT, startling him -- he grabs the controls to steady himself. 
FINN Great. (reacts to seat) Whoa! I can do this, I can do this-- INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY Rey bucks herself up. 
Doesn't believe her quick words: (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: REY I can do this, I can do this-- Rey pulls the yoke: THE FALCON ENGINES LIGHT UP BRIGHT! EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - SPACEPORT - DAY The FALCON RISES, WILDLY -- ITS TARPS FLY OFF -- THE SHIP SPINS AND TILTS, SLAMS INTO AND CRUMBLES THE TOWN'S ARCHWAY! From the tents, Unkar Plutt runs out, SCREAMS: UNKAR HEY!!!! THAT'S MIIIIIIINE!!! The Falcon BLASTS AWAY, two TIE FIGHTERS chase it, fast! INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY Rey pilots, headed for the sky! Finn SWINGS into frame, trying to work the GUNS. FINN Whoa! Hey! Oh! Stay low! Stay low! REY WHAT? FINN Stay low! It confuses their tracking! For a crazy instant Rey LETS GO OF THE YOKE, stretches to the co-pilot controls -- THE FALCON CANTS! REY BB-8, hold on! Rey finally REACHES the switches, returns to the yoke, stabilizing the ship, afraid of this next move. 
REY I'M GOING LOW!!! EXT. DESERT - DAY BEHIND THE FALCON as it DRAMATICALLY BANKS AT AN UPWARD ARC, UPSIDE-DOWN, then SWOOPS PERILOUSLY LOW across the sand. 
Two TIE FIGHTERS SCREAM past us! INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY In the cylindrical corridor, BB-8 ROLLS TO THE CEILING! Rey looks back for a flash as the TIE Fighters pass -- They are ROCKED BY A BLAST! (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: REY What are you doing back there? 
Are you ever gonna fire back?! Finn flicks switches -- The GUN TARGETING LIGHTS UP: FINN I'm working on it! Are the shields up? 
Rey strains, reaching for something in the co-pilot seat. 
REY Not so easy without a co-pilot! Finn struggles with the gun controls and SWEEPING CHAIR: FINN Try sitting in this thing! Finn finally FIRES BACK at the two TIE FIGHTERS! EXT. DESERT - DAY Finn's shots MISS. The TIE FIGHTERS ARC BACK IN PURSUIT and SCREAM PAST US toward the Falcon! Both TIES FIRING! INT. TIE FIGHTER COCKPIT - DAY The BLACK-SUITED PILOT FIRES at the Falcon. 
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNNER POSITION - DAY The Falcon is ROCKED by another BLAST! FINN We need cover, quick! INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY Rey HITS SWITCHES, pilots the best she can: REY We're about to get some! (TO HERSELF) I hope. 
EXT. DESERT - DAY The Falcon speeds through a ROCK FORMATION, GRAZING THE ROCK, TAKING OUT A CHUNK -- the two TIE Fighters in pursuit, FIRING! The Falcon BANKS SO HARD, the edge of the ship RIPS A LINE IN THE SAND as it turns, REVEALING THE SHIP GRAVEYARD AHEAD. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY BB-8 EXTENDS MAGNETIC CABLES to brace himself in a corridor. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: Finn continues to fire at the TIE fighters, narrowly missing them. 
FINN Damn it! Rey maneuvers the ship deeper into the graveyard. 
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNNER POSITION - DAY Finn SWOOPS into frame, FIRES -- FINN Come on... come on... -- HITS AND SHATTERS the TIE FIGHTER! REY Nice shot! FINN I'm getting pretty good at this! EXT. DESERT - SPACESHIP GRAVEYARD - DAY The TIE FIGHTER CRASHES amid the DEBRIS, THREE SCAVENGERS instantly there to consume the new bounty. 
The Falcon, pursued by the ONE REMAINING TIE FIGHTER, slaloms through the MASSIVE WRECKAGE, GRAZING THE OLD SHIPS as she goes, pieces flying. 
The TIE FIGHTER FIRES -- HITTING THE FALCON'S LOWER TURRET, SPINNING IT, JAMMING IT INTO FORWARD POSITION! INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNNER POSITION - DAY ALARMS BLARE -- FINN The cannon's stuck in forward position, I can't move it! You gotta lose 'em! INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY The ship is HIT AGAIN -- afraid, Rey's mind races as she scans the area -- and gets an idea. 
REY Get ready! FINN Okay! For what? 
EXT. DESERT - SPACESHIP GRAVEYARD - DAY Rey pilots the ship up AND INTO THE REAR OF A CRASHED SUPER STAR DESTROYER! The final TIE FIGHTER FOLLOWS! INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY Finn peers out the window, realizing where they are: FINN ARE WE REALLY DOING THIS?! INT. WRECKED SUPER STAR DESTROYER - DAY The two ships slalom debris inside the giant ship -- the Falcon GRAZING ONE SIDE, THEN THE OTHER, SPITTING SPARKS! INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY Rey, scared, girds herself as she quickly runs out of space in the wreck. 
REY Oh no! Just as the TIE PILOT GETS A LOCK, Rey YANKS THE YOKE -- EXT. DESERT - SPACESHIP GRAVEYARD - DAY The Falcon makes a HARD RIGHT TURN out of the Destroyer. 
Rey then CUTS POWER AND FLIPS THE SHIP SO BACK FACES FRONT! FINN CAN NOW SEE THE PURSUING TIE FIGHTER! He FIRES, DESTROYING IT! REY GUNS THE ENGINES again, FLIPS THE FALCON and FLIES AWAY as the TIE FIGHTER CRASHES! FINN Whooo! The Falcon ROARS OFF, victorious, leaving the ship graveyard and disappearing into the clouds. 
EXT. SPACE - DAY The Falcon ROARS from Jakku off to space. 
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY Rey excitedly unbuckles her seatbelt and hurries back. 
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CORRIDOR - DAY Rey races past BB-8, who is RETRACTING his safety restraints. 
Finn, adrenalized, climbs from the turret, meets Rey in the corridor, the LOUNGE in the b.g.. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: REY FINN Good shooting! Thanks! I-- Now that was some I don't know! -- I've flying! How did you flown some ships but I've do that?! No one never left the planet! trained you? 
No one? 
Your last shot was dead That was amazing! on. 
You got him with one (beat) blast! You set me up for it! (laughs) (cocky) It was perfect! That was pretty good. 
They're just staring at each other now, seeing something odd and weird and wonderful -- two people totally inexperienced in joy and camaraderie. 
Bb-8 BEEPS something urgent -- she turns to the droid, kneels. 
REY (CONT'D) You're ok. 
He's with the Resistance. 
He's going to get you home. 
We both will. (TO FINN) I don't know your name. 
FINN Finn. 
What's yours. 
REY I'm Rey. 
BB-8 looks at him: really? 
Finn is reminded: HE'S LIED TO HER. She looks at Finn with a sweet smile. 
FINN Rey... 
But before Finn can say anything they JUMP: across the lounge, STEAM BURSTS from under the grating. 
REY Help me with this! Quick! They hurry to the grating, PULL IT UP together. 
BB-8 rolls over, watches. 
FINN Whoa! What's going on? 
She goes below as BB-8 BEEPS concern. 
EXT. SPACE - DAY The First Order Star Destroyer above Jakku. 
INT. STAR DESTROYER BRIDGE - DAY Lieutenant Mitaka moves to Ren, who looks out across the star field. 
Mitaka swallows, uneasy with his task. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: LIEUTENANT MITAKA Sir. 
We were unable to acquire the droid on Jakku. 
Ren turns to look at him, he says nothing. 
LIEUTENANT MITAKA (CONT'D) It escaped capture aboard a stolen Corellian YT model freighter. 
KYLO REN The droid... stole a freighter? 
LIEUTENANT MITAKA Not exactly, sir. 
It had help. 
Ren says nothing. 
Which says everything. 
Mitaka sweats. 
LIEUTENANT MITAKA (CONT'D) We have no confirmation, but we believe FN-2187 may have been helped in the escape-- Ren IGNITES HIS LIGHTSABER, TURNS AND SLASHES AT THE CONSOLE BEHIND HIM! HOLD ON Mitaka, who reacts, looks away -- winces. 
The horrible SOUNDS of Ren's rage continues. 
Finally Mitaka looks up. 
The metallic wall behind Ren is RIPPED with glowing scars. 
KYLO REN Anything else? 
Mitaka hates to say the following, but: LIEUTENANT MITAKA The two were accompanied by a girl. 
Ren reaches out -- Mitaka is suddenly, violently PULLED TOWARD REN, into his black glove: KYLO REN What girl? 
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - LOUNGE AREA - DAY Rey's head POPS up from under the grating, surrounded by STEAM. An EMERGENCY ALARM BLARES. REY It's the motivator! Grab me a Harris wrench -- check in there! As he checks a storage box, she disappears down below, overwhelmed by the technical issues -- FINN How bad is it?! (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: REY If we wanna live, not good! BB-8 watches as Finn searches A SELECTION OF TOOLS: FINN They're hunting for us now, we gotta get outta this system! Rey re-emerges, Finn hands her the wrench. 
REY BB-8 said the location of the Resistance Base is "need to know" -- if I'm taking you there, I need to know! FINN (Throws a tool) This? 
She catches it and goes under again, leaving Finn and BB-8 alone. 
He contemplates telling her the truth. 
This is his moment. 
But instead he knees to BB-8, says quietly, urgently: FINN (CONT'D) You gotta tell us where the base is. (BB-8 BEEPS) I don't speak that. 
Alright, between us, I'm not with the Resistance, okay? (BB-8 backs up) -- I'm just trying to get away from the First Order -- but you tell us where your base is, I'll get there first -- deal?! (BB-8 COCKS his head) Droid, please. 
Rey pops up again: REY Pilex driver, hurry! Finn moves for the tool. 
REY (CONT'D) So where's your base? 
FINN (searching, to BB-8) Go on BB-8, tell her. (QUIETLY) Please! She and Finn look to BB-8 -- who considers the whole situation, then BEEPS. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: REY The Ileenium system? 
Finn hands her the tool, surprised but thrilled -- Rey disappears below again. 
FINN Yeah, the Ileenium system, that's the one -- get us there as fast as you can. 
A smiling Finn gives BB-8 a THUMBS UP. BB-8 quickly extends his WELDING TORCH and TURNS IT UPWARD, then retracts it. 
REY I'll drop you two at Ponemah Terminal. 
I need the bonding tape, hurry! FINN (searching for tape) What about you? 
REY I gotta get back to Jakku! FINN (loses his mind) BACK TO JAK--?! Why does everyone always wanna go back to Jakku?! ! REY No, that one! No. No. The one I'm pointing to! No. NO. NO. If we don't patch it up, the propulsion tank will overflow and flood the ship with poisonous gas! Bb-8 has moved to Finn -- TIPS HIS HEAD, shows him the tool. 
He throws her the tape, she disappears below: FINN This? 
REY Yes! FINN Hey. 
Rey. 
You're a pilot -- you can fly anywhere! Why go back?! You got a family? 
You got a boyfriend? 
Cute boyfriend? 
The STEAM and ALARM STOP as Rey pops up, annoyed: REY None of your business, THAT'S WHY! But then: ALL THE SHIP POWER GOES OUT. BB-8 is nervous. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: FINN ... 
That can't be good. 
REY (HEADS OFF) -- No it can't be -- FINN FOLLOWS REY TO: INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY They plop into the seats, in a panic. 
She checks the dead INSTRUMENTATION PANEL: REY Someone's locked onto us -- all controls are overridden. 
Finn quickly, awkwardly climbs up, looks out. 
REY (CONT'D) Get off. 
Get off! See anything? 
FINN ... 
Oh no. 
EXT. SPACE - DAY The Millennium Falcon, powerless, is a sitting duck. 
SOMETHING EPIC appears from ABOVE: THE ANTENNA ARRAY IS THE FIRST WE SEE OF A MASSIVE FREIGHTER, ITS GIANT HANGAR OPEN LIKE A HUGE MOUTH WHICH SWALLOWS THE FALCON LIKE A WHALE! INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY Finn PLOPS into his seat, horrified. 
FINN It's the First Order. 
REY What do we do-- there must be SOMETHING -- Finn's mind races -- then: FINN You said poisonous gas -- REY -- Yeah, but I fixed that -- FINN Can you unfix it? 
Rey stares at him -- and gets his plan! They head off -- INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - LOUNGE AREA - DAY The GAS MASKS hanging in the lounge are GRABBED. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: Finn and Rey, gas masks on, quickly climb into the open grating area. 
REY C'mon BB-8. 
They help BB-8 down, too: they both struggle like crazy, he weighs a TON. FINN I got it. 
REY Oooh... 
FINN I'm okay. 
BB-8 get off me... 
UNDER THE GRATING Finn pulls the grating over them as Rey works on the controls. 
REY You think this'll work on the Stormtroopers? 
FINN Yeah. 
Their masks filter out smoke, not toxins. 
LIGHTS COME ON! SOUND of the SHIP RAMP LOWERING! Finn PULLS THE GRATING CLOSED as he says: FINN (CONT'D) Hurry! REY I'm hurrying! Suddenly the FALCON DOOR OPENS -- AND HAN SOLO AND CHEWBACCA BOARD THE FALCON, weapons at the ready. 
PUSH IN ON THEM, ready for combat, operating silently, with hand signals only. 
HAN Chewie, we're home. 
Han gives Chewie a nod to check out the ship. 
Chewie heads off one way, Han in another. 
The grating above LIFTS OFF -- hands in surrender, they look up at Han, who's training his blaster on them, threatening. 
They're SCARED. HAN (CONT'D) Where are the others? 
Where's the pilot? 
REY ...I'm the pilot... (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: HAN You? 
Chewie MOAN-TALKS. Rey responds to him -- REY No, it's true: we're the only ones on board. 
FINN You can understand that thing? 
HAN And "that thing" can understand you too, so watch it. 
Come on outta there. 
They climb up -- BB-8 uses his magnetic arm to quickly pull himself out. 
HAN (CONT'D) Where'd you get this ship? 
REY Niima Outpost. 
HAN Jakku?! That junkyard? 
FINN Thank you! Junkyard! HAN (TO CHEWIE) Told ya we should've double-checked the Western Reaches! (TO REY) Who had it, Ducain? 
REY I stole it from Unkar Plutt. 
He stole it from the Irving Boys, who stole it from Ducain. 
HAN Who stole it from me! Well, you tell him Han Solo just stole back the Millennium Falcon for good. 
Han walks away, takes in the ship: it's his again. 
Doesn't see that Rey is awed. 
His back to all of them, he smiles. 
Chewie responds as Han heads toward the cockpit. 
REY This is the Millennium Falcon? 
You're Han Solo? (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: HAN I used to be. 
FINN Han Solo? 
The Rebellion General? 
REY No, the smuggler! FINN (TO CHEWIE) Wasn't he a war hero?! Chewie replies: "Yeah, I guess, kinda..." Rey calls out: REY This is the ship that made the Kessel Run in fourteen parsecs...! INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - SAME Han enters the cockpit. 
HAN Twelve! Fourteen. 
A moment of private joy. 
Then he sees something that ANNOYS HIM: HAN (CONT'D) Hey! Some moof-milker put a compressor on the ignition line! Han moves to the corridor. 
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - LOUNGE AREA - DAY REY Unkar Plutt did. 
I thought it was a mistake too, puts too much stress on THE HYPERDRIVE-- HAN (OVERLAPPING HER) -- Stress on the hyperdrive-- (who is she? 
Then:) Chewie, throw 'em in a pod, we'll drop them at the nearest inhabited planet. 
REY Wait! No -- we need your help! HAN My help? 
REY This droid has to get to the Resistance base as soon as possible! (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: FINN He's carrying a map to Luke Skywalker. 
Yup: Han stops in his tracks. 
FINN (CONT'D) You are the Han Solo that fought with the Rebellion. 
You knew him. 
The mention of Luke has really hit Han. 
He turns to Finn. 
HAN Yeah, I knew him. 
I knew Luke. 
Suddenly: a distant, METALLIC KA-CHUNK! HAN (CONT'D) Don't tell me a Rathtar's gotten LOOSE-- Han hurries out -- they all follow, (Chewie, Rey, Finn, then BB-8), Finn with WILD CONCERN: FINN Wait -- a what?! Did you just say Rathtars? 
Hey! INT. CARGO SHIP - HANGAR - DAY The Falcon is parked in this giant freighter's hangar. 
Han moves to a CONTROL PANEL, they all follow him. 
FINN You're not hauling Rathtars on this freighter, are you? 
HAN I'm hauling Rathtars. 
On the CONTROL PANEL: IMAGES ON SCREENS FROM ALL AROUND THE SHIP. Including the EXTERIOR, where a TRANSPORT SHIP is LANDING ON THE FREIGHTER. Han is fearful. 
HAN (CONT'D) Oh great. 
It's the Guavian Death Gang -- they must've tracked us from Nantoon. 
Han heads off as: REY What's a Rathtar? 
INT. CARGO SHIP - CARGO CONTAINER CORRIDOR - DAY Han leads our group down a LONG NARROW HALL lined with cargo containers. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: HAN They're big and dangerous... 
FINN Y'ever heard of the Trillia Massacre?! REY No. FINN Good. 
They turn a corner: HAN I got three of 'em going to King Prana. 
FINN THREE?! How'd you get them on board? 
HAN I used to have a bigger crew. 
Chewie GROAN-TALKS, concurring. 
CUT TO: LOOKING UP AS A HATCH OPENS IN THE FLOOR. HAN AND CO. ARE THERE. HAN Get below deck and stay there until I say so -- don't even think about taking the Falcon. 
REY What about BB-8? 
HAN He stays with me -- until I get rid of the gang, then you can have him back and be on your way. 
FINN What about the Rathtars... where are you keeping them? 
A TERRIFYING BAM: a GROTESQUE RATHTAR GIANT TONGUE SLAMS into the CARGO CONTAINER window behind Finn, whose heart stops. 
HAN There's one. 
REY What are you gonna do? 
HAN Same thing I always do: talk my way out of it. (CHEWIE MOAN-TALKS) Yes, I do. 
Every time. 
INT. CARGO SHIP - NARROW CORRIDOR - DAY A PORTAL opens. 
The GUAVIAN DEATH GANG enters. 
One man in a SUIT (BALA-TIK), and five SECURITY SOLDIERS in badass UNIFORMS with ROUND-FACE HELMETS. They turn into and stop at one end of the corridor. 
Han, Chewie and BB-8 forty feet away in the middle of the long hall. 
BALA-TIK Han Solo. 
You are a dead man. 
Han smiles innocently, friendly. 
BB-8 nervously looks back and forth at the gang, and Han. 
HAN Bala-Tik. 
What's the problem? 
BALA-TIK The problem is we loaned you fifty thousand for this job. 
INTERCUT WITH: INT. CARGO SHIP - BELOW FLOOR GRATING - DAY They look up, trying to get a view. 
REY Can you see them? 
FINN No. They start crawling down the crawl space. 
BALA-TIK I heard you also borrowed fifty thousand from Kanjiklub. 
HAN You know you can't trust those little freaks! How long've we known each other? 
Rey and Finn arrive under the gang. 
They WHISPER: REY They have blasters... 
FINN A lot of 'em. 
We RISE THROUGH THE FLOOR to see the GANG and Han and company in the distance. 
BALA-TIK The question is how much longer will we know each other? 
Not long. 
We want our money back now. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: HAN Ya think hunting Rathtars is cheap? 
I spent that money. 
BALA-TIK Kanjiklub wants their investment back, too. 
HAN I never made a deal with Kanjiklub! BALA-TIK Tell that to Kanjiklub. 
The SOUND of a PORTAL OPENING. Han's face GOES WHITE as he turns to the OTHER END OF THE CORRIDOR, where KANJIKLUB MEMBERS APPEAR. A GANG in a MEDIEVAL BANDITO style. 
Han smiles uncomfortably at the Kanjiklub members. 
Its LEADER, TASU LEECH, out front. 
Han tries to play it off: HAN Tasu Leech. 
Good to see you. 
Tasu speaks an alien language, we SUBTITLE: TASU LEECH Wrong again, Solo. 
It's over for you. 
Tasu COCKS HIS WEAPON, there for blood. 
BB-8 is nervous. 
Finn and Rey react to the sounds of the new gang -- start CRAWLING BACK the other way to see them. 
HAN Boys. 
You're both gonna get what I promised! Have I ever not delivered for you before? 
BALA-TIK Yeah. 
TASU LEECH Twice! Han realizes he's right. 
HAN What was the second time? 
BALA-TIK Your game is old. 
There's no one in the galaxy left for you to swindle. 
TASU LEECH Nowhere left for you to hide. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: BALA-TIK That BB unit... the First Order is looking for one just like it. 
And two fugitives. 
Finn and Rey SUDDENLY STOP CRAWLING, tense. 
BB-8 hides behind Han's leg. 
PUSH IN ON Han as he realizes: Finn and Rey are in real trouble. 
HAN First I've heard of it. 
Below the grating, Finn and Rey look at each other, afraid. 
Above, another Kanjiklubber (RAZOO QIN-FEE) says (SUBTITLED): RAZOO QIN-FEE Search the freighter. 
One of the Kanjiklubbers begins moving down the corridor, AIMING A FLASHLIGHT DOWN BELOW, searching for: FINN AND REY, in a QUIET PANIC BELOW: THEY START CRAWLING FAST in the opposite direction they came. 
Rey crawls off fast, Finn follows. 
They quickly arrive at a JUNCTION BOX AREA, Rey looking at the controls. 
REY Wait wait wait wait. 
If we close the blast doors in that corridor, we can trap both gangs! FINN Close the blast doors from here? 
REY Resetting the fuses should do it. 
Rey begins RESETTING the FUSES, SPARKS shooting from them as they do. 
Finn quickly joins in. 
Rey and Finn FINISH resetting the fuses boxes. 
Rey smiles optimistically. 
Finn looks hopeful too. 
DOWN AN EMPTY ROW OF LARGE CONTAINERS, which OPEN -- and a GIANT RATHTAR -- an ENORMOUS, FIERCE AND RAVENOUS LAND OCTOPUS -- SLITHERS OUT OF ITS CAGE! BACK UP TOP as BANKS OF LIGHTS BEGIN GOING OFF, ONE BY ONE. The GANGS look around. 
Han's eyes go wide -- he gets it -- and it's bad. 
QUIETLY: HAN ... 
I got a bad feeling about this... 
Suddenly all the LIGHTS COME ON AGAIN -- even down below, where Rey realizes it hasn't gone as planned. 
REY Oh no. 
FINN Oh no, what? 
REY (PALE) Wrong fuses. 
IN ANOTHER CORRIDOR, BACK WITH THE GANGS: BALA-TIK Kill them! And take the droid! The gangs AIM THEIR WEAPONS JUST AS A RATHTAR APPEARS BEHIND THE GUAVIAN DEATH GANG, GRABBING TWO MEMBERS! THE OTHERS SCREAM AND RUN! The gang FIRES BACK -- BLASTS FLY! Han and Chewie react, flinching -- then turn to Kanjiklub as a RATHTAR APPEARS BEHIND THEM, ROARING DEAFENINGLY! The Gang turns -- others run, FIRE AT IT. INT. CARGO SHIP CORRIDOR A - DAY Han, Chewie and BB-8 race down the hall -- A MEMBER OF THE KANJIKLUB GANG comes around the corner. 
Han PUNCHES him with one blow, throws him toward the Rathtar. 
They keep steppin.... 
INT. CARGO SHIP - BELOW FLOOR GRATING - DAY Rey and Finn hurriedly crawl through the space below decks. 
FINN This was a mistake! REY Huge! INT. CARGO SHIP CORRIDOR A - DAY Two Guavian Death Gang members run through the ship -- passing Tasu Leech, who sees another Kanjiklub member down the corridor -- who gets GRABBED BY A TENTACLE! Tasu tries to help him, but he gets PULLED UP AND AWAY! Tasu hears a distant terror-scream of a Rathtar, and runs the other way. 
Other Kanjiklub members YELL at him to avoid that direction -- they all turn a corner -- a RATHTAR IS THERE AND GRABS THE TWO OTHERS! Tasu FIRES at the beast and RUNS OFF -- and we land on a FLOOR HATCH, which opens. 
Rey and Finn climb out, quickly. 
They turn a corridor -- REY What do they look like? (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: Another corner -- and GANG MEMBERS ARE BATTLING A HORRIBLE RATHTAR! Rey COVERS HER MOUTH. FINN They look like that. 
Finn yanks her away. 
They race around another corner -- a RATHTAR IS THERE! FINN (CONT'D) This way! REY Are you sure? 
They scream and run off -- but Finn is GRABBED, PULLED AWAY FAST! REY (CONT'D) FINN! But the Rathtar's fast and TURNS A CORNER, losing Rey -- FINN REY! INT. CARGO SHIP CORRIDOR E - DAY TIGHT ON FINN as he's being yanked down the hall, SCREAMING as he struggles to get loose! Rey turns the corner -- Finn is gone -- nowhere to be seen. 
REY FINN!!!! Without Finn, she is instantly distraught -- then she realizes: SHE'S JUST PASSED A CONTROL PANEL! Her eyes light up as she moves to it: a BANK OF VIDEO MONITORS OF THE SHIP -- and there's Finn, being dragged by a Rathtar toward an OPEN BLAST DOOR. Rey's hand on the button, she waits... then SLAMS THE BUTTON! INT. CARGO SHIP CORRIDOR B - DAY The BLAST DOOR INSTANTLY CLOSES ON ONE OF THE RATHTAR'S TENTACLES! It SCREAMS IN PAIN, ITS SEVERED TENTACLE STILL WRAPPED AROUND FINN'S LEG! Finn scrambles up, desperately shaking the sticky tentacle off his leg! Rey arrives, runs to Finn, beaming to see him alive -- he is adrenaline-rushed, in shock: REY Finn! FINN It had me! But the door--! (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: REY That was lucky! ANOTHER CORRIDOR - Finn and Rey run towards the Falcon. 
INT. CARGO SHIP CORRIDOR D - DAY Han, Chewie and BB-8 take cover, Han exchanging BLASTER FIRE with GANG MEMBERS AT THE OTHER END OF THE HALL. HAN I got the door. 
Cover us! Chewie GROAN-AGREES. Chewie FIRES DOWN THE HALL as Han CROSSES THE CORRIDOR, BB-8 following nervously. 
As Chewie exchanges blaster fire, Han works the controls. 
THE HATCH OPENS (FALCON in the distance) -- just as CHEWIE IS HIT IN THE SHOULDER BY ENEMY FIRE! He goes down with a LOUD GROAN! HAN (CONT'D) Chewie! You okay? 
Han GRABS CHEWIE'S BOWCASTER, FIRES at the DOOR CONTROLS, BADASS! HAN (CONT'D) (looks at bowcaster) Wow. 
Come on! Come on! INT. CARGO SHIP HANGAR - DAY Run with Finn and Rey as they turn into the hangar, toward the Falcon. 
Han helps WOUNDED CHEWIE up the ramp, sees them. 
REY Han! Finn and Rey race past BB-8 -- as they go up the ramp, Han says to Rey: HAN You, close the door behind us! (TO FINN) You take care of Chewie! Han and Rey race up the ramp as Finn heads up with Chewie, who SCREAMS WILDLY IN PAIN! INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY Han stands at the navicomputer, hitting switches. 
Rey enters fast, moves past him to Chewie's seat. 
HAN Hey, where are you going? (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: REY Unkar Plutt installed a fuel pump too -- if we don't prime that we're not going anywhere. 
HAN I hate that guy. 
Han sits as, Rey hitting buttons: REY And you could use a co-pilot. 
HAN I got one, he's back there. 
IN THE LOUNGE, CHEWIE IS IN PAIN -- INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY Han and Rey in the seats: HAN Watch the thrust, we're goin' out of here at lightspeed -- REY (SHOCKED) From inside the hangar? 
Is that even possible? 
HAN I never ask that question until after I've done it. 
A RATHTAR JUMPS ONTO THE WINDSHIELD -- REY SCREAMS! Its GIANT MOUTH CHEWING AT THE GLASS! Han works the controls: HAN (CONT'D) This is not how I thought this day was gonna go -- angle the shields -- Hang on back there! IN THE LOUNGE, Chewie is in pain -- Finn going through a first aid kit -- the ship is HIT again -- FINN (HUGE PROBLEM) No problem! INT. CARGO SHIP - HANGAR - DAY Three GANG MEMBERS race out here and FIRE AT THE FALCON -- hitting FUEL LINES, BLASTING THE SHIP HARD! The ship is hit. 
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY HAN Come on baby, don't let me down! He hits a switch -- but NOTHING. HAN (CONT'D) What?! But Rey reaches over, hits a switch, matter-of-factly. 
REY Compressor. 
Han doesn't like it but she's right -- he hits the switch again and the HYPERDRIVE FIRES! The hangar is FILLED WITH LIGHTSPEED BLAST as the ATTACKING GANG MEMBERS ARE BLASTED BACK LIKE DRY LEAVES. In the cockpit the RATHTAR RIPS AWAY as THE STARS STRETCH LIKE ELASTIC and we CUT TO: EXT. CARGO SHIP - DAY Camera ROTATES as the Falcon DISAPPEARS IN A STREAK, leaving the cargo ship behind. 
INT. CARGO SHIP - DAY PUSH IN on a HANGAR DOOR where Bala-Tik arrives at the window, SEETHING. Makes a CALL: BALA-TIK Inform the First Order that Han Solo has the droid they want. 
And it's aboard the Millennium Falcon. 
EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY A pair of TIE fighters roar towards a magnificent PLANET, frozen WHITE. This is the STARKILLER BASE, a natural planet that has been hacked and modified into something sinister. 
Over this we HEAR a DEEP, almost SOOTHING VOICE. A voice very much in control, of power: SNOKE (V.O.) The droid will soon be delivered to the Resistance... 
INT. STARKILLER PLANET - ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT KYLO REN and General Hux in a dark space, looking UPWARD at someone addressing them. 
We're in a massive and dark ASSEMBLY ROOM. Hundreds of DESKS in a stadium arc, focused on a platform where we see SUPREME LEADER SNOKE. Not entirely human, at nearly twenty-five feet tall. 
All of him a STONY GREY. Old, wounded, fragile and powerful, all at the same time. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: SNOKE ... 
Leading them to the last Jedi. 
If Skywalker returns, the new Jedi will rise. 
GENERAL HUX Supreme Leader, I take full responsibility for th-- SNOKE General! Our strategy must now change. 
GENERAL HUX The weapon. 
It is ready. 
I believe the time has come to use it. 
We shall destroy the government that supports the Resistance, the Republic. 
Without their friends to protect them, the Resistance will be vulnerable, and we will stop them before they reach Skywalker. 
Snoke considers. 
Almost seems to die for a moment. 
Then: SNOKE Go. Oversee preparations. 
GENERAL HUX Yes, Supreme Leader. 
General Hux, proud, cocksure, exits. 
Kylo Ren watches him go. 
Snoke SITS. A new intimacy in his voice. 
SNOKE There's been an awakening. 
Have you felt it? 
KYLO REN Yes. 
SNOKE There's something more. 
The droid we seek is aboard the Millennium Falcon. 
In the hands of your father, Han Solo. 
Kylo Ren reacts with subtle, but real, surprise. 
KYLO REN He means nothing to me. 
SNOKE Even you, master of the Knights of Ren, have never faced such a test. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: KYLO REN (STEELY RESOLVE) By the grace of your training, I will not be seduced. 
SNOKE We shall see. 
We shall see. 
A gentle, satisfied nod from Snoke, and Kylo Ren, obsessed, filled up, exits. 
Snoke watches him disappear, a grotesque evil SMILE growing -- as he DISINTEGRATES -- Snoke has been a HOLOGRAM all along. 
EXT. LIGHTSPEED SPACE - DAY RACING with the Falcon through the STRINGLIGHT of lightspeed. 
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY CHAOS: INTERCUT between the COCKPIT where Han and Rey pilot, ALARMS SOUNDING, problems everywhere, and the LOUNGE where CHEWIE YELPS as Finn nervously works to BANDAGE HIS SHOULDER. SPARKS! HAN Electrical overload! REY I can fix that! HAN The coolant's leaking! REY Try transferring auxiliary power to the secondary tank-- HAN -- Secondary tank, I got it! INT. LOUNGE: CHEWIE HOWLS IN PAIN! Finn hangs in there, wraps a bandage on Chewie's shoulder: Chewie ROARS. BB-8 scurries off. 
FINN Chewie, come on! I need help with this giant hairy thing! Stop moving! Chewie! INT. FALCON COCKPIT: HAN You hurt Chewie, you're gonna deal with me! INT. LOUNGE: As Finn struggles to bandage the Wookiee: FINN Hurt him?! He almost killed me six times! (Chewie GRABS HIM by the collar, ROARS) Which is fine. 
INT. FALCON COCKPIT: HAN This hyperdrive blows there's gonna be pieces of us in three different systems. 
Han at the controls when all the alarms STOP. Rey, satisfied, sits in the co-pilot seat. 
Han is confused. 
HAN (CONT'D) What'd you do? 
REY I by-passed the compressor. 
He looks at her. 
A little, appreciative laugh. 
Han exits, walking past BB-8. 
HAN Move, Ball. 
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - LOUNGE AREA - DAY Han kneels at Chewie, who lies awake but recovering. 
Han checks his friend's wound with care. 
Chewie MOAN-TALKS. HAN Nah, don't say that, you did great. 
Just rest. 
Han turns to Finn, who sits at the HOLOCHESS set, BB-8 beside him. 
This is awkward for Han, but damn, he means it: HAN (CONT'D) Good job, kid. 
And thanks. 
FINN You're welcome. 
Finn has accidentally hit a button on the chess set, and the PIECES appear, looking up at Finn, curiously. 
The pieces start to FIGHT as Finn fiddles with the controls, trying to turn it off. 
HAN So, fugitives, huh? 
REY The First Order wants the map. (MORE) (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: REY (CONT'D) (re: Finn and BB-8) Finn is with the Resistance... (SHRUGS) ... 
I'm just a scavenger. 
Han gives Finn a skeptical once-over as Finn finally manages to TURN THE CHESS SET OFF as Rey enters. 
Han looks to BB-8. 
HAN Let's see whatcha got. 
REY (TO BB-8) Go ahead. 
BB-8 rolls forward -- and suddenly PROJECTS A HOLOGRAPHIC MAP, FILLING THE ROOM. PLANETS, STARS, SYSTEMS. They all react. 
Chewie sits to look up. 
Han moves through stars, becomes reflective. 
HAN This map's not complete. 
It's just a piece. 
Ever since Luke disappeared, people have been looking for him. 
REY Why'd he leave? 
HAN He was training a new generation of Jedi. 
One boy, an apprentice turned against him, destroyed it all. 
Luke felt responsible... 
He walked away from everything. 
FINN Do you know what happened to him? 
HAN There're a lot of rumors. 
Stories. 
The people who knew him the best think he went looking for the first Jedi temple. 
REY The Jedi were real? 
HAN I used to wonder that myself. 
Thought it was a bunch of mumbo-jumbo -- magical power holding together good, evil, the dark side and the light. (BEAT) 'Crazy thing is, it's true. 
The Force, the Jedi, all of it. 
It's all true. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: An alarm rings on the control station, prompting Han to toggle some switches. 
BB-8 cuts off the hologram. 
Chewie rises and moans to Han, but Han motions for Chewie to lay back DOWN: HAN (CONT'D) No, you rest. (To Rey and Finn) You want my help? 
You're getting it. 
Gonna see an old friend. 
She'll get your droid home. 
This is our stop. 
Han leaves towards the cockpit, Rey and Finn following. 
EXT. LIGHTSPEED TO SPACE - DAY BEHIND THE FALCON as it DROPS OUT OF LIGHTSPEED, revealing a BEAUTIFUL GREEN PLANET ahead, TAKODANA. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY Han pilots. 
Finn and BB-8 beside him, Rey as co-pilot. 
Han notices Rey looking out the windshield, almost in tears. 
REY (QUIETLY) ... 
I didn't know there was this much green in the whole galaxy... 
Han watches her -- sees a vulnerability that touches him. 
EXT. TAKODANA PLANET - DAY The Falcon CRESTS OVER an ENDLESS GREEN FOREST TO REVEAL a CASTLE on a picturesque LAKE. The Falcon lands near the castle, among dozens of WORN, smallish freighters. 
EXT. LANDING PAD - NEAR MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY Rey steps off the Falcon, UP TO CAMERA, BB-8 at her side. 
She takes in the towering stone CASTLE, FOREST to one side, LAKE to the other. 
Serene, beautiful, all new to her. 
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - LOUNGE AREA - DAY From BLACKNESS: a storage unit opens. 
Han rummages, retrieving old BLASTERS. Finn arrives behind him, concerned. 
FINN Hey, Solo -- I'm not sure what we're walking into here -- HAN D'you just call me "Solo"? (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: FINN Sorry. 
Han-- Mr. Solo. 
You should know, I'm a big deal in the Resistance. 
Which puts a real target on my back. 
Are there any conspirators here? 
First Order sympathizers? 
HAN Listen big deal, you've got another problem. 
Women always figure out the truth. 
Hands him a BLASTER. HAN (CONT'D) Always. 
Han walks off. 
Finn watches him go, wracked with guilt. 
EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY Han hands Rey a blaster pistol as she stands at looks at the castle. 
HAN You might need this. 
REY I think I can handle myself. 
HAN I know you do. 
That's why I'm giving it to you. 
Take it. 
Rey picks it up. 
Grips it. 
HAN (CONT'D) You know how to use one of these? 
REY Yeah, you pull the trigger. 
HAN There's a little bit more to it than that. 
You got a lot to learn. 
You got a name? 
REY Rey. 
HAN Rey. 
I've been thinkin' about bringing on some more crew, Rey. 
A second mate. 
Someone to help out. 
Someone who can keep up with Chewie and me, appreciates the Falcon. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: REY Are you offering me a job? 
HAN I wouldn't be nice to you. 
It doesn't pay much. 
REY You're offering me a job. 
HAN I'm thinking about it. 
Rey wants to say yes. 
But something stops her. 
A line she can't cross. 
HAN (CONT'D) Well? 
REY If you were, I'd be flattered. 
But I have to get home. 
Han looks at her, questioningly. 
HAN Jakku? 
Rey looks off, in thought. 
Yeah, Jakku. 
REY (BEAT) I've already been away too long. 
HAN (TO CHEWIE) Chewie, check out the ship as best you can. 
HAN (CONT'D) It's too bad. 
Chewie kind of likes you. 
Han heads off. 
HOLD on Rey. 
EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY Han walks them to the castle. 
FINN Solo, why are we here again? 
HAN To get your droid on a clean ship. 
REY Clean? (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: HAN Do you think it was luck that Chewie and I found the Falcon? 
If we can find it on our scanners, the First Order's not far behind. 
Want to get BB-8 to the Resistance? 
Maz Kanata is our best bet. 
FINN We can trust her, right? 
HAN Relax, kid. 
She's run this watering hole for a thousand years. 
Maz is a bit of an acquired taste, so let me do the talking. 
And whatever you do, don't stare... 
REY AND FINN At what? 
HAN Any of it. 
The door opens. 
Music. 
Madness. 
And... 
INT. MAZ'S CASTLE - MAIN ROOM - DAY We ENTER THE LOUD, CROWDED MESS of a hall -- PUSHING PAST a room full of rough and odd ALIENS AND HUMANS, who gamble, drink, scheme, negotiate, argue -- until we end up on the BACK of a tiny, thousand year-old, four foot tall ALIEN, who suddenly STARTS, as if SENSING something -- the Alien TURNS TO US: she is FEMALE, wearing large ADJUSTABLE GOGGLES. This is MAZ KANATA. MAZ Han Solo! Everyone turns to look. 
It's ALL QUIET in here. 
HAN (Sotto) Oh boy. (Louder, waving) Hey, Maz! NOISE returns. 
Maz walks to them, pushes someone away. 
MAZ Where's my boyfriend? 
HAN Chewie's working on the Falcon. 
MAZ I like that Wookiee. 
I assume you need something. 
Desperately. 
Let's get to it. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: Maz walks off, gesturing for them to follow. 
Finn and Rey are confused. 
Han indicates for them to follow. 
They do -- passing the enormous GRUMMGAR, who sits with vixen BAZINE NETAL, who watches them suspiciously. 
A SMALL DROID (GA-97), who turns its head to see BB-8 following Rey across the room. 
GA-97, now animated, makes a small TRANSMITTING SOUND, which is subtitled. 
GA-97 Alert the Resistance. 
Their missing droid is here! And we CUT TO: IN A DARK ALCOVE - MOMENTS LATER Bazine enters a shadowy space, stealthily makes a call on a communicator. 
Clearly, BAZINE IS A SPY. Subtitled: BAZINE Inform the First Order... 
I've found the droid. 
EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY A massive Star Destroyer hovers over the hacked ice planet. 
INT. STAR DESTROYER - KYLO REN'S CHAMBERS - DAY A dark space. 
Kylo Ren, CLOSE TO CAMERA, addresses someone OFF-CAMERA whom we do not see. 
KYLO REN Forgive me. 
I feel it again. 
The pull to the light. 
Supreme Leader senses it. 
Show me again, the power of the darkness, and I will let nothing stand in our way. 
Show me, Grandfather, and I will finish what you started. 
As his emotion builds, he stands and heads off -- we FOLLOW HIM, PIVOTING TO REVEAL who he was talking to: THE BURNT, ASHEN, GHOSTLY DEFORMED MASK OF DARTH VADER. CUT TO: INT. MAZ'S CASTLE - TABLE - DAY Maz is putting together some FOOD as she says: MAZ A map to Skywalker himself? 
You're right back in the mess. 
HAN Maz, I need you to get this droid to Leia. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: MAZ Hmm. 
No. You've been running away from this fight for too long. 
Han, nyakee nago wadda. 
Go home! HAN Leia doesn't want to see me. 
FINN Please, we came here for your help. 
REY What fight? 
MAZ The only fight: against the dark side. 
Through the ages, I've seen evil take many forms. 
The Sith. 
The Empire. 
Today, it is the First Order. 
Their shadow is spreading across the galaxy. 
We must face them. 
Fight them. 
All of us. 
FINN There is no fight against the First Order! Not one we can win. 
Look around. 
There's no chance we haven't been recognized already. 
I bet you the First Order is on their way right-- Finn stops, seeing Maz adjusting her goggles, scrutinizing him -- her eyes get HUGE. FINN (CONT'D) What's this? 
What are you doing? 
Maz adjusts the goggles again. 
Her eyes get impossibly BIGGER. She grunts recognition. 
She hoists herself on the tabletop, knocking over food and plates, crawling towards Finn. 
FINN (CONT'D) Solo, what is she doing? 
HAN I don't know, but it ain't good. 
MAZ If you live long enough you see the same eyes in different people. 
I'm looking at the eyes of a man who wants to run. 
FINN (eyes on Maz) You don't know a thing about me. 
Where I'm from. 
What I've seen. (MORE) (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: FINN (CONT'D) You don't know the First Order like I do. 
They'll slaughter us. 
We all need to run. 
Rey is stunned. 
Maz, not so much. 
She crawls back to her chair. 
She points to some pirates in the corner. 
MAZ You see those two? 
They'll trade work for transportation to the Outer Rim. 
There, you can disappear. 
Finn sees them. 
Considers. 
REY Finn! FINN Come with me. 
REY What about BB-8? 
We're not done yet. 
We have to get him back to your base. 
FINN I can't. 
Finn stands to leave. 
He offers the gun back to Han. 
HAN Keep it, kid. 
Finn heads off. 
Rey gets up to follow. 
Maz dials her lenses back to normal, and turns to Han. 
MAZ Who's the girl? 
ON FINN Who has arrived at the table with the ALIEN SMUGGLERS. FINN I was told you could get me to the Outer Rim. 
Rey barges into the conversation, interrupting. 
REY What are you doing? 
Finn gets up to talk to her. 
FINN (to Big Head) Don't leave without me. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: Embarrassed, Finn moves her away. 
REY You can't just go. 
I won't let you. 
FINN I'm not who you think I am. 
REY Finn, what are you talking about? 
FINN I'm not Resistance. 
I'm not a hero. 
I'm a Stormtrooper. (STOPS HER) Like all of them, I was taken from a family I'll never know. 
And raised to do one thing... (EMOTIONAL) But my first battle, I made a choice. 
I wasn't going to kill for them. 
So I ran. 
FINN (CONT'D) Right into you. 
And you looked at me like no one ever had. 
I was ashamed of what I was. 
But I'm done with the First Order. 
I'm never going back. 
Rey, come with me. 
REY Don't go. 
FINN Take care of yourself. 
Please. 
Rey looks at him, crushed. 
With quiet resignation, Rey watches Finn return to the aliens... 
And all three head off. 
He gets to the front door and walks through it. 
Rey is heartsick, but she turns as she hears the sound of a young girl in anguish, crying. 
She follows the sound into the castle, turning so she can't see that Finn has looked back at her one last time. 
INT. MAZ' CASTLE - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY Rey steps down into the basement corridor. 
BB-8 follows her. 
Walking carefully and confused, she is not sure why she's down here. 
She can hear the echoing sounds of a young girl crying. 
She heads down the hall... to the very end, where there is a door. 
It is almost as if a SOULFUL VIBRATION draws her closer. 
She looks at the door lock -- AND THE DOOR OPENS. Hesitant, Rey enters. 
INT. MAZ'S CASTLE - CRYPT ROOM - DAY Rey moves into the dark, small, vaulted storage room. 
Old treasures line the floors and walls, but there is something specific Rey is drawn to: on a table, an old wooden BOX. She moves to it, unsure, afraid, as if an energy from inside the box has been calling her here. 
BB-8 nervously follows. 
Rey reaches out, very slowly, to touch the box. 
A moment heavy with tension. 
Rey OPENS THE BOX and sees inside Luke Skywalker's original lightsaber. 
With hesitation, she reaches towards it, but she cannot resist. 
As her hand makes contact with it, there is the piercing sound of a lightsaber igniting. 
She moves her hand away, as REY HEARS A MECHANICAL BREATHING sound. 
The CAMERA MOVES, LIGHTING CHANGES -- and we see behind her something impossible: a HALLWAY OF FROM DEEP INSIDE CLOUD CITY. Disembodied voices fill the air. 
YOUNG GIRL NO! She stands -- looks around, confused by all she sees and hears. -- Turns and sees, through a DOORWAY. We follow Rey and she runs down the corridor, but it all TILTS -- TURNS -- and she lands on the WALL -- which is now the GROUND -- dried GRASS. She turns to look -- we PIVOT -- and see a BURNING TEMPLE AT NIGHT. We PAN to: R2-D2 -- who watches the flames -- and a MAN appears (LUKE, whose face we do not see). 
He falls to his knees, reaches out to the droid -- with a MECHANICAL RIGHT HAND. We PUSH IN ON REY as RAIN BEGINS -- and DAY TURNS TO NIGHT -- and she LOOKS UP -- we TILT UP -- To see we're LOOKING UP AT A WARRIOR as he is STABBED BY A FIERY LIGHTSABER! He screams and falls to the ground -- we FOLLOW HIM, revealing Rey again, now in a nighttime battlefield. 
She gets to her feet, frightened by what she sees. 
We PIVOT AROUND HER to REVEAL KYLO REN, and the six other KNIGHTS OF REN, who flank him! Come back around to Rey, soaking now, as the RAIN STOPS and SUNLIGHT illuminates her -- she turns to look -- we PIVOT -- and see... 
A little girl. 
Rey as a child. 
She is sobbing, hysterical. 
Unkar Plutt's meaty hand holds her thin arm. 
She is on Jakku, watching a starship fly into the sky, abandoning her. 
YOUNG GIRL No, come back! (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: UNKAR PLUTT Quiet, girl! The ship flies towards the desert sun, which is strangely eclipsed, as if being eaten by darkness. 
Rey looks around her to see she is.. 
In a NIGHTTIME, BARREN, SNOWY WOODS. She's losing her mind, confounded and lost and she gets to her feet, her breath seen in the frigid air -- and then: THE SOUND OF CLASHING LIGHTSABERS! She moves through the woods, toward the sound. 
Rey runs, heart pounding, when KYLO REN EMERGES FROM BEHIND A TREE! She stops, SCREAMS, FALLS BACK and LANDS IN: INT. MAZ' CASTLE - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY She falls back, out of the room, suddenly sitting in the hall, out of breath, alarmed and perplexed. 
She HEARS something and turns to look. 
Maz stands at the end of the corridor, realizing what has just happened. 
REY What was that? 
I shouldn't have gone in there. 
MAZ That lightsaber was Luke's. 
And his father's before him and now, it calls to you! Rey stands, fast. 
Still overwhelmed, emotional, speechless. 
REY I have to get back to Jakku. 
MAZ Han told me. (reaches out, hold REY'S HAND) Dear child. 
I see your eyes. 
You already know the truth. 
Whomever you're waiting for on Jakku, they're never coming back. 
But... there's someone who still could. 
REY Luke. 
MAZ The belonging you seek is not behind you. 
It is ahead. 
I am no Jedi, but I know the Force. 
It moves through and surrounds every living thing. 
Close your eyes. 
Feel it. (MORE) (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: MAZ (CONT'D) The light. 
It's always been there. 
It will guide you. 
The saber. 
Take it. 
Rey suddenly stands. 
REY I'm never touching that again. 
I don't want any part of this. 
And Rey runs off, passing Maz. 
Rey's mind is spinning -- she can't take it -- she turns and heads off, fast. 
BB-8 follows her. 
TIGHT ON MAZ, watching her go. 
Maz SIGHS, feeling for the young girl. 
EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY Rey exits the castle, needs to run, but doesn't know where. 
Heads toward the woods. 
EXT. FOREST - DAY Rey moves through the foliage, heart racing. 
Over this, we HEAR a RUMBLING -- intense, an OMEN of something horrible to come. 
EXT. STARKILLER BASE - ASSEMBLY AREA - DAY A massive rally: a thousand STORMTROOPERS, TIE FIGHTERS, OFFICERS and VEHICLES. BRUTALIST STRUCTURES, mountainous SNOWY LANDSCAPE. Addressing them at a podium, flanked by RED FIRST ORDER BANNERS, is HUX. His voice ECHOES: GENERAL HUX Today is the end of the Republic! The end of a regime that acquiesces to disorder! At this very moment, in a system far from here the New Republic LIES to the GALAXY while secretly supporting the treachery of the loathsome Resistance. 
This fierce machine which you have built, upon which we stand, will bring an end to the Senate! To their cherished fleet! All remaining systems will bow to the First Order! And will remember this... as the last day of the Republic! INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - DAY ENGINEERS perform FINAL FIRING PROTOCOL. There's a sense of nervousness -- WILL THIS MASSIVE WEAPON ACTUALLY WORK? EXT. STARKILLER BASE - ASSEMBLY AREA - DAY GENERAL HUX FIRE! And Hux TURNS to give the signal as we CUT BACK WIDE -- a ROAR OF BOOTS ON PAVEMENT as the thousand Stormtroopers TURN to face an endless snowy landscape. 
WHAT IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN?! EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY A view PAST THE RALLY. For a moment, nothing. 
Then, eerily SILENT, AN IMPOSSIBLE BLAST OF FIRE LIGHT -- LIKE AN ATOMIC BOMB TEST TIMES A ZILLION -- BLASTS FROM MILES AWAY, INTO THE SKY! Seconds later, a TERRIBLE EXPLOSIVE ROAR! The Troopers -- everyone -- is nearly PUSHED BACK by the FORCE of it -- the magnitude! Many have to COVER THEIR EYES! For MILES around the FIREBEAM, ICE AND SNOW MELTS INSTANTLY! Runoff tunnels FLOODED with AN OCEAN OF FRESH WATER. AIRBORNE CREATURES by the thousands burst from trees and take flight. 
Hux watches, his eyes WILD WITH POWER AND EVIL. From HIS eyes, CUT TO: INT. STAR DESTROYER BRIDGE - DAY TIGHT ON KYLO REN as he watches the Starkiller firing. 
EXT. MAZ' CASTLE - DAY Finn boards the Alien Freighter. 
The SOUND FROM THE SKY makes him turn back. 
He sees the PATH OF FIRE and his blood runs cold, his heart sinks. 
EXT. REPUBLIC SYSTEM - NIGHT At a massive distance we see PLANETS THE REPUBLIC CAPITAL SYSTEM -- INCREASINGLY LIT, THEN POWERFULLY HIT BY THE VAST FIREBLAST WHICH OBLITERATES IT ALL! EXT. REPUBLIC CITY - NIGHT The galaxy CENTER OF GOVERNMENT at NIGHT. Impressive structures. 
Senators and dignitaries look in uncomprehending horror to the night sky. 
LIGHT GROWING -- FROM A GREAT DISTANCE a CIRCLE OF FIRE -- LIKE A SMALL SUN APPEARING FROM NOWHERE AND GROWING CLOSE AND MASSIVE, TURNING NIGHT TO DAY! And in seconds THE FIRE BLOCKS OUT EVERYTHING ELSE, AND THE ENTIRE PLANET OF HOSNIAN PRIME IS INCINERATED! EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY A crowd of ALIENS files out from inside, all eyes on the FIRE IN THE SKY. Dozens of LANGUAGES exclaiming fear and horror. 
Find Han and Chewie moving out, looking up. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: FINN (O.S.) It was the Republic. 
Han and Chewie turn as Finn arrives, moving quickly through the crowd. 
With dread: FINN (CONT'D) The First Order, they've done it. 
Where's Rey? 
EXT. FOREST - DAY Rey races through the forest and finally comes to a stop, overwhelmed and exhausted. 
At an emotional breaking point, she has no idea where to go, who to turn to. 
Then she HEARS A BEEP -- turns to see BB-8, catching up with her. 
REY What are you doing? (HE BEEPS) You have to go back. (he BEEPS again) REY (CONT'D) BB-8. 
No, you can't -- you have to go back, you're too important. 
They'll help you. 
Then, ANOTHER SOUND -- LOUDER NOW -- they LOOK UP AGAIN: in front of the system attack, A FLEET OF FIRST ORDER SHIPS ROAR OVERHEAD, TOWARD THE CASTLE! Rey's heart sinks: HER FRIENDS ARE IN DANGER! INT. MAZ'S CASTLE - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY Maz leads Han, Finn and Chewie down the hall, fast: MAZ I've had this for ages... 
MAZ'S CASTLE - TREASURE ROOM - DAY Maz opens the box -- holds out the lightsaber to Finn: MAZ Kept it locked away. 
HAN Where'd you get that? 
MAZ A good question for another time. (TO FINN) Take it! Find your friend! Finn grabs it as the room is SHAKEN by an above ground attack. 
MAZ (CONT'D) Those beasts! They're here! EXT. FOREST - DAY Rey and BB-8 race fast back toward the castle -- EXPLOSION SOUNDS can be HEARD from the direction they're headed! EXT. FOREST - DAY Rey races through the trees -- sees Maz' castle -- BEING DESTROYED BY FIRST ORDER SHIPS! Aliens RUNNING, GETTING OBLITERATED by SCREAMING TIE FIGHTERS! Other TIE FIGHTERS and TRANSPORTERS LAND, STORMTROOPERS in attack. 
Just then, filtered RADIO CALLS get Rey's attention: nearby STORMTROOPERS have spotted her, AND FIRE! STORMTROOPER FN-417, hold position! Rey takes cover, grabs her BLASTER -- but IT WON'T FIRE! She panics, then realizes: REY Safety! SHE SWITCHES OFF THE SAFETY and FIRES BACK! HITS TWO TROOPERS and retreats, calls to BB-8: BB-8 follows Rey AWAY FROM THE CASTLE, firing back at more chasing Troopers! EXT. MAZ' CASTLE RUINS - DAY Kylo Ren moves through the DEBRIS. A Stormtrooper approaches: STORMTROOPER #4 Sir, the droid was spotted heading west, with a girl. 
Kylo Ren LOOKS BACK SHARPLY, in Rey's direction -- EXT. FOREST - DAY Rey and BB-8 move swiftly, terrified -- she stops them: REY You have to keep going, stay out of sight, I'll try to fight 'em off. (BB-8 BEEPS; bravely through her fear) I hope so, too. 
BB-8 BEEPS and heads off -- Rey RUNS and TAKES COVER behind a massive, mossy tree. 
TIGHT on her TERRIFIED FACE -- EXT. CASTLE DEBRIS - DAY Han, Chewie, Finn and Maz, exhausted, CLIMB UP, peek through debris. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: HAN Come on, Chewie! Maz turns to Finn: MAZ Rey and BB-8, they need you. 
Now go. 
FINN I need a weapon. 
Maz grabs his wrist -- holds up his hand -- THE SABER. MAZ You have one! He looks at her questioningly -- he's supposed to use the lightsaber?! He TURNS IT ON. HAN AND CHEWIE RUN, TAKE COVER from BLASTS, FIRING BACK at Stormtroopers, taking some out! HAN Hey, can I try that? 
Han borrows Chewbacca's bowcaster, fires on Stormtroopers and sends them flying. 
HAN (CONT'D) (TO CHEWBACCA) I like this thing. 
FINN SURPRISES A STORMTROOPER WITH THE LIGHTSABER, then another! Untrained, he's athletic, brave, impressive. 
One Stormtrooper has a MACE -- STORMTROOPER Traitor! FINN and the TROOPER WITH THE MACE battle. 
The Mace Trooper KNOCKS FINN DOWN! The Stormtrooper is about to end him, when THE STORMTROOPER IS SHOT AND FALLS! Wide-eyed Finn sees Han run over, having fired the blast! Han helps him up. 
HAN You okay, Big deal? 
FINN Thanks! But TEN STORMTROOPERS come over a RISE, BLASTERS AIMED. STORMTROOPER Don't move! TK-338, we have targets in custody! (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: No way out, they DROP THEIR WEAPONS: TIGHT on the LIGHTSABER as it HITS THE GROUND. A STORMTROOPER HAND picks it up. 
Han's MIND RACES as a SQUAD OF TROOPERS appears behind them. 
Finn, Han and Chewie are MARCHED by Stormtroopers back toward a transport, hands on their heads. 
But then -- A FAMILIAR ROAR RIPPING ACROSS THE LAKE -- Han turns -- they all do: coming toward them across the water, X- WINGS AND RESISTANCE SPACECRAFT APPEAR, BEGIN FIRING AT THE FIRST ORDER SHIPS! PUSH IN ON HAN, HOPE SURGING -- CHEWIE TALKS. STORMTROOPER (CONT'D) We have incoming at two-eight-point- six! Move! Dispatch! Move! Scramble all squads! Repeat, scramble all squads! Anti-air cover en route to our position! HAN It's the Resistance. 
One X-WING in particular -- MARKED IN BLACK -- SWOOPS DOWN and takes out the parked TIE FIGHTERS and Troopers! INT. POE'S X-WING - DAY It's Poe Dameron at the stick of his X-wing. 
POE Go straight ahead and don't let these dogs scare you! JESS (V.O.) Copy that! SNAP (V.O.) We're with you, Poe! The Stormtroopers around Finn, Han and Chewie SCATTER, TOSSED in EXPLOSIONS! The LIGHTSABER LANDS AGAIN -- FINN PICKS IT UP. HAN Quick! Chewie picks up his Bowcaster, Han takes the blaster. 
Shoots a Trooper. 
FINN Woohoo! YEAH! That's one helluva pilot! INT. POE'S X-WING - DAY POE WOOHOO! EXT. FOREST - DAY In the darkened woods, Rey, terrified, keeps her blaster aimed. 
Her eyes dart around for her pursuer. 
And then: THE UNIQUE SOUND OF KYLO REN'S RASPING LIGHTSABER COMING TO LIFE -- A SOUND she's HEARD BEFORE in the FORCEBACK. Rey's heart skips a beat: she's even more scared now. 
Kylo Ren appears from behind a tree -- Rey FIRES again and again -- Kylo Ren moves toward her, USING HIS LIGHTSABER TO DEFLECT EVERY BLAST. She FIRES ferociously, but Kylo Ren keeps coming! His hand rises -- Rey suddenly STOPS -- GASPS -- UNABLE TO MOVE. KYLO REN The girl I've heard so much about. 
He walks AROUND HER, slowly, she won't let herself cry. 
KYLO REN (CONT'D) The droid. 
He comes around to see her face. 
After a scary beat he WHIPS HIS SABER UP TO HER EYES, ILLUMINATING HER FACE. KYLO REN (CONT'D) Where is it? 
WIDE SHOT: THE EPIC BATTLE BETWEEN RESISTANCE AND FIRST ORDER TROOPS, REFLECTED IN THE STILL LAKE. STORMTROOPER Request air support! EXT. FOREST - DAY Kylo Ren TURNS OFF HIS SABER, reaches up... and REACHES TOWARDS REY'S FACE. She can't move, strains in agony. 
After a beat, surprised by what he finds, he removes his hand. 
She is relieved but still afraid. 
KYLO REN The map. 
You've seen it. 
Rey is horrified. 
He TOUCHES HER FACE again: the pain, tears stream. 
Kylo Ren, taking more from her mind... 
She stares at him, TERRIFIED, straining in agony -- Kylo Ren, mid-interrogation, TURNS TOWARD THE SOUND OF THE EXPLOSIONS. Stormtroopers APPROACH through the woods. 
STORMTROOPER #5 Sir, Resistance fighters! We need more troops. 
Kylo Ren TURNS BACK TO Rey, his hand still on her face. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: KYLO REN Pull the division out. 
Forget the droid. 
We have what we need. 
A GESTURE from Kylo Ren and REY LOSES CONSCIOUSNESS, FALLS FROM FRAME! EXT. CASTLE DEBRIS - DAY The BLACK-MARKED X-WING SWOOPS DOWN again, FIRING, EXPLODING another TIE Fighter! On the ground: STORMTROOPER Pull back the tree line! Han and Chewie dodge debris, FIRING and TAKING OUT TROOPERS. FINN takes out 2 TROOPERS with the blaster, then, out of breath, turns to see: Kylo Ren in the forest, CARRYING REY IN HIS ARMS, INTO HIS SHUTTLE! Finn's heart SHATTERS -- Han stops -- turns -- sees Kylo Ren entering his shuttle. 
Han is ROCKED. FINN NO!! REY!!! Heroically, Finn runs toward the shuttle through LASER BLASTS AND EXPLOSIONS, but the shuttle TAKES OFF -- Finn irrationally CHASES IT, SCREAMS DESPERATELY: FINN (CONT'D) No, no, no, no... 
REY!! In crazed frustration, Finn stops running, watches the receding First Order ships, Rey their captive. 
EXT. FOREST - DAY BB-8 moves fast, then stops and looks up as the First Order ships RETREAT, OFF PLANET. A considered beat, and BB-8 heads BACK FOR THE CASTLE. EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE RUINS - DAY Post battle. 
Finn runs to Han: FINN He took her! Did you see that? 
He took her. 
She's gone! HAN (WALKS PAST) Yeah, yeah, I know... 
And he and Chewie head off. 
EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE RUINS - DAY Han moves toward a RESISTANCE TRANSPORT landing in the debris. 
BB-8 rolls up beside him, in wait for the transport. 
ON HAN'S FACE, knowing exactly what's about to happen. 
Finally, the transport door opens. 
And standing there is LEIA. She sees Han and is stunned. 
A silent beat, husband and wife reunited for the first time in years. 
In the smoke and embers, no one says a word. 
Then C-3PO walks out from the transport, into the field: C-3PO Goodness! Han Solo! It is I, See- Threepio! (sees Han, stops) You probably don't recognize me because of the red arm. (sees Leia, INCREASINGLY AWKWARD) Look who it is! Did you see who? 
Oh. Excuse me, Prin-- uh, General. 
Sorry. 
Come along, BB-8. 
Quickly. (BB-8 BEEPS) Yes, I must get my proper arm reinstalled. 
He hurries off. 
Finally, alone again. 
HAN You changed your hair. 
LEIA Same jacket. 
HAN No, new jacket. 
Chewie glad to see Leia, greets her with a hug. 
Chewie MOANS a few words, looks at Han then boards the ship. 
It is complicated and loving and painful. 
Han says, quietly: HAN (CONT'D) ... 
I saw him. 
Leia, I saw our son. 
He was here. 
Leia hears this. 
Maz watches through the smoke. 
EXT. SPACE - DAY The FALCON and surviving X-WINGS ROAR past camera toward a PLANET WITH GREEN FLORA AND A RING OF ASTEROIDS. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: This is D'QAR. EXT. D'QAR - DAY The SHIPS DESCENDING among grassy mounds and sunken structures. 
EXT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY LARGE GRASS MOUNDS cover HANGARS, beneath the odd, giant trees. 
BOOM DOWN as RESISTANCE GROUND CREW direct an X-WING to a LANDING. In the FOREGROUND, another X-wing canopy OPENS, a PILOT climbs out. 
PAN TO REVEAL the landed Millennium Falcon. 
Finn runs down the ramp, UP TO CAMERA, desperate, searching. 
Then BB-8 SPEEDS RIGHT PAST HIM, almost knocking him down -- Finn watches as BB-8 rolls over to the PILOT GETTING OUT OF THE BLACK-MARKED X-WING. The Pilot's helmet comes off. 
IT IS POE! Finn can't believe what he's seeing. 
And Poe, kneeling in WARM REUNION with BB-8, listens and reacts to something the droid tells him. 
Poe looks up and sees Finn -- and he can't believe it either! Poe smiles, points at Finn. 
From a distance, Finn gestures in sheer amazement that Poe is alive. 
FINN Poe. 
Poe Dameron. 
They move to each other -- and embrace. 
FINN (CONT'D) You're alive! POE So are you! FINN What happened to you? 
POE What happened? 
I got thrown from the crash, woke up at night -- no you, no ship, nothing-- BB-8 BEEPS -- Poe listens, turns to Finn. 
POE (CONT'D) BB-8 says that you saved him. 
FINN No, no, no. 
It wasn't just me. 
POE You completed my mission, Finn. 
That's my jacket? (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: FINN Oh here. 
POE No, no, no. 
Keep it. 
It suits you. 
You're a good man, Finn. 
FINN Poe -- I need your help. 
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY MOVE FAST with Finn and Poe. 
Finn takes in this makeshift command center, buried deep among vines and roots. 
They arrive at Leia, who stands with a group of Resistance Officers, including ADMIRALS ACKBAR and STATURA: POE General Organa. 
Sorry to interrupt, this is Finn, he needs to talk to YOU -- LEIA (takes Finn's hand) And I need to talk to him. 
That was incredibly brave, what you did. 
Renouncing the First Order, saving this man's life -- FINN (surprised she knows) Thank you, ma'am -- but a friend of mine was taken prisoner-- LEIA Han told me about the girl, I'm sorry. 
Finn is startled -- Poe jumps in: POE Finn's familiar with the weapon that destroyed the Hosnian system. 
He worked on the base. 
LEIA We're desperate for anything you can tell us. 
FINN That's where my friend was taken -- I've got to get there, fast. 
LEIA And I will do everything I can to help, but first you must tell us all you know. 
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY Chewbacca sits on a bed in the med bay. 
DR. KALONIA uses a device to help heal his shoulder. 
Chewie TALKS. DR. KALONIA (CHEWIE TALKS) That sounds very scary. (CHEWIE TALKS) You must be so brave. 
Chewie agrees. 
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY C-3PO takes the DATA DEVICE from BB-8 and inserts it into a BASE COMPUTER. THE PROJECTED MAP APPEARS in HOLOGRAM. Leia enters, studying it, dispirited. 
PAN as she moves, REVEALING HAN. C-3PO is here and some others. 
C-3PO General, I regret to inform you, but this map recovered from BB-8 is only partially complete. 
And even worse, it matches no charted system on record. 
We simply do not have enough information to locate Master Luke. 
LEIA I can't believe I was so foolish to think that I could just find Luke and bring him home. 
HAN Leia... 
LEIA Don't do that. 
HAN Do what? 
She heads off. 
LEIA Anything. 
Flummoxed, Han follows looking at C-3PO. C-3PO Princesses. 
Han follows Leia across the base floor: HAN I'm trying to be helpful! (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: LEIA When did that ever help? 
And don't say the Death Star. 
HAN (SIGHS) INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY LOW WITH BB-8 as he rolls over and finds, under a dark and dusty tarp in a corner, R2-D2. BB-8 BEEPS at R2, pulls off the tarp and tries to start a conversation. 
But R2 DOESN'T RESPOND AT ALL. BB-8 tries again. 
Nothing. 
BB-8 NUDGES R2. Nothing. 
Then: C-3PO (O.S.) BB-8. 
You're wasting your time. 
BB-8 looks up at C-3PO, who stands there. 
C-3PO SIGHS. C-3PO (CONT'D) It is very doubtful that R2 would have the rest of the map in his backup data. (BB-8 BEEPS) I am afraid not. 
R2-D2 has been in low power mode ever since Master Luke went away. 
Sadly, he may never be his old self again. 
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY Leia hears the change in Han's voice and softens. 
She turns. 
HAN Listen to me, will you? 
I know every time you... every time you look at me, you're reminded of him. 
LEIA You think I want to forget him? 
I want him back! Han looks at her with sympathy. 
HAN There was nothing we could've done. (hard for him to say) There was too much Vader in him. 
LEIA That's why I wanted him to train with Luke. 
I just never should have sent him away. 
That's when I lost him. 
That's when I lost you both. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: HAN We both had to deal with it in our own way. 
I went back to the only thing I was ever good at. 
LEIA We both did. 
HAN We lost our son, forever. 
LEIA No. (LONG BEAT) It was Snoke. 
Han takes this in. 
LEIA (CONT'D) He seduced our son to the dark side. 
But we can still save him. 
Me. You. 
HAN If Luke couldn't reach him, how could I? 
LEIA Luke is a Jedi... you're his father. 
There's still light in him. 
I know it. 
GENERAL STATURA General, the reconnaissance report on the enemy base is coming. 
INT. STARKILLER BASE - HOLDING CELL - DAY Rey wakes, disoriented. 
She is in an angled, upright restraining rig. 
Looks over, startled to see Kylo Ren, mask in place, standing there. 
REY Where am I? 
KYLO REN (LONG BEAT) You're my guest. 
REY Where are the others? 
KYLO REN You mean the murderers, traitors and thieves you call friends? (Rey stares at him) You'll be relieved to hear that I have no idea. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: Rey studies him. 
She's fearful... but curious. 
KYLO REN (CONT'D) You still want to kill me. 
REY That happens when you're being hunted by a creature in a mask. 
Kylo Ren stops, considers her... then reaches up, unlatches and REMOVES HIS MASK. Rey reacts, stunned. 
It takes a moment before she regains her own mask of defiance. 
KYLO REN Tell me about the droid. 
REY (a nervous beat) He's a BB unit with a selenium drive and a thermal hyperscan vindicator -- KYLO REN He's carrying a section of a navigational chart. 
We have the rest, recovered from archives of the Empire. 
We need the last piece. 
And somehow, you convinced the droid to show it to you. 
You. 
A scavenger -- Rey reacts -- afraid -- how does he know? 
KYLO REN (CONT'D) You know I can take whatever I want. 
Trepidation flashes across Rey's eyes. 
Kylo Ren moves closer, his hand rising toward her. 
She recoils, but has nowhere to go. 
Kylo Ren nearly TOUCHES HER FACE... 
THEY'RE BOTH SURPRISED: they react to a feeling that passes between them -- AN ENERGY THEY RECOGNIZE IN EACH OTHER. And then it's gone. 
Adversaries again. 
Rey can't move, quietly strains in agony, trying to resist Ren's probing. 
KYLO REN (CONT'D) ... 
You're so lonely... so afraid to leave... (then, slight smile) At night, desperate to sleep... you imagine an ocean. 
I see it -- I see the island... 
Tears stream down her face as she resists. 
She tries to break free, but can't budge. 
KYLO REN (CONT'D) And Han Solo. 
You feel like he's the father you never had. 
He would've disappointed you. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: His hand still on her face, her eyes fierce through the agony: REY -- Get out of my head -- But this just makes Kylo lean closer. 
KYLO REN I know you've seen the map. 
It's in there... and now you'll give it to me. 
Don't be afraid. 
I feel it too. 
Where her strength comes from, she doesn't know, but: REY I'm not giving you anything. 
KYLO REN We'll see. 
He peers into her eyes intensely. 
She meets his gaze -- DESPITE THE PAIN SHE IS STRONG. On Ren's face as HIS CONFIDENCE BEGINS TO MELT AWAY. He has slammed up against a barrier in her mind. 
He looks less certain by the moment as Rey seems to GROW IN STRENGTH. The FEROCITY of confrontation builds until it hits critical mass AND REY DOES THE UNTHINKABLE! SHE ENTERS HIS HEAD, AMAZED AT WHAT SHE IS SEEING! REY ... 
You... you're afraid... that you will never be as strong as... 
Darth Vader! KYLO REN SUDDENLY WITHDRAWS HIS HAND, as if her face were FIRE HOT. TAKES A STEP BACK, CONFUSED, RATTLED. Rey's body is released, she breathes deeply, her powerful eyes still on Kylo Ren, who starts to leave. 
And we PRELAP: SNOKE (V.O.) This scavenger, resisted you? 
INT. STARKILLER PLANET - ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT Kylo Ren, mask off, stands before Snoke. 
KYLO REN She's strong with the Force, untrained but, stronger than she knows. 
And while Ren's mind no doubt goes to Luke: SNOKE And the droid? (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: Kylo Ren hesitates to reveal the truth. 
Then: GENERAL HUX (O.S.) Ren believed it was no longer valuable to us. 
Ren turns back -- Hux enters the large space, moves to the platform beside Ren. 
GENERAL HUX (CONT'D) That the girl was all we needed. 
As a result, the droid has most likely been returned to the hands of the enemy. 
They may have the map already. 
Snoke is visibly furious. 
SNOKE Then the Resistance must be destroyed before they get to Skywalker. 
GENERAL HUX We have their location. 
We tracked their reconnaissance ship to the Ileenium system. 
SNOKE Good. 
Then we will crush them once and for all. 
Prepare the weapon. 
Kylo Ren is stunned by the moment -- that isn't what he meant at all -- KYLO REN Supreme Leader. 
I can get the map from the girl. 
I just need your guidance. 
SNOKE If what you say about this girl is true, bring her to me. 
INT. STARKILLER BASE - HOLDING CELL - DAY SLOW PUSH IN ON REY, shackled, mind still racing over what's happened between her and Kylo Ren. 
She is flooded with emotions, feeling her potential, her strength, that in this moment of being restrained, perhaps anything is possible. 
She turns to the Stormtrooper Guard. 
Studies him for an intense beat. 
Then says: REY You will remove these restraints. 
And leave this cell, with the door open. 
The Stormtrooper Guard looks at her. 
A beat. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: TROOPER GUARD #2 What did you say? 
Rey's eyes stay trained on him. 
She shifts in her seat, her confidence wavering, but she repeats, with authority: REY You will remove these restraints. 
And leave this cell, with the door open. 
The Stormtrooper Guard, rifle aimed, MOVES FOR HER. Rey's heart pounds -- is she about to be killed, freed, or laughed at? 
The tension unbearable when the Guard says: TROOPER GUARD #2 I'll tighten those restraints, scavenger scum! INT. STARKILLER BASE - CORRIDOR 1 - DAY LOW ANGLE: Kylo Ren, masked, rounds a corner, PASSES US. INT. STARKILLER BASE - HOLDING CELL - DAY Rey stares intently at the trooper. 
Calms herself. 
And tries again. 
REY You will remove these restraints. 
And leave this cell, with the door open. 
TROOPER GUARD #2 I will remove these restraints. 
And leave this cell, with the door open. 
He reaches down and UNLATCHES THE RESTRAINTS. HE THEN TURNS AND STARTS TO HEAD OUT, her back to him as he exits. 
SHE IS IN SHOCK. Then tries, quickly: REY And you will drop your weapon. 
TROOPER GUARD #2 And I'll drop my weapon. 
The Trooper Guard DROPS HIS WEAPON without turning back -- Rey HEARS the gun fall. 
She's incredulous. 
The guard has LEFT THE CELL, ITS DOOR OPEN. REY, in ABSOLUTE DISBELIEF, MOVES QUICKLY OUT OF FRAME! INT. STARKILLER BASE - HOLDING CELL - DAY Kylo Ren enters the cell -- we PUSH IN ON HIM as he takes in the empty cell -- AND IMMEDIATELY UNDERSTANDS WHAT HAS HAPPENED. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: KYLO REN NO! Enraged, he RIPS OUT HIS SABER and -- EXT. STARKILLER BASE - CORRIDOR 1 - DAY WIDE ANGLE, empty corridor, toward the cell: we only HEAR the horrible SOUNDS. DESTRUCTION. YELLING. A few pieces of red hot DEBRIS BOUNCES into the corridor. 
Two STORMTROOPERS, crossing at the far end of the hall, STOP TO WATCH this display of pure FURY. They retreat, and fast. 
INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - DAY Workers at their controls. 
Vast snowy landscape seen outside. 
Their GAUGES RISE -- THE WEAPON CHARGING SLOWLY -- GENERAL HUX Begin charging the weapon! STARKILLER TECHNICIAN Yes, sir. 
Weapon charging. 
EXT. STARKILLER BASE PLANET - DAY A vast view of the planet -- a MASSIVE SOLARVAC ARRAY surrounds a port TEN MILES IN DIAMETER. MILLIONS OF PANELS turn on the ARRAY -- a wave of BRILLIANT REFLECTIONS. Suddenly, like a planetary-scale TESLA COIL LINE OF ENERGY, THE POWER OF THE SUN begins to TRAVEL DOWN to the Starkiller Base planet. 
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY Finn, now a member of the inner circle of the Resistance, is huddled with the group around the MAP TABLE, which displays a WIREFRAME HOLOGRAM of a ROLLING VIEW OF THE SURFACE OF STARKILLER BASE. With Finn are Han, Leia, Poe, C-3PO, Statura, Ackbar, Brance, SNAP, MAJOR EMATT (60), NIEN NUNB, and others. 
An urgent, messy strategy session -- POE The scan data from Snap's reconnaissance flight confirms Finn's report. 
SNAP They've somehow created a hyper lightspeed weapon built within the planet itself. 
BRANCE A laser cannon? (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: SNAP We're not sure how to describe a weapon of this scale. 
MAJOR EMATT (HORRIBLE MEMORIES) It's another Death Star. 
POE I wish that were the case, Major. 
Poe hits a control. 
A WIREFRAME OF THE DEATH STAR APPEARS. POE (CONT'D) This was the Death Star. 
Poe hits another control -- the Death Star SHRINKS -- AND SHRINKS AND SHRINKS, as the SURFACE AREA OF THE STARKILLER BASE IS DRAWN INTO A LARGER IMAGE, REVEALING THE ENTIRE BASE PLANET. The Death Star is a minuscule SATELLITE in comparison. 
POE (CONT'D) This is Starkiller Base. 
This is news to many here, and they're stunned. 
HAN So it's big. 
ADMIRAL ACKBAR How is it possible to power a weapon of this size? 
FINN It uses the power of the sun. 
As the weapon is charged, the sun is drained until it disappears. 
An OFFICER runs up, hands Leia a DATACARD. LEIA (eyes on datacard) The First Order: they're charging the weapon again, now. (then, heart sinking) Our system is the next target. 
C-3PO Oh my. 
Without the Republic fleet, we're doomed. 
They all react to this horrible news. 
HAN Okay, how do we blow it up? (all eyes on him) There's always a way to do that. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: But no one has anything. 
Leia watches the silence, frustrated. 
Finally, rallying them: LEIA Han's right. 
Han is surprised. 
ADMIRAL STATURA (at first hesitant) In order for that amount of power to be contained, that base would need some kind of thermal oscillator... 
FINN There is one. 
All eyes on Finn as he moves around the hologram to a location on the Starkiller Base -- it is ZOOMED IN: A GIANT BLACK HEXAGONAL STRUCTURE. FINN (CONT'D) Precinct 47. 
Here. 
ADMIRAL STATURA (HYPOTHESIZING) If we can destroy that oscillator, it might de-stabilize the core and cripple the weapon. 
MAJOR EMATT ... 
Maybe the planet. 
Poe then tries to bolster spirits, looking at the BIG HEXAGONAL STRUCTURE: the Oscillator. 
POE We'll go in there and we'll hit that oscillator with everything we got. 
ADMIRAL ACKBAR They have defensive shields that our ships cannot penetrate. 
HAN We disable the shields. (TO FINN) Kid, you worked there, what do you got? 
FINN (beat, then:) I can do it. 
HAN I like this guy. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: FINN I can disable the shields. 
But I have to be there, on the planet-- HAN We'll get you there. 
LEIA Han, how? 
HAN If I told you, you wouldn't like it. 
POE So we disable the shields, take out the oscillator and we blow up their big gun. 
All right. 
Let's go! And everyone splits. 
EXT. HANGARS, RESISTANCE BASE - DAY SERIES OF SHOTS: THE RESISTANCE FLEET PREPARES FOR ITS MISSION. Pilots inspect crafts, including Snap, Nien Nunb, and Poe at his black-marked X-wing. 
Mechanics make adjustments as Crews fuel the jets. 
Ground controllers move ships into takeoff formation. 
Pilots prep their ships, including BB-8, who is PULLED INTO Poe's black X-wing. 
Finn approaches Poe wearing the jacket. 
Poe slaps Finn's shoulder as he heads off. 
Finn watches Poe, despite it all, a little laugh. 
Over this: EXT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY Chewie and Finn follow Han's orders as they prepare the Falcon for one more daring run, maybe its last: HAN Chewie, check that donal capitator. 
Come on. 
Let's go. -- Finn, be careful with those - they're explosives. 
FINN Now you tell me? 
LEIA No matter how much we fought, I've always hated watching you leave. 
Han looks over, there's Leia. 
HAN That's what I did it. 
So you'd miss me. 
She laughs, moves up close to him. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: LEIA I did miss you. 
He looks at her, says sweetly, out of the blue: HAN It wasn't all bad, was it? 
Huh? 
Some of it was...good. 
LEIA ... 
Pretty good. 
HAN Some things never change. 
LEIA (SMILES) True. 
You still drive me crazy. 
Han places his hands on her shoulders. 
It could be thirty years ago. 
They both know there's a good chance he won't make it back. 
They pull each other tight, holding for dear life. 
Quietly, LONGINGLY: LEIA (CONT'D) If you see our son again, bring him home. 
INT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY STORMTROOPER Sir, sensors triggered in hangar 718. 
We're searching the area. 
KYLO REN She's just beginning to test her powers. 
The longer it takes to find her, the more dangerous she becomes. 
Kylo exits. 
INT. STARKILLER BASE - ATRIUM AREA - DAY TIGHT ON REY'S FACE as she peers nervously around a corner. 
Rey runs down a long, glossy hall, taking cover in an alcove, the Trooper Guard's rifle HELD TIGHT. EXT. LIGHTSPEED SPACE - DAY The Falcon SCREAMS PAST -- INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY Flying at LIGHTSPEED, Finn, with Han and Chewie. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: FINN How are we getting in? 
HAN Their shields have a fractional refresh rate. 
Keeps anything traveling slower than lightspeed from getting through. 
Finn is suddenly filled with dread. 
FINN We're gonna make our landing approach at lightspeed?! Chewie, thinking it's crazy too, says: HELL YES WE ARE! HAN Alright, Chewie, get ready. 
Chewie GROANS: he's ready. 
Han studies the PANEL INDICATORS. HAN (CONT'D) And Now! Chewie and Han hit switches -- EXT. LIGHTSPEED SPACE/STARKILLER BASE - DAY The Falcon's ENVIRONMENT SHIFTS INSTANTLY FROM LIGHTSPEED TO PLANET ATMOSPHERE -- it's suddenly FLYING 100 FEET ABOVE THE SNOWY, ROCKY GROUND, HEADED FOR A THICK FOREST! INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY CHEWIE GROANS: HAN I AM PULLING UP!!! EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY But the Falcon has no time -- it PLOWS through the trees! It then RISES -- INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY ALARMS BLARE as the ship SLAMS THROUGH BRANCHES, SHOOTS TOWARD SKY! Han does his best to steer -- Chewie GROANS -- in the madness Han YELLS: HAN I get any higher, they'll see us! And the ship DIVES again, back into the trees! EXT. STARKILLER BASE - CLEARING - DAY A quiet CLEARING on the forest TREELINE. Suddenly the MILLENNIUM FALCON HURTLES OUT OF THE FOREST! From an eruption of BRANCHES and PINE, the ship DIVES -- SLAMS INTO THE SNOW! It DIGS THROUGH A THOUSAND YARDS OF WHITE until it finally comes to a canted stop, half buried in the snow! INT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY OFFICER Sir, she was not found in hangar 718 but all troops are on alert. 
KYLO REN Put every hangar on lock-down. 
She's going to try to steal a ship to-- Suddenly, Kylo senses something. 
Something familiar. 
KYLO REN (CONT'D) Han Solo... 
EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY MASSIVE WIDE SHOT of an EPIC SNOWSCAPE. Han, Finn and Chewie cross the terrain. 
WALKERS appears on the horizon. 
Han, Finn and Chewie take cover behind a base structure. 
Chewie carries a BLACK DUFFEL of EXPLOSIVES. FINN The flooding tunnels are over that ridge. 
We'll get in that way. 
HAN What was your job when you were based here? 
FINN Sanitation. 
HAN Sanitation? 
Then how do you know how to disable the shields? 
FINN I don't. 
I'm just here to get Rey. 
HAN People are counting on us! The galaxy is counting on us--! FINN Solo, we'll figure it out! We'll use the Force! HAN That's not how the Force works--! (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: Chewie MOANTALKS. HAN (CONT'D) Oh really, you're cold? 
FINN Come on! They follow Finn on the snowy hike. 
On the horizon, THE LASER SIPHON SHOOTING INTO THE SKY, SLOWLY SUCKING THE SUN DRY. INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - DAY Technicians at work, the SUN SUCKING seen in the window behind him. 
GENERAL HUX Report. 
FIRST ORDER OFFICER Weapon charged in fifteen minutes, sir. 
INT. STARKILLER BASE - CORRIDOR 4 - DAY A STORMTROOPER waits to board a Transport Compartment. 
The door WHOOSHES open -- HAN, FINN and CHEWIE are there! STORMTROOPER FN-9330 Hey! He fumbles for his blaster but Chewie shoots first. 
WIDE ANGLE of the corridor as the Trooper flies back, dead. 
Chewie drags him out of sight. 
Han and Finn peer around a corner, wary. 
HAN The longer we're here, less luck we're going to have. 
The shields? 
FINN I have an idea about that. 
Han and Chewie follow Finn. 
INT. STARKILLER BASE - CORRIDOR - DAY Captain Phasma heads down a corridor, distant Stormtroopers. 
Suddenly Phasma is T-BONED HARD AND FAST -- SHOVED OUT OF FRAME BY CHEWIE! And now we're in a NARROW CROSS-CORRIDOR, CHEWIE WITH HIS ARMS AROUND PHASMA, FORCED TO FACE FINN, WHO HOLDS HIS BLASTER ON HIS FORMER CAPTAIN. Han stands behind Finn. 
FINN Remember me? (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: CAPTAIN PHASMA FN-2187. 
FINN Not anymore. 
The name's Finn, and I'm in charge. 
I'm in charge now, Phasma. 
I'm in charge. 
HAN Bring it down. 
Bring it down. 
FINN Follow me. 
Finn SMILES as we CUT TO: INT. STARKILLER BASE - ATRIUM AREA - DAY TIGHT ON REY'S FACE as she peers nervously around a corner. 
Rey runs down a long, glossy hall, taking cover in an alcove, the Trooper Guard's rifle HELD TIGHT. From this alcove, she can see down another LONG, PERPENDICULAR WALKWAY -- on one side, a STONE AND STEEL WALL. On the other side, a VAST ATRIUM, with a railing-free DROP OFF, the white pill-light design descending HUNDREDS OF FEET. At the end of this walkway is an OPEN HANGAR DOOR, revealing HUNDREDS OF TIE FIGHTERS parked outside. 
TIGHT on Rey's face as her plan is clear. 
But the problem: between her and the ship she wants to steal, is a GROUP OF STORMTROOPERS. Guards, in conversation. 
As she tries to think about what to do next, we see, FAR BEHIND HER in the perpendicular hall, ANOTHER GROUP OF STORM- and SNOWTROOPERS headed her way! Rey's mind races -- another peek out and she RUNS FAST, across the walkway, and CLIMBS DOWN -- her fingertips disappearing over the edge just as the Troopers approach and continue. 
WIDE SHOT as Rey holds on carefully as the guards walk off, not seeing her over the edge, a death drop below her. 
But then she SEES SOMETHING and has a brainstorm. 
She strenuously cross-climbs to an invisible SERVICE HATCH, which She opens, and climbs INSIDE THE WALL, closing the hatch behind her. 
INT. STARKILLER BASE - INSIDE THE WALLS - DAY A REMARKABLE IMAGE, inside the inner workings of the base. 
Tiny by comparison, Rey climbs amid the incredible infrastructure, a drop to infinity beneath her. 
She is between the LIGHT SOURCE and the WHITE PILL SHAPES, as she makes her way ACROSS. INT. STARKILLER BASE - ATRIUM AREA - DAY WIDE SHOT of the Stormtrooper GUARDS, above the drop off into the atrium. 
What they cannot see is a SHADOWED SILHOUETTE OF REY against the ENDLESS WHITE PILL LIGHTS as she climbs across the space, beneath them, toward her exit! INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ACCESS POINT - DAY CLOSE AS PHASMA SITS INTO FRAME in front of a WORKSTATION -- Finn, Han and Chewie, blasters aimed. 
Phasma reluctantly works controls on the workstation. 
FINN You want me to blast that bucket off your head? 
Lower the shields. 
CAPTAIN PHASMA You're making a big mistake. 
FINN Do it. 
Chewie MOAN/TALKS. Phasma hits a few more buttons -- the controls BEEP-CLICK. "SHIELDS DISABLE INITIATE". Eyes on THE WORKSTATION: FINN (CONT'D) Solo, if this works, we're not going to have a lot of time to find Rey. 
HAN Don't worry kid, we won't leave here without her. 
The controls BEEP-CLICK. "SHIELDS DISABLED". CAPTAIN PHASMA (to Finn, cruel) You can't be so stupid as to think this will be easy. 
My troops will storm this block and kill you all. 
FINN I disagree. 
What do we do with her? 
HAN Is there a garbage chute? 
Trash compactor? 
FINN Yeah, there is... 
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY An ALERT: OFFICERS at their consoles, OVERLAPPING, urgent. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: OFFICER General, their shields are down! C-3PO Thank the Maker! LEIA Han did it! Send them in! ADMIRAL STATURA Give Poe full authorization to attack. 
REAR ADMIRAL GULCH Black Leader, go to sub-lights. 
On your call. 
INT. X-WING - DAY At LIGHTSPEED, Poe pilots: POE Roger, base -- red squad, blue squad, take my lead. 
INT. X-WING - DAY Nien Nunb pilots, acknowledges order in alien language. 
INT. X-WING - DAY Another pilot, ZOLO ZIFF. YOLO ZIFF Dropping out of lightspeed. 
EXT. SPACE/STARKILLER BASE - DAY With CONCUSSIVE BLASTS, the X-WINGS APPEAR and ROAR PAST CAMERA toward the Starkiller Base planet! EXT. STARKILLER BASE - CLEARING - DAY The CRASHED FALCON, two parked TIE FIGHTERS and a TROOP TRANSPORT VEHICLE beside it. 
EXT. STARKILLER BASE - CLEARING - DAY At a distance, the X-WINGS DROP FROM THE SKY, TOWARD THE HEXAGONAL OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE IN THE DISTANCE! EXT. STARKILLER BASE - ABOVE OSCILLATOR - DAY The squad of X-wings DIVE BOMBS the Oscillator, the Black Falcon leads. 
INTERCUT BETWEEN THIS AND VARIOUS X-WINGS. INT. X-WING - DAY POE PILOTS: POE Almost in range! Hit the target dead center, as many runs as we can get! INT. X-WING - DAY Snap pilots. 
SNAP Approaching target. 
INT. X-WING - DAY Nien Nunb acknowledges. 
INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - DAY LARGE EXPLOSIONS atop the DISTANT OSCILLATOR, seen through the large windows! ALARMS BLARE in here -- we PULL BACK as Hux moves quickly to see the damage, he turns sharply to a First Order Officer: GENERAL HUX Dispatch all squadrons... 
COLONEL DATOO Yes, General. 
INT. X-WING - DAY POE Let's light it up! DIVE BOMBING THE OSCILLATOR, HITTING IT DEAD CENTER IN QUICK SUCCESSION! INT. X-WING - DAY LT. BASTIAN Direct hit! ELLO ASTY But no damage! Jess reacts. 
POE Yeah, we gotta keep hitting it! Another bombing run! Remember, when that sun is gone, that weapon will be ready to fire! But as long as there's light, we got a chance. 
INT. X-WING - DAY A BEEPING from BB-8, riding in the back of his X-wing, and Poe looks out -- can't believe what he's seeing: DOZENS OF TIE FIGHTERS! POE Guys, we got a lot of company! INT. STARKILLER BASE - JUNCTION AREA - DAY Finn, Han and Chewie take cover, Chewie pulling some EXPLOSIVES out of the duffel. 
Blast doors nearby. 
FINN We'll use the charges to blow that blast door. 
I'll go in and draw fire, but I'm gonna need cover. 
HAN You sure you're up for this? 
FINN Hell no -- I'll go in find and try to find Rey -- (improvising, fast) -- The troopers'll be on our tail. 
We have to be ready for that. 
There's an access tunnel that'll leads -- (Han starts pointing with his chin to SOMETHING BEHIND FINN) Why are you doing that? 
Why are you doing -- this? 
I'm trying to come up with a plan. 
Finn turns -- AND SEES REY, CLIMBING OUT FROM INSIDE THE WALL, carefully climbing back up to the main level! He can't believe it! Chewie MURMURS his relief. 
Han is maybe more grateful than anyone. 
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY A Resistance Technician turns to Leia: ADMIRAL ACKBAR The Oscillator's still standing. 
OFFICER X-wings coming back for another round of attacks! INT. STARKILLER BASE - CORRIDOR 6 - DAY Rey climbs up to the corridor, vigilant. 
She hears a SOUND, SWOOPS her rifle at -- Finn, Han and Chewie! She cannot believe it! All Finn wants to do is hug her -- and she him. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: HAN Are you all right? 
REY Yeah. 
HAN Good. 
FINN What happened -- did he hurt you? 
REY Finn. 
What are you doing here?! FINN We came back for you. 
She is speechless -- this is all she's ever wanted anyone to do. 
Chewie TALKS -- and Rey's eyes nearly tear up. 
FINN (CONT'D) What'd he say? 
REY (shrugs, smiles, though nearly in tears) ... 
That it was your idea. 
Finn awkwardly smiles. 
It's his nature. 
They embrace. 
REY (CONT'D) Thank you. 
FINN How did you get away? 
REY I can't explain it. 
And you wouldn't believe it. 
HAN Escape now. 
Hug later. 
EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY The X-Wings DOGFIGHT with the TIE Fighters on the surface of the snowy planet. 
INTERCUT BETWEEN the ships SCREAMING past each other, and the COCKPITS of the Resistance and First Order fighters. 
Poe's fighter NEARLY COLLIDES with a close- passing TIE Fighter! SNAP I got one behind me. 
See it? 
JESS Yeah, I'm on it! (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: A heavy cannon emplacement launches a missile that shreds an X-wing fighter. 
JESS Furillo's been hit! SNAP Watch out for ground fire! EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY The X-wings ROAR across the sky, BLASTING and DODGING the TIE Fighters and missiles. 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL Han, Finn, Rey and Chewie, who run out here, into the snow, stopping, eyes on the sky, watching the lop-sided battle. 
THE FOUR HEROES TURN TO EACH OTHER, RESOLVE IN THEIR EYES. A long moment of communication. 
HAN They're in trouble. 
We can't leave. (to Finn, re: Chewie) My friend here has a bag full of explosives. 
Let's use 'em. 
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY A Resistance Technician turns to Leia: KAYDEL KO CONNIX General, are you seeing this? 
VOBER DAND Two more X-wings down. 
That's half our fleet destroyed. 
C-3PO And their weapon will be fully charged in 10 minutes! It would take a miracle to save us now. 
INT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS Han and Chewie arrive here to find THREE SECURITY STORMTROOPERS approaching a Maintenance Hatch. 
Instantly, Chewie takes out the middle one with his Bowcaster. 
Han and the other two Stormtroopers OPEN FIRE, but Han's aim is true. 
ALARMS START BLARING! INT. JUNCTION STATION - NEAR DARKNESS Running inside from a parked snowspeeder, Rey opens a service hatch. 
Finn behind her, as she reaches into the mechanics of the place, very much like the very first shot we saw of Rey. 
And she YANKS a piece of TECH from the machinery and: INT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS The HATCH OPENS! Han and Chewie, having been on the lookout, step inside, weapons poised. 
Chewie MOANS. HAN That girl knows her stuff. 
INT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS Han and Chewie divide the explosives. 
Talk in hushed tones. 
HAN We'll set the charges at every other column. 
He GROAN/TALKS to Han, who looks around, reconsiders. 
HAN (CONT'D) You're right. 
That's a better idea. (checks his detonator) You take the top. (CHEWIE DOES) I'll go down below. 
Detonator. 
We'll meet back here. 
They head off in opposite directions. 
INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS Han finishes placing an explosive. 
Checks he's all-clear and hurries down to the next level. 
Chewie climbs up a level. 
INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - MAIN ENTRANCE - NEAR DARKNESS A SQUAD of Stormtroopers SNAP to alert as Kylo Ren approaches. 
CONTROLS ARE HIT and the huge DOOR OPENS. Without hesitation, Kylo walks INTO THE OSCILLATOR. INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS A COLOSSAL CYLINDRICAL STRUCTURE. DARK CORRIDORS and CATWALKS. Kylo Ren comes to a stop. 
Scans the structure. 
SENSING SOMETHING, he motions the Stormtrooper Squad upwards. 
KYLO REN Find them. 
They rush past him. 
Kylo Ren turns slowly, and HEADS DOWN. INT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS The Stormtroopers move up the ramp, weapons ready, checking carefully where blind corners intersect from the perimeter. 
They come round to the next higher level and PASS CLOSE TO CAMERA. When they've passed, TILT to find CHEWIE, in the shadows of the grillwork. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: Once they're gone, he plants another charge. 
EXT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS The Snowspeeder comes to a stop outside the structure. 
Finn and Rey stop for a moment, look to the sky: THE SUN IS NEARLY GONE. INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - LOWER LEVEL - NIGHT Han finishes setting a charge and is about to move on when he HEARS SOMETHING and conceals himself behind a wide, vertical support. 
He peaks around the edge and his whole demeanor changes -- HAN'S POV: Kylo Ren appears and stops at the railing, looking down into the filter. 
Han looks at his son with a tortured storm of feelings. 
WE'RE WITH KYLO REN as he resumes his hunt. 
He heads directly toward WHERE HAN IS HIDING! Kylo Ren has an INCREASING SENSE OF HAN'S PRESENCE as he moves closer. 
He comes to where Han was hiding -- but HAN IS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN. From his hiding place in a narrow, POWER CHAMBER in the wall, HAN WATCHES HIS SON PASS ONLY A FEW FEET IN FRONT OF HIM. Han SHIFTS HIS POSITION in the tight compartment, so he can watch Ren's progress. 
Kylo Ren turns onto a FLAT BRIDGE THAT BISECTS the open space. 
Unaware of his father, Kylo Ren walks purposefully across to the opposite side. 
Han watches his son walk off -- the CLANK- CLANK of Kylo Ren's boots receding. 
This is Han's opportunity to escape but Leia's words echo through his mind. 
He makes a decision and moves out, to the edge of the catwalk. 
He calls out, strongly: HAN Ben! The name ECHOES as Kylo Ren STOPS, far across the vast catwalk. 
He turns. 
KYLO REN Han Solo. 
I've been waiting for this day for a long time. 
Finn and Rey make their way into the space, opening a HATCH that allows A BEAM OF PRECIOUS SUNLIGHT to stream down like a spotlight on Han and his son. 
Finn and Rey get to a railing and look down. 
They can SEE and HEAR Han and Kylo Ren on the catwalk below. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: HAN Take off that mask. 
You don't need it. 
KYLO REN What do you think you'll see if I do? 
Han moves toward Kylo Ren. 
HAN The face of my son. 
Kylo TAKES OFF HIS MASK. Han is JOLTED -- seeing the face of his son for the first time as a man. 
KYLO REN Your son is gone. 
He was weak and foolish, like his father. 
So I destroyed him. 
HAN That's what Snoke wants you to believe but it's not true. 
My son is alive. 
SEVERAL LEVELS BELOW them, CHEWIE comes to the rail to watch. 
INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - LOWER LEVEL - NEAR DARKNESS Kylo flares. 
KYLO REN No. The Supreme Leader is wise. 
UP ABOVE, Finn, Chewie and Rey watch, rapt. 
Stormtroopers dot the perimeter of the structure, watching the scene. 
ON THE BRIDGE, Han moves closer, stern: HAN Snoke is using you for your power. 
When he gets what he wants, he'll crush you -- you know it's true. 
Kylo hesitates. 
Somehow, he does know it. 
KYLO REN It's too late. 
HAN No it's not. 
Leave here with me. 
Come home. 
We miss you. 
For the first time, Kylo Ren seems truly conflicted. 
Tears flood his stoic eyes... 
KYLO REN I'm being torn apart. 
I want to be free of this pain. 
INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - DARKNESS FALLS Han takes one step toward his son, but stops himself. 
KYLO REN I know what I have to do, but I don't know if I have the strength to do it. 
Will you help me? 
Han hears his son's voice again, pained and vulnerable. 
HAN Yes. 
Anything. 
Kylo Ren unholsters his lightsaber and SLOWLY EXTENDS IT to Han, within a foot of Han's chest. 
Han almost can't believe it. 
The moment seems to last forever. 
And just then, the LAST BEAM OF SUNLIGHT streaming through the open hatch VANISHES. Han actually smiles -- and reaches out for the dark weapon -- but with the light now gone, KYLO REN'S EYES FILL WITH DARKNESS, HE IGNITES THE LIGHTSABER -- THE FIERY BLADE SHOOTS OUT, RIGHT THROUGH HAN'S CHEST AND BACK! KYLO REN Thank you. 
ABOVE, Finn and Rey GASP -- SCREAM -- FINN (PANTING) Solo. 
REY (ALSO PANTING) No, no. 
Han's last moment is looking into his son's face. 
HAN'S KNEES BUCKLE. The blade tilts down with him... until KYLO REN EXTINGUISHES IT AND HAN HOLDS onto the catwalk -- his life slipping away. 
Finally Han FALLS BACK, OFF THE CATWALK, INTO THE DEPTHS OF THE STRUCTURE! INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY Leia, feeling it instantly -- knowing -- drops into a seat, DEVASTATED. INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NIGHT Kylo Ren is somehow WEAKENED by this wicked act. 
Himself horrified. 
His SHOCK is broken only when -- CHEWIE CRIES OUT IN AGONY! Chewie furiously FIRES AT KYLO REN, HITTING HIM IN THE SIDE! Kylo Ren falls back, stunned. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: Our MUSIC TAKES OVER, EPIC AND HEARTBREAKING as Stormtroopers FIRE AT CHEWIE, who is forced to retreat down a corridor, where he holds the EXPLOSIVE REMOTE -- he PUSHES THE BUTTON! Hearing ONLY OUR SCORE, FIRST ONE, then TWO, then FOUR, then SIX EXPLOSIONS rock the structure -- CATWALKS FALL as the walls CAVE IN! Kylo Ren SEES REY AND FINN, WATCHING THE EXPLOSIONS IN SHOCK -- then they SEE KYLO REN, WHO RECOGNIZES THEM BOTH, WITH ASTONISHMENT. He rises to his full height and heads for them with long strides. 
Stormtroopers begin to BLAST AWAY AT REY AND FINN! CRAZED, REY FIRES BACK AS BLASTS HIT AROUND HER. FINN WRAPS AN ARM AROUND HER AND DRAGS/CARRIES HER OUT OF SIGHT! INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY ADMIRAL ACKBAR The Oscillator's been damaged but is still functional. 
COMMODORE META reacts. 
OFFICER TABALA ZO Admiral, their weapon will fire in two minutes. 
EXT. FOREST - NIGHT From a distance the oscillator is ablaze and fractured from the explosives. 
Then Rey and Finn appear, coming over a rising, running into a bare-tree snowy forest. 
FINN The Falcon's this way. 
Finn and Rey, overcome with emotion, race through the snowy forest -- until Finn SLOWS AND STOPS. Rey stops too, both out of breath. 
They look at each other. 
They both know: they can't run. 
EXT. STARKILLER BASE - FOREST - NIGHT Kylo Ren moves through the trees -- until he STOPS. Takes out the saber, ignites it. 
A still figure amidst the gusts of wind and snow. 
STANDING THIRTY FEET AWAY, FACING HIM, ARE FINN AND REY. Finn holds LUKE'S LIGHTSABER, Rey the Stormtrooper BLASTER. KYLO REN We're not done yet. 
REY You're a monster! (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: KYLO REN It's just us now. 
Han Solo can't save you. 
After a beat, Rey moves forward with the blaster -- AIMS IT! Kylo Ren RAISES A HAND -- Rey struggles under his FORCE POWER -- she can't fire -- he strains too, especially with the WOUND Chewie inflicted. 
Kylo Ren GESTURES POWERFULLY -- Rey's BLASTER FLIES OUT OF HER HAND -- another GESTURE and Rey FLIES BACK and SLAMS INTO A TREE thirty feet away! She drops -- LANDS HARD in the snow. 
Dazed, hurt. 
FINN Rey! Rey! Rey... 
Rey... 
Oh no. 
Oh no no no... 
Finn turns to her, afraid and concerned. 
But the SOUND OF KYLO REN'S LIGHTSABER moving makes Finn TURN BACK TO KYLO REN, lit by the glowing YELLOW AND RED BLADE. KYLO REN TRAITOR! In reply, Finn TURNS ON LUKE'S LIGHTSABER -- upon seeing the weapon, Kylo Ren REACTS IN SHOCK. KYLO REN (CONT'D) That lightsaber. 
It belongs to me! FINN Come get it. 
Despite his fear, Finn raises his blade in welcome. 
Kylo Ren CHARGES at him - Finn terrified -- Kylo Ren LUNGES but Finn DEFLECTS Ren's SPARK-SPITTING blade! Kylo Ren TURNS, ATTACKS, CUTS -- amazingly Finn BLOCKS, COUNTER-ATTACKS -- clearly IMPRESSES KYLO REN, who only enjoys this challenge more! Rey RECOVERS, gets her bearings. 
Her eyes focus on the two men fighting, through the trees. 
Kylo Ren is obviously hampered by his wound, yet he attacks with a primal SAVAGERY -- Finn BLOCKS, turning DEFENSIVE moves into OFFENSIVE ones. 
And he ACTUALLY GETS A HIT IN! LUKE'S SABER GRAZING KYLO REN'S ARM! Kylo MOVES BACK -- wounded, but more enraged than weakened. 
Kylo Ren CHARGES AGAIN -- their WEAPONS POUND, SPARKS FLY, their blades LOCK, the men are CLOSE, LIT BY the powerful, CRASHING sabers: And Kylo Ren PUSHES FINN BACK, attacks with pure ferocity -- Finn is stunned -- unprepared for this fierceness. 
Rey sees this -- Kylo Ren unleashes a MERCILESS SERIES OF BLOWS, pushing Finn further and further back until he loses balance. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: That's when KYLO REN STRIKES: HE LANDS A BLOW TO FINN'S TORSO -- LUKE'S LIGHTSABER FLIES FROM FINN'S HAND, THROWN TWENTY FEET! Kylo Ren TURNS OFF HIS LIGHTSABER and REACHES FOR LUKE'S LIGHTSABER -- BECKONING IT WITH THE FORCE. LUKE'S LIGHTSABER VIBRATES IN THE SNOW. Kylo Ren GESTURES, INCREASES HIS POWER -- LUKE'S LIGHTSABER FINALLY FLIES OUT OF THE SNOW, BULLETS TOWARD KYLO REN -- -- AND SPEEDS PAST HIM! KYLO REN TURNS TO SEE LUKE'S LIGHTSABER LAND IN THE HAND OF REY, WHO STANDS, FACING HIM, HAVING REACHED FOR IT HERSELF, BUT UTTERLY STUNNED THAT IT LANDED IN HER HAND! SHE IS SHOCKED -- AND SO IS KYLO REN! Holding it with both hands, SHE IGNITES LUKE'S LIGHTSABER FOR THE FIRST TIME, HER EYES BLAZING. Kylo Ren IGNITES HIS SABER. It's REY who charges now -- Kylo Ren immediately on the defensive. 
They BATTLE POWERFULLY -- He is clearly rocked by her raw, innate skill. 
INT. X-WING - NIGHT NIV LEK We just lost R-1! JESS We're overwhelmed! What do we do? 
It isn't working! Another pilot looks down -- SEES THE EXPLOSION -- coming from the OSCILLATOR. Relatively small, it's an opening: YOLO ZIFF Black Leader, there's a brand new hole in that oscillator. 
Looks like our friends got in! POE Red Four! Red Six! Cover us! LT. BASTIAN I'm on it! ELLO ASTY Roger! POE Everybody else, hit the target hard! Give it everything you got! And the X-WINGS DIVE and BLAST the OSCILLATOR -- EXT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR - NIGHT Another two X-wings -- including Poe's -- soar through the trench leading to the oscillator structure! POE I need some help here! I need some help! LT. BASTIAN I'm coming in! JESS Watch out! ELLO ASTY I'm hit! The alien pilot's X-wing is blasted to pieces. 
POE All teams - I'm going in! Pull up and cover me! NIV LEK Copy that, Black Leader! Good luck, Poe! The trailing X-wings peel off as Poe's black fighter darts into the fiery breach. 
INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - NEAR DARKNESS Outside, the SUN ALMOST COMPLETELY GONE -- PULL BACK THROUGH THE WINDOW TO REVEAL A STARKILLER TECHNICIAN: STARKILLER TECHNICIAN Weapon at full capacity in thirty seconds. 
GENERAL HUX Prepare to fire. 
EXT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR - NIGHT Poe's X-wing weaves through the breach. 
A pursuing TIE fighter does not clear the gap, leaving Poe to circle the interior of the unguarded structure, firing volley after volley of torpedoes. 
EXT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR - NIGHT The remaining X-Wings -- including Poe's -- BLAST the place -- and the structure begins to CRATER, deep underground EXPLOSIONS! EXT. FOREST - NIGHT Amid the BARE WHITE TREES, ONLY TWO LIGHTSABERS -- LUKE'S BLUE AND REN'S YELLOW-RED -- ILLUMINATE the FLURRIES OF SNOW as Rey and Kylo Ren BATTLE HARD. She seems to be, impossibly, STRONGER THAN HE IS for half a dozen blows -- until he FINDS HIS STRENGTH and FIGHTS BACK -- MOVING FORWARD and PUSHING REY BACK, into the forest. 
Suddenly a COLOSSAL CHUNK OF THE FOREST RIGHT BEHIND REY DROPS AWAY! Rey is suddenly fighting on the EDGE OF A MASSIVE, BRAND NEW CLIFF! KYLO REN You need a teacher! I can show you the ways of the Force! REY The Force. 
Rey closes her eyes for a long beat. 
When Rey opens them, she is centered, fortified, and she POUNDS BACK, SINGLE HANDED SWIPES, hitting Ren's gnarly, spitting saber with incredible FORCE. It's so fast now, so furious, that Kylo Ren FALLS BACK -- She ATTACKS HARDER! Ren gets up again but she HITS HIS SABER'S HILT -- HIS BLADE GOES FLYING OFF, TUMBLING INTO THE SNOW -- and she SLASHES AGAIN AND AGAIN AND HITS KYLO REN SQUARE IN THE HEAD AND CHEST. HE GOES DOWN, SUDDENLY A FEARFUL MAN, A LARGE BURN SCAR SLASHED ACROSS HIS FACE! He still reaches for his saber. 
And she could kill him -- right now, with ONE VICIOUS STRIKE! But she stops. 
Realizing she stands on a greater edge than even the cliff -- the edge of the dark side. 
The earth SHAKES. The earth splits. 
A gully forms. 
INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT The area where the RALLY was held is now COLLAPSING into a giant sink hole! We WHIP PAN to a YOUNG TECHNICIAN, who watches this out the control room window in horror. 
He hurries off, passing COLONEL DATOO, who admonishes: COLONEL DATOO Lieutenant, get back to your station! YOUNG TECHNICIAN (stops, fleetingly) Just look. 
We won't survive -- even Hux has gone! As he hurries off, WE HEAR: GENERAL HUX (V.O.) Supreme Leader. 
INT. STARKILLER BASE - ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT Hux stands before SNOKE'S IMAGE. Relative quiet here, but distant SOUNDS OF DESTRUCTION. Hux tries to keep it together but is horrified, heartsick: GENERAL HUX The fuel cells have ruptured. 
The collapse of the planet has begun. 
Snoke takes this in. 
Furious, desolate... knowing. 
SNOKE Leave the base at once and come to me with Kylo Ren. (GRIM) It is time to complete his training. 
EXT. FOREST - NIGHT Rey turns, runs a hundred feet through the forest to: FINN, who lies, near death, not far from where the GROUND FELL AWAY. Rey falls to her knees near him, turns him over, sees his cauterized but possibly fatal wound. 
REY Finn! Finn... 
Tears come to her eyes as she lifts him, holds his lifeless body in her arms. 
Snow flurries around them as she cries, holding this boy who she just met, who she already adores. 
They are left here to die -- nearby MORE TREES DROP as the planet continues to COLLAPSE. And just as it seems like all is lost... 
Her wet eyes look up to see: LIGHTS RISE FROM THE NEWLY-FORMED CANYON -- IT'S A SHIP WE KNOW -- IT'S THE MILLENNIUM FALCON -- and its lights ILLUMINATE REY, WHOSE FACE FILLS WITH HOPE! CHEWIE IS AT THE CONTROLS. He ROARS to them! EXT. FALCON - NIGHT Chewie exits the ship. 
MOMENTS LATER Chewie CARRIES FINN up the ramp. 
Rey hurries with them back into the ship -- INT. FALCON - NIGHT Chewie carries Finn inside, followed by Rey. 
EXT. SPACE - NIGHT And we FLY WITH THE FALCON as it leaves the planet -- we can see CHEWIE AND REY PILOTING, the COLLAPSING PLANET BEHIND US. The Resistance X-wings, led by Poe, follow the Falcon. 
INT. X-WING - NIGHT POE All teams! I got eyes on them! SNAP Yes! The X-wings ROAR OFF, skyward as the MUSIC SOARS, the PLANET IMPLODES -- THE SUNLIGHT IT CONTAINS BURSTS FORTH, and as we get further and further distance from what was Starkiller Base, we witness the REBIRTH OF A SUN. Light restored to a corner of the galaxy. 
The Millennium Falcon and the X-wings RIP THROUGH SPACE, headed home. 
POE Our job's done here. 
Let's go home! EXT. D'QAR - DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT as the Falcon on the landing strip. 
EXT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY The Falcon has landed among the remaining Resistance ships. 
Poe is there, watching as Chewie scuttles down the ramp carrying an unconscious Finn. 
Medical Personnel and Officers, meet them, usher them inside. 
MEDIC Easy, easy. 
He's hurt. 
We've got a heartbeat. 
Rey walks down the ramp and sees, for the first time, Leia. 
C-3PO and BB-8 behind her. 
The crowds are cheering. 
Rey is so sad for Leia, so sorry. 
The two women move for each other. 
And Leia takes Rey's face in her hands. 
Despite her heartbreak, she is grateful. 
She embraces Rey. 
A mother's embrace. 
Rey cries, too, in this emotional first meeting. 
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY Chewbacca sits quietly, as do many in the base, mourning their losses. 
As BB-8 approaches R2-D2, the long dormant droid suddenly stirs. 
The droids beep at each other. 
C-3PO R2-D2! You've come back! You found what? 
How dare you call me that! (MORE) (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: C-3PO (CONT'D) (he swats R2-D2, who CONTINUES BEEPING) Find Master Luke how? 
Come, R2! We must go tell the others at once! INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY Leia stands alone and in silence, heartbroken. 
C-3PO (O.S.) General? 
Excuse me, General? 
Leia turns to see droids. 
C-3PO (CONT'D) R2-D2 may contain some much needed good news. 
LEIA Tell me. 
Rey stands with Leia, Poe C-3PO, BB-8 and a handful of Resistance Officers. 
Suddenly R2-D2 PROJECTS A HOLOGRAM! A LARGE NAVIGATIONAL MAP WITH A SPECIFIC MISSING CHUNK! BB-8 BEEPS -- Poe turns to him -- POE Yeah, all right, buddy, hold on -- Poe runs over -- removes the ancient data device that Lor San Tekka had given him from a base computer. 
He inserts it back inside BB-8, who then PROJECTS HIS MAP -- which he SHRINKS DOWN TO SIZE -- and the two droids MOVE SLIGHTLY -- TOGETHER -- THE TWO HOLOGRAMS UNITE, BB-8'S PIECE FILLING IN R2-D2'S PERFECTLY! Everyone REACTS -- amazed -- C-3PO Oh! The map! It is complete! LEIA (hand on her heart) -- Luke -- Suddenly there are CHEERS AND EMBRACES. C-3PO leans down to R2-D2 and says, quietly, sweetly: C-3PO (to R2-D2) Oh my dear friend. 
How I've missed you. 
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - I.C.U. - DAY A NEW DAY. Finn, unconscious in an I.C.U. 
POD. His fate uncertain. 
Rey sits with him. 
Deeply worried. 
Finally she leans in, close to him. 
She kisses him and says, quietly, despite her fear: REY We'll see each other again. 
I believe that. 
Thank you, my friend. 
EXT. D'QAR - DAY Chewie does last minute checks of the Falcon. 
Rey stands with Leia a beat and then turns to head to the Falcon. 
As Rey walks off, she hears Leia call out: LEIA Rey. 
Rey turns around. 
LEIA (CONT'D) May the Force be with you. 
This fills Rey up. 
She smiles gratefully. 
Rey crosses to the Falcon. 
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY Rey sits in the pilot seat, Chewie as co-pilot. 
Rey looks at him compassionately. 
Rey FLICKS SWITCHES and -- EXT. D'QAR - DAY The Millennium Falcon RISES. Leia, with Poe, BB-8, and C-3PO (with his proper arm replaced), watches the next generation of Jedi begin her journey. 
EXT. SPACE - DAY The Falcon FLIES through space and BLASTS to LIGHTSPEED. EXT. AHCH-TO - DAY A pristine and mighty OCEAN. Endless BLUE, dotted with random, beautiful, mountainous BLACK ROCK ISLANDS, dotted with countless GREEN TREES. The Millennium Falcon FLIES INTO VIEW, BANKS toward one of the ISLANDS. EXT. AHCH-TO ISLAND - DAY Rey, her staff strapped to her back, begins her hike up the considerable mountain, glancing back at Chewie and R2-D2, who watch her from the bottom of the ramp. 
A deep breath and Rey continues her journey. 
EXT. AHCH-TO ISLAND - STONE STAIRS - DAY Built within the rock and foliage of this idyllic island are seemingly endless ANCIENT STONE STEPS. Rey continues to climb them, determined, despite her fatigue. 
EXT. AHCH-TO ISLAND - STONE STRUCTURES - DAY Rey arrives at a clearing. 
Small, modest, primitive stone structures. 
But no one around. 
Rey walks past them, sees, senses no one. 
And then she stops. 
Feels something. 
She turns. 
Standing forty feet away from her, his back to us, is a MAN, in a CLOAK AND ROBE. Rey stares, knowing exactly who it is. 
But she just stares for what seems like forever. 
Until he finally TURNS, SLOWLY, to her. 
Pulls back his hood. 
IT IS LUKE SKYWALKER. Older now, white hair, bearded. 
He looks at Rey. 
A kindness in his eyes, but there's something tortured, too. 
He doesn't need to ask her who she is, or what she is doing here. 
His look says it all. 
In response, Rey pulls something from the pack. 
LUKE'S LIGHTSABER. And she holds it out to him. 
An offer. 
A plea. 
The galaxy's only hope. 
HOLD ON LUKE SKYWALKER'S INCREDIBLE FACE, amazed and conflicted at what he sees, as our MUSIC BUILDS, the promise of an adventure, just beginning... 
THE END
DEAR WHITE PEOPLE Written by Justin Simien REVISED: August 21st, 2013 1 NEWS BROADCAST - VARIOUS SCREENS, VARIOUS PLACES 1 ANCHOR A "race war" has erupted at one of the nation's oldest and most prestigious institutions. 
Glued to this are our story's subjects, who we meet in... 2 A SERIES OF SHOTS 2 TROY FAIRBANKS, 21, Black.

ANCHOR (O.S.) Outrage over an "African American Themed" party organized by predominately white students of Manchester University has resulted in rioting and property damages. 2A KURT FLETCHER, 21, white.

ANCHOR (CONT'D) In an effort to address diversity issues, the school appointed African American scholar Dr. Walter Fairbanks as Dean of Students. 2D LIONEL HIGGINS, 20, Black, watches through dark rimmed 2D glasses in a bustling indifferent Dining Hall. 
A guilt pains his otherwise boyish face. 2. 
ANCHOR (CONT'D) Last year the Dean's office celebrated slight gains in diverse applicants but with many now calling for Fairbanks' resignation, that may have been pre-mature. 2E DEAN WALTER FAIRBANKS, a well adorned Black man in his 2E 50's fights a panic as he watches in a stately office. 
ANCHOR (CONT'D) Up next, a cat that loves to water ski? 
That and more after the break. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS How could this happen? 
TITLE CARD: FIVE WEEKS AGO 3 EXT. MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY - DAY 3 This sprawling impressive mix of Colonial, Gothic and Modern architecture is presented like a living brochure.

ONE BLACK KID stands in the back. 
SAM (V.O.) Dear White People. 
The minimum requirement of Black friends needed to not seem racist has just been raised to two. 4 INT. STUDIO BOOTH - DAY 4 Samantha White (Sam) watches the campus through a one way window with the cool but knowing gaze of someone much older. 
She gets off on sensing and pushing buttons - with a subversive delivery style that boarders on deadpan. 
SUPERIMPOSE: SAMANTHA WHITE, SENIOR, VISUAL AND NEW MEDIA 3. 
SAM (CONT'D) Sorry, but your weed man Tyrone does not count. 
She fades in JAZZ on her control board and leans back to address a box of pamphlet sized books bearing the title "EBONY AND IVY: A SURVIVAL GUIDE." One by one she scribbles her autograph on the books. 5 EXT. ELLINGTON LIBRARY - DAY 5 SERIES OF SHOTS - NATIONALLY RENOWNED STUDENT GROUPS Disheveled caffeinated writers of the MANCHESTER BUGLE. 5A Casual Prepsters shoot us the finger - PASTICHE HUMOR INC. 5A 5B Hopping out of a taxi is Lionel Higgins. 
His sweet but 5B insecure nature as plain as the unkempt fro on his head. 
SUPERIMPOSE: LIONEL HIGGINS, JUNIOR, PHILOSOPHY UNDECLARED STUDENTS shove past him - one even slaps a flyer into his already full hands. 
Lionel's a guppy. 
The kind that gets eaten alive in a tank of sharks. 
As Lionel gets to the door of a large Colonial style home he checks his pockets. 
He's missing something. 
Shit. 
LIONEL (knocking) Kurt! You home? 
Lionel dials on his cell and we hear the PHONE RING from inside. 
Voicemail pops on with a voice other than Lionel's. 
ANSWERING MACHINE Hey boyssss, you've reached Lionel Higginsss, the only bitch on campussss who'll give you a dickssscount. 
That's right hunty, the bigger the dick the less you'll have to pay me to ssssuck it. 
The beep sounds. 
Lionel's in shock. 
Should he hang up? 
Or... 
LIONEL Kurt. 
It's Lionel. 
I'm locked out. 
As Lionel slides down the length of the door into a sit he unfolds the flyer he was just handed. 
It's a rendering of Sam White on a carton of milk with the caption: "MISSING BLACK CULTURE - SAM WHITE TO BRING IT BLACK" 4. 6 EXT. MANCHESTER ROW - DAY 6 Signs scream out "ORIENTATION" as jazz music wafts from the laptops of a group of NEO BEATNIKS. As the music fades... 
SAM (O.S.) Dear White People, apparently Morgan Freeman in "Deep Impact" wasn't enough. 
Despite two terms Obama could cure Cancer and somewhere White folks will be embroiled in protest. 
And he's only half Black. 
GABE, 24, white and ruggedly handsome in spite of his shaggy hair and "laundry day" flip flop clad ensemble, catches the end of this as he passes - grabs his cell phone and dials... 7 INT. STUDIO BOOTH - DAY 7 ...Sam presses a button next to a red light on her controls. 
SAM Talk to me. 
INTERCUT with Gabe walking about on campus. 
GABE What would you say if someone started a Dear Black People? 
SAM (recognizing the voice) No need. 
Mass media from Fox News to reality tv on VH1 makes it clear what white people think of us. 8 EXT. MANCHESTER COURT - DAY 8 SERIES OF SHOTS - POPULAR RESIDENCE HALLS Manchester's white and rich elite before BECHET HOUSE. 8A Athletes of many disciplines before WEBSTER HOUSE. 8A 8B An eclectic group of Black students with some Latinos and 8B a sprinkling of whites before ARMSTRONG / PARKER HOUSE. COCO (V.O.) I'm fucking pissed... 5. 11 INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 11 Colandrea Conners (Coco) trains her unnaturally blue eyes right at us from a Youtube page pulled up on an iPad. 
She's got an entitled air about her. 
Even her cusses sound erudite. 
COCO (YOUTUBE) ...I am! The whole point of randomized housing is to mix shit up. 
I'm out here trying to find the Olivier to my Halle Berry, and they've got me looking like an extra on a Different World... 
The video ends with a click. 
Looking up is HELMUT WEST, a 30's something Black man in dark rimmed glasses and trendy everything. 
Too stylish for this place. 
If he's impressed, it's barely perceptible. 
HELMUT You call your Youtube show "Doing Time at an Ivy League?" He stares right at Coco, there in the flesh. 
COCO In my second year of a four year sentence. 
Wanted to go to New York. 
SUPERIMPOSE: COLANDREA COCO CONNERS, SOPHOMORE, ECONOMICS HELMUT Yeah? 
And do what? 
COCO Things my mama taught me not to. 
You know get in a lot of trouble and become famous for it. 
But alas I didn't get into Tisch... 
HELMUT Armstrong / Parker? 
That your rooming assignment? 
COCO Traditionally it's where the hopelessly Afrocentric gather to process their guilt over not going to an HBCU. (off Helmut's look) Where the Negros be at. 
HELMUT That's not where you want to be? 6. 
COCO Bechet House is more my style. 
HELMUT With the rich white kids. 
COCO Excuse me? 
HELMUT What part of Chicago you from? 
COCO Hyde Park. 
HELMUT What street? 
COCO Seventy Eighth and -- HELMUT -- Seventy Eighth is Southside sweetheart. 
And you know what they say. 
You can take the girl out the hood but -- COCO -- Ain't nothing hood about me. 
HELMUT Thanks so much for coming in. 
Coco gets up to leave. 
Tries to recover. 
COCO So what's this show about anyway? 
HELMUT Here's the way reality works sweetheart, I'm the producer. 
I ask the questions. 
Be in touch. 
And with that Helmut hustles Coco out. 
He sits and ponders before unmuting his iPad. 
SAM (O.S.) Dear White People I am here to burst your post-racial little bubble. (MORE) 7. 
SAM (O.S.) (CONT'D) Yes Oprah may have her own network, but Ann Coulter is still writing best sellers, Black kids are still getting shot for wearing hoodies, and even here the few vestiges of Black culture are under attack by conservative groups, trustees and yes our very own President Fletcher. 
Helmut double checks his app fighting a genuine grin. 
HELMUT This is the school radio? 13 INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER HALL - DAY 13 A pristine pair of Retro Jordans make their way through the halls of Armstrong / Parker where Black students have lively debates, flirt and bump the student radio. 
SAM (O.S.) Dear White People, thanks to the new process of randomizing housing assignments for Sophomores, some of you may be jarred by an assignment to Armstrong/Parker house. 
The owner of the Jordans is revealed as Troy Fairbanks. 
TROY Someone turn that trash off. 
SUPERIMPOSE: TROY FAIRBANKS, SENIOR, POLITICAL SCIENCE Even with his post workout sweat he looks like the cover of Jet. 
Troy exudes "approachable homie" as he spots a small group of WHITE SOPHOMORES who walk timidly down the hall. 
TROY (CONT'D) Newbies right? 
The white sophomores nod their heads yes. 
TROY (CONT'D) Welcome to Armstrong / Parker, home of the dopest dining hall in all of Manchester. 
I'm Troy, Head of House. 
SOPHOMORE What's up my brother? 8. 
SAM (O.S.) When encountering a Black person try and stay calm. 
Don't say things like "what's up" and "my brotha" That's not how you normally talk. 
TROY Ya'll take care. 
Nice Jordan's bro. 
Coco and SOFIA FLETCHER, a dewy-eyed, pink lipped brunette who exudes a kind of sexy boredom saunter down the halls. 
SOFIA Your hair is so cute B. 
T. 
Dubs. 
COCO You're so cute. 
SOFIA Is it weaved? 
Coco's face is a battle between fury and polite surprise. 
SOFIA (CONT'D) I saw "Good Hair" in Afro studies. 
COCO (moving on) Hey what house did you get? 
SOFIA Huh? 
Oh Bechet bitch. 
COCO Of course. 
The mere thought of a Fletcher anywhere else... 
SOFIA Easy, it was the luck of the draw. 
Daddy had nothing to do with it. 
Coco rolls her eyes behind a smile. 
SOFIA (CONT'D) And honestly, if I had to pick anywhere to be it'd be here. 
Sofia eyes the delicious morsels of chocolate boys about. 
COCO I'm down to switch if you are. 
You get your Denzel. 
I get my Gosling. 9. 
SOFIA Oh I got mines. 
Want to meet him? 
They turn the corner to spot Troy greeting more new Sophomores. 
Coco's caught off guard by his looks. 
COCO Cute... (off Sofia's jealous glance) ...for a Black boy. 
Troy sees Sofia and flashes his trademark grin. 
They kiss. 
SOFIA Hey boo. 
This is my friend Coco. 
She's new to the house. 
TROY Hey I'm Troy. 
Welcome to Armstrong / Parker, home of the dopest -- SOFIA -- Are we on duty? 
TROY Head of House is always on duty. 
COCO Nice to meet you. 
I should get settled. 
Thanks Sof! Sofia and Troy smile as Coco turns to go - and continue down the hallway. 
Coco sneaks one last glance at Troy's ass. 
TROY Think I got time for a quick cut? 
SOFIA You got it cut last week. 
TROY It's a Black thing babe. 
SOFIA Since when is OCD a Black thang? 
TROY Don't say "thang" like that. 
SOFIA Besides you've got a shift at the Politicos booth, then a shift at Orientation, then your advisor -- 10. 
TROY -- I'll just wear a hat. 
SOFIA Then a movie maybe? 
Just us? 
TROY Election night. 
Babe, come on. 
Sofia holds her tongue. 
Troy ignores this as he spots... 
TROY (CONT'D) Yo, Kurt my man. 14 DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 14 ...Kurt Fletcher - flanked by guys who share his cynical knowing glare. 
We recognize them from the "Pastiche" portrait from before. 
As they chow down on Mac & Cheese in the Dining Hall - Kurt's glare burns particularly hot towards Troy who waves at him. 
KURT Sis. 
Sofia smiles at her brother Kurt. 
Troy covers the sting of his dismissal. 
They both spot Sam's "Missing: Black culture" flyers. 
TROY Is she kidding with this? 
SOFIA You don't have to run again. 
Just because it's her doesn't mean -- TROY -- I can't let Sam and her wannabe Black Panthers take the House. 
The House needs me. 
This is who I am. 
SOFIA It's who he wants you to be. 
Troy smiles over his irritation. 
This is an old fight. 
TROY Oh so you pick up a Psych class you think you Freud or something? 
Huh? 
SOFIA A Freud reference. 
Sophisticated. 11. 
TROY (seducing) Fine Beck, Jung, Maslow... 
Troy gets a kiss out of her as they pass a booth featuring stacks of Sam's "EBONY & IVY." The booth is manned by REGGIE, 21, Black - his fro top and preppy punk attire is both bohemian and radical. 
Troy glares at Sam's picture on the book. 
It's on. 
There's a history between Sam and Troy. 
Off Reggie's laptop we hear... 
SAM (O.S.) Dear White People, this just in. 
Dating a Black person to piss off your parents is a form of racism. 
Sofia walks off as Troy hears snickers from around him. 
REGGIE Yo Troy I forget. 
Is your major in shucking or was it jiving? 
TROY My major's in Jive. 
Minoring in Shuck. 
You're still majoring in trying to fuck my left overs right? 
Troy walks off as Reggie and Kurt watch him join Sofia. 
SOFIA You need a shower. 15 INT. TROY'S BATHROOM - DAY 15 Water runs while Troy takes a hit of weed from a pipe over the toilet. 
He blows the smoke out an open window through a paper towel tube with a dryer sheet attached to its end. 
He jots something down on a notepad as he whispers... 
TROY You went from ODB to Trey Songz... 16 INT. ARMSTRONG/PARKER DINING HALL - NIGHT 16 The hall is packed with STUDENTS - stylish and mostly Black. 
Helmut West watches from the back. 
TROY Artie, you know your success ratio with the ladies went up like thirty percent after I started edging you up dog, come on. 
You went from ODB to Trey Songz! 12. 
The audience is in STITCHES at this last line. 
Everyone except Sam, Reggie and their crew of afro'd bohemian disciples (who we'll call the BOFROS). Sam records the proceedings with a vintage Super 8 camera. 
REGGIE That's his platform? 
Haircuts? 
SAM Oofta is as Oofta does. 
Coco, sneaks through the door. 
She's got the eyes of Helmut on her. 
What is he doing here? 
As Coco breaks eye contact she sits in the only open spot next to... 
SAM (CONT'D) Just because we're colored don't mean we run on colored people time. 
COCO Boycotting hot combs don't make you an expert on "colored people" boo. 
Coco wafts her silky hair over her shoulders and sits. 
TROY No but seriously, I care about you guys. 
I care about this house. 
We had a great year last year and if it ain't broke... 
Troy basks in his applause. 
Coco eats him up with her eyes. 
Sam doesn't want to get up - her breathing gets heavier. 
REGGIE Just pretend like you're in the booth. 
Just you and the mic. 
SAM Hate this shit. 
As Sam gets up and passes Troy -- TROY You really think you can take this from me? 
SAM Troy we live in a world where there's a Big Momma's House 3. 
I don't have a chance in hell. 
Thank God. 13. 
Sam grabs the mic. 
Her voice shakes before the silent crowd. 
SAM (CONT'D) Troy my brother, it's broke. 
The BoFros cheer and make noise on each line. 
SAM (CONT'D) Troy's a legacy kid. 
And yet it's under his watch that Armstrong / Parker, the bastion of Black culture here was gutted. 
By the Randomization of Housing Act. 
Second years of color no longer have a say in where they go. 
The culture that's been fostered in this house for two decades will be wiped out in two years. 
Troy looks to see if the speech is working. 
As Sam warms up -- SAM (CONT'D) This wasn't motivated by a desire to mix things up. 
Bring about racial and socioeconomic harmony. 
No, the Black kids are sitting together in the proverbial cafeteria and they must be up to no good. 
Coco's eyes are in the back of her head. 
SAM (CONT'D) We sit together to protect ourselves. 
Over a century of houses grouped by sports affiliations, political leanings, majors, you name it. 
Black folks get their own house, suddenly we got a problem? 
Students look at each other stunned. 
Are they turning? 
Sam delivers the next one directly at Sofia and Troy. 
SAM (CONT'D) This Act doesn't affect the other houses like it does ours. 
There are plenty of trustees, former coaches, and presidents watching out for the others. 
All we have is a Dean who'd rather please his massa -- TROY -- Yo that's enough of that Sam -- 14. 
SAM -- then stand up for his own. 
Look, I know ya'll ain't voting for me. 
Ya'll ain't ready and I didn't come here for that. 
The Black Student Union and I have brought a petition to repeal the Randomization of Housing Act. 
I plan on bringing it to the President and together we can bring Black back to Manchester. 
It'll be by the door. 
Sam sits as claps trickle from the crowd. 
The BoFros go crazy - give her daps and all sorts of praise. 
MARTIN, 20, a gentle erudite giant of a football player with neat braids tucked under a Fedora raises a hand. 
MARTIN I assume everyone has the app I created by now? 
REGGIE (aside) It's a child's app... 
MARTIN Good. 
Voting may commence. 
Everyone takes out smart phones. 
Reggie hides his from view as he punches something in. 
Troy spots the white Sophomores he greeted from before who give him a head nod. 
Troy's got this. 
After a moment... 
MARTIN (CONT'D) Okay. 
Looks like we've got ourselves a winner. (devastated) Sam White? 
The blood drains from Sam's face and Troy's smile plummets into the floor as the two turn to look at each other. 
TROY & SAM Oh shit. 
Reggie's grin is from ear to ear as Helmut walks over and slips a card to a still stunned Sam. 
Coco watches him go. 17 INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 17 Right on the heels of Helmut's exit is... 15. 
COCO So that's what you're looking for? 
HELMUT I'm looking for good TV sister. 
COCO I think I'd be good TV. HELMUT You're at a great school, getting a great education. 
Be good at that. 
COCO I am. 
And when I graduate early with an Economics degree from Manchester it will be the crowning achievement of my Black middle class parents' ambitions. 
HELMUT Conflict is a commodity in my industry. 
Sam's got it. 
Do you? 
COCO So you want me to start a fight. 
HELMUT (exactly) I don't want you to do anything you wouldn't otherwise do. 
Helmut hands her his card. 
A fire sparks in Coco as he exits. 
He contemplates her. 
Fights a growing smile. 18 INT. DEAN'S OFFICE - DAY 18 A fireplace rages behind Lionel who stares at the floor while the message plays over speaker phone. 
SPEAKER ...bigger the dick the less you'll have to pay me to ssssuck it. 
Dean Fairbank's mind ticks away behind a concerned glare. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS Most everything's locked up, but we'll find another residence to move you to. 
Third time's a charm. (off Lionel's sigh) What about Armstrong / Parker? 16. 
LIONEL I don't know... 
DEAN FAIRBANKS I might have an opening. 
Maybe it'd be good to be around...you know. 
LIONEL Dean. 
The worst thing about high school, and believe me it was a long list, were the Black kids. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS Maybe it's in your head. 
Sure, sometimes our folks can be intolerant around people like you. 
Homo -- LIONEL -- I don't believe in labels. 
Fairbanks just smiles. 
This is a sore spot and he backs off. 
Lionel glares up at a poster above Fairbank's desk: Students of all races on the steps of Ellington Library including Troy with the phrase "MANCHESTER: WHERE YOU BELONG" printed below. 
Troy's huge smile seems to mock him. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS You like jazz Lionel? 
Manchester's like jazz you know. 
LIONEL This is a research school. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS And jazz is tension. 
The interplay of improvised solos all creating one song. 
Your problem is you've got no instrument. 
No major, no affiliations, no solo son. 
LIONEL I submit articles to the Independent Observer. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS No one reads the Independent Observer, my point is are you playing swing or bebop? 
LIONEL You're mixing metaphors. 17. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS Are you a sax or are you a trumpet? 
LIONEL I hate jazz. 
Fairbanks checks his watch. 
All out of ideas. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS I'll do what I can. 
Not a word of this in the Observer okay? 
LIONEL What's it matter? 
No one reads it. 19 EXT. MANCHESTER - DAY 19 Lionel walks alone through the buzzing campus. 
He looks out to.. ...a group of BLACK KIDS. He sees a version of himself amongst them - his hair a finger waved Ceasar fade, as he trades "No Homo's" with the others. 
Lionel shakes it off. 
Peers over to a group of out and proud gay kids and sees a version of himself amongst them - his hair straightened and coifed in a fitted shirt laughing. 
Not right either. 
Where does he fit? 
By surprise... 
GEORGE Lionel right? 
GEORGE PIERCE, 24, an intellectual whose tattooed quotes from Nietzsche peek out seductively from under his button up. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) George. 
We had Civ last semester? 
How you doing? 
LIONEL Grood...Gate...I'm ah.. 
GEORGE Fan of your stuff. 
In the Observer? 
LIONEL No one reads the Observer. 
GEORGE You seen this? 
George hands Lionel Sam's "Missing Black Culture" flyer. 18. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) The residents of Armstrong / Parker just made her head of house. 
Am I crazy or is there a there there? 
LIONEL What made you come over here? 
George holds up Sam's "Ebony & Ivy." Lionel takes it. 
LIONEL (CONT'D) I mean I'm glad you came -- GEORGE -- My staff? 
God bless them. 
They're whiter than Michael Jackson's kids. 
We're fucked if anyone of them writes this story and I will not let the transfers at the Gazette do it first. 
LIONEL The oldest one has his face. 
GEORGE You're in the Black Student Union. 
You probably know Sam. 
Lionel shakes his head "yes" and "no" at the same time. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) You come up with a good angle? 
I want it in the Bugle. 
Lionel eyes the bold "Bugle" logo on George's shirt. 
LIONEL (aside) Trumpet... 
GEORGE Bugle. 
Focus. 
The only paper on campus with a national subscription base and an Advisor from the New York Times? 
Only so many ways a person can distinguish themselves at a place like this Lionel. 
You're good. 
You belong with us. 
The way Lionel fights the smile creeping up his face - we know he's never heard these words. 
Never belonged any place. 
Doesn't hurt there's a handsome boy smiling at him either. 19. 20 INT. ARMSTRONG/PARKER DINING HALL - DAY 20 Troy and Sam sit across from each other at a table. 
Their opposite facing laptops and a world of tension put a wall between them. 
TROY Get it yet? 
Sam shakes her head yes. 
TROY (CONT'D) Good. 
You've now got the shared calendar, contacts, and official email. 
Troy throws a smirk her way before pulling out a thick stack of papers. 
TROY (CONT'D) Oh and before I forget. 
SAM Event requests for the year? 
TROY Just this month. 
They need your approval. 
Also don't forget to pick your office hours. 
At least 20 per week. 
SAM That's absurd. 
TROY You're in charge of a hundred residents now. 
And they need time to complain to your face. 
About noise. 
Leaky pipes. 
Gluten free options in the cafeteria. 
Etcetera. 
SAM Troy. 
I didn't think I was going to win. 
TROY And by the way petitioning the President on the Randomization of Housing Act isn't gonna do shit. 
None of the other houses are concerned. 20. 
SAM Because they all have a legacy of rich and powerful allies on the board who will make sure that "random" works out to their advantage. 
TROY And you think a petition is going to change that? 
Troy gets up to leave as Reggie sits - suspicious. 
Sam's phone buzzes: "MOM." The letters chill Sam to the core. 21 INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER - DAY 21 Lionel steps his way through the hall, a deer in headlights with a notepad. 
He flips through Sam's "EBONY & IVY" book... 
SAM (V.O.) The Armstrong / Parker dining hall is the epicenter of Black culture as it stands at Manchester. 
Only here can you commiserate, celebrate and discuss everything from Kanye West lyrics to theoretical relativism all in one sitting. 
Not to mention find someone who can actually do your hair. 
ARMSTRONG / PARKER DINING HALL - CONTINUOUS Lionel enters and takes a place in a line. 
He absorbs this lively and somewhat alien dining hall. 
Troy now holds court near the windows at a table of eight or so friends including Martin and SUNGMI, a lip ringed Korean art major. 
MARTIN "We wuz robbed." That election was suspect man. 
Martin glares at Reggie and his giant souped-up Laptop. 
Sam breaks this by sitting back down - her phone call ending. 
SAM You call me the minute there's an update. 
Love you too mom. 
Sam hangs up. 
The call's really put her in a bad place. 
She sits at a table of her Bofros - who we'll name by their hair. 21. 
CURLS There is one other sister in my Relativity class, I'll be damned if our professor doesn't call me Laretta every God damn time. 
DREADS We all look the same. 
REGGIE Programming professor gets me and Martin here mixed up constantly. 
MARTIN You should be so lucky. 
Reggie glances over at Martin's Mac Air. 
REGGIE Cute. 
You get that at Toys R Us? Sam pulls out her Mac and her student ID card. 
REGGIE (CONT'D) You still using your ID number? 
SAM I always forget passwords. 
REGGIE You are begging to get hacked. 
SAM Good thing the one evil techno- genius thinking like that is on my side. 
Sam pushes aside all the paperwork on her table. 
SAM (CONT'D) So this is what the revolution looks like? 
Office hours and paperwork. 
Sam pulls her camera out - starts to shoot the room. 
REGGIE Winning was a happy accident. 
We want the reform repealed right? 
CURLS Means to an end, sister. 22. 
Sam feels the heat of her disciples' eyes on her as the topic of the day rages on with the entrance of Coco, who sits with a group of well manicured hot-ironed group of girls, white and Black. 
COCO The talented tenth always has to bust its ass a little bit harder, but I don't see the benefit in blaming white folks for everything. 
CURLS Who's blaming? 
TROY I don't see the issue. 
I never had one. 
Never ran into any lynch mobs. 
Lionel takes a seat alone facing the action. 
Kurt and crew enter with plates of mac and cheese and sit in the heart of the conversation. 
Lionel avoids eye contact. 
SAM Lynch mob is still there. 
Just re- branded itself. 
TROY As what pray tell? 
REGGIE The Republican party. 
SAM Want to know how this world sees you? 
Go to a Young Republican's meeting and bring up Welfare. 
SUNGMI Or Immigration. 
LIONEL (aside) Or gay equality. 
KURT Bullshit. 
MARTIN I agree. 
Got something to add? 
KURT The biggest athletes, movie stars, hell your president is Black. (MORE) 23. 
KURT (CONT'D) Sometimes I think the hardest thing to be in the American work force right now is an educated white guy. 
SUNGMI You're not serious. 
KURT You guys still got affirmative action, you're set. 
REGGIE This shit. 
SAM What are you doing in here? 
KURT Obama. 
Leader of the free world got into Harvard on affirmative action. 
Know who's not president right now? 
The guy that didn't get in. 
SAM On behalf of the colored folks in the room, let me apologize for all the better qualified white students whose place we're taking up. 
Kurt chuckles - a bit turned on by the argument. 
SAM (CONT'D) You get lost? 
Bechet is that way. 
KURT Yeah but what other dining hall gives you chicken and waffles? 
Dear White People right? 
Funny stuff. 
How haven't we staffed you yet? 
SAM On Pastiche? 
Your uninspired humor magazine? 
KURT We're a lot more than a magazine sweetie. 
SNL staff is basically half Lampoon, half Pastiche. 
Just like the network comedies. 
A flash of envy comes over Troy and Coco. 24. 
SAM What gives you Clubhouse kids the right to come to our Dining Hall? 
Kurt eats an exaggerated scoop of mac and cheese. 
SAM (CONT'D) You don't live here. 
MARTIN Sam? 
What are you doing? 
SAM You can't eat here. 
Kurt eyes this new adversary. 
Enjoys a good challenge. 
TROY Chill Sam damn. 
Let the man-- KURT & SAM -- I got this. 
KURT Who are you to put me out? 
SAM (realizing) I'm the Head of this house. 
And I'm doing things my way. 
Sam shoots this last one to Martin. 
Kurt rolls his eyes to which Sam slams his tray to the ground. 
Lionel scribbles down notes furiously on a notepad. 
KURT You got any idea who you're -- SAM -- Yeah, I know who your daddy is. 
The same one who's been pushing to break up this House for a decade. 
What's wrong? 
Is he scared letting the Negroes gather in groups might start a rebellion on the plantation? 
You tell him from me...he should be. 
Kurt looks into Sam's eyes and then his crew. 
They want out. 
KURT Bad move. 25. 
Kurt leads his crew out of the dining hall drawing a slight snicker from Lionel which draws Sam's eyes right to him. 
Something sparks in Lionel. 
He takes out his phone and texts to GEORGE: "I've got the angle. 
I'm in." SAM You too. 
LIONEL Me? SAM Is this your house? 
Lionel sinks - the eyes of everyone in the room on him. 
Sam sits back down as a trickle of claps grow to a steady applause. 
Troy and his table look around baffled. 
By the caution on Sam's face it seems the first time she's ever heard this sound directed at her. 
A slight envy boils in Coco. 
One last look to the room from Lionel before he slips out. 
Locked out again. 23 INT. COCO'S ROOM - DAY 23 Coco scrolls Sam's "Dear White People" Youtube page. 75K Subscribers. 
She presses play on the latest video. 
SAM (O.S.) Dear White People, stop dancing. 
Two seconds. 600K views. 
COCO The fuck? 
Coco exits and opens her own "TIME AT AN IVY LEAGUE" page. 2K subscribers. 
Her latest video is at 10K views. 
Alright... 
She presses record. 
Let's the camera rest on her briefly... 
COCO (CONT'D) Muffins. 
I hate to do it, but Imma have to get real Black with you. (comes to mind) So the other day, a girl had the nerve to fix her mouth and ask me if my hair was weaved. (after a moment) Weaved. 
Weaved bitch? (MORE) 26. 
COCO (CONT'D) First of all if you're going to fix your mouth to ask me something like that, say it right please? 
It's weave. 
Noun. 
Present tense. 
Second of all don't assume just because you see a sister with some hair it's a weave. 
Is it? 
Clearly. 
If a bitch could grow straight Indian hair directly out her own head I wouldn't have just overdrafted my account paying for this shit but that ain't your business. 
Are those your lips sweetie? 
Sweet heart is that really your skin? 
These white girls and these tans I swear to God, they're starting to look darker than me. 
Coco pauses it. 
Her mouse hovers over the check box next to "private." Instead she plays it back...and hits "publish." She clicks back through to Sam's last video and hits "reply." As the red light on her computer's web cam turns green... 
COCO (CONT'D) Dear White People. 
What do I think about it? 24 INT. SCREENING ROOM - DAY 24 Sam with arms folded watches as Gabe (Sam's caller from earlier) presses play on a DVD. Horrified students watch... ...a Black and white 1920's style silent movie, complete with Dialogue Cards and dramatic PIANO MUSIC. SERIES OF SHOTS - ON THE SCREEN A) OBAMA speaks at a debate B) DIALOGUE CARD: "We are the change that we seek." C) A FAMILY in white-face go ape-shit D) DIALOGUE CARD: "HE'S READING OFF A TELEPROMPTER!!!!!!" E) More intercut footage of Obama speaking with actors in white-face reacting. 
Until... 
F) DIALOGUE CARD: OBAMA WINS A SECOND TERM! G) A WHITE-FACE CROWD goes nuts in the streets - scream into camera - loot buildings and shoot themselves in the head. 27. 
H) Dialogue Card: "FIN" PROFESSOR BODKIN, late 40s, with a "seen it all before" demeanor hides a grin and lets the room settle. 
PROFESSOR BODKIN Okay. 
Does anyone have any comments for Sam's "Rebirth of a Nation?" All of the kids are too scared to comment. 
Except... 
PROFESSOR BODKIN (CONT'D) Gabe, go ahead. 
GABE I dig the "silent movie" thing, but it's a little self-congratulatory. 
Light on story and frankly thematically dubious. 
PROFESSOR BODKIN Okay. 
Anybody else? 
SAM What? 
SAME PLACE - MOMENTS LATER As students filter out of the class... 
PROFESSOR BODKIN Sam? 
SAM Before you say anything might I remind you that I sat through Birth of A Nation, Gone With The Wind, and Tarantino week without protest. 
PROFESSOR BODKIN And might I remind you that I read all fifteen pages of your unsolicited essay on why Gremlins is actually about suburban white fear of Black culture. 
SAM The Gremlins are loud, talk in slang, are addicted to fried chicken and freak out when you get their hair wet. 28. 
PRESIDENT BODKIN My only problem with your movie is that it was late. 
The silent projects were last semester Sam. 
You were supposed to have emailed your sound treatment over Summer. 
SAM I've been getting footage. 
PROFESSOR BODKIN This is your senior thesis Sam, where the hell is your head at? 
SAM I've got Radio, BSU, this Head of House thing -- PROFESSOR BODKIN -- Do you want this? 
Cause if not, don't waste my time here -- Sam pulls out the Super 8 camera from her satchel. 
SAM -- Look this thing might as well be my right hand Professor. 
I was busy this summer that's all. 
PROFESSOR BODKIN With everything but your major? 
While your peers are taking internships, making short films... 
SAM My dad. 
He's sick. 
Had to go home. 
PROFESSOR BODKIN If you need some time off, take it. 
But if you want to make it to next semester -- SAM -- I do -- PROFESSOR BODKIN -- Pull it together. 
This is Manchester. 
Sam wants this. 
It's in her eyes as she holds her tongue. 25 EXT. MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY - DAY 25 Sam exits the theater and spots Gabe talking to some guys. 29. 
SAM Thematically dubious? 
GABE Well what was that supposed to be about exactly? 
SAM You're thematically dubious! Gabe rolls his eyes and catches up with her. 
SAM (CONT'D) Since when do TA's give critiques? 
GABE You invoke Minstrelsy for shock value, but to what end? 
SAM To invoke the same feeling I get when I turn on the TV and see some so-called reality star shuck and jive for ratings egged on by no doubt white producers. 
Or the sassy Black secretary with no backstory or character development aside from their skin color. 
GABE So it's a tit for tat? * EXT. GOODMAN MEDIA SCHOOL 2 - DAY * SAM * You're honestly saying that art * can't be reactionary? * GABE * You're reacting to a work made * almost a hundred years ago. * SAM * Yes because fear of Black men being * involved in the United States * Government is a completely * antiquated concept. 
No social * relevance whatsoever today. * GABE * Frankly I just think sometimes its * better to hold a mirror up to your * audience than to drop an * ideological piano over their head. * 30. 
SAM * Frankly I just think works that * deal with the African Diaspora * through a post-modern lens are * outright rejected unless they're * handled by a white artist. * GABE * African Diaspora? 
Really? * 26 INT. DAVIS HOUSE - DAY 26 The war rages as the two continue up a fleet of stairs. 
SAM Blackface is alive and well in our culture. 
Who primarily buys hip hop? 
Watches Housewives of Atlanta? 
The same homogenized images of Black people over and over again? 
White people Gabe. 
GABE Who goes to see Tyler Perry movies? 
SAM We're an underfed community. 
None of this changes the fact that the vibrancy, the complexity of Black culture has been distilled into commodities and marketing schemes to be bought and sold-- GABE --to the detriment of the so called "real thing." Got it. 
And into a room... 
INT. GABE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS Gabe slams the door. 
SAM I am indistinguishable from the so called "urban" images used to amuse and market to white America. 
GABE And the commodification of culture is uniquely oppressive to Black people? 31. 
Sam nods fervently as Gabe grabs and unbuttons her jeans. 
GABE (CONT'D) So when Kanye raps about Louis V and Rolexes and Classical Art, exactly what exploited pocket of Black America are those references being mined from? 
Sam can't get her shirt off fast enough. 
SAM On your knees. 
Gabe kneels below frame as Sam closes her eyes in ecstacy. 
CUT TO BLACK. 27A INT. GABE'S ROOM - EVENING 27A Sam's eyes pop open - a startled scream escapes her lips. 
She's surprised at first to see Gabe beside her in bed, the outside spoon. 
They're both naked. 
Her pompadour frayed. 
GABE What? 
You dream in "Cosby" again? 
SAM My hair was so straight. 
My sweater so big. 
I told you about that? 
Sam's phone buzzes. 
Gabe grabs it and sees Reggie's photo pop up. 
He swallows his envy and hands it to Sam. 
She doesn't answer. 
Silence as it hits her voicemail. 
GABE Hey so...this whole "Head of House" thing. 
Congrats? 
SAM Yeah, it's...it's. 
GABE Weird, right? 
Never took you as a student politician... 
Reggie's photo again - New Voicemail. 
A regret in Sam's eyes. 
SAM Yeah, well... 
Sam rolls out of bed. 
Gabe thinks twice before he asks it. 32. 
GABE Sam? 
What are we doing? 
She badly wants to give him the answer he wants. 
Instead... 
SAM Fucking. 28 INT. STUDIO BOOTH - DAY 28 Reggie stares at Sam with stars in his eyes as she effortlessly addresses the campus in between bits of jazz. 
SAM (V.O.) Dear White People. 
Please stop touching my hair. 29 INT. GARMIN CLUB HOUSE - DAY 29 Lionel at an ancient oak dining room table listens to the broadcast over his laptop. 
Makes studious notations... 
SAM (V.O.) Does this look like a petting zoo to you? 
Lionel gets an IM: "George: Hey handsome, how's the story?" To which Lionel writes: "Going great sexy." Lionel deletes "sexy" and replaces it with ":)" before hitting send. 29A BAR DIVIDE 29A Across from Lionel is Kurt flanked by his eager but self conscious right hand GORDON - and MITCH, swagged out varsity crew captain and connoisseur of all things Black culture. 
They wear "PASTICHE" gear, hunch over a glowing iPad and scroll through a series of student group photos in the Yearbook. 
Kurt stares off into space, turns up the GANGSTA RAP playing from a nearby blue tooth speaker. 
Kurt pours shots of Jack which Gordon eyes with caution. 
GORDON Kurt it's three. 
MITCH Y.O.L.O. my nigga! Everyone takes the shot. 33. 
GORDON We don't even have our new staff yet. 
Why are we planning this? 
KURT Everyone wants to be on our staff that's the easy part. 
MITCH We're going to make staff bids on Game Night, and the RSVP's are through the roof for that. 
KURT Yeah but Halloween is our premiere party. 
The waitlist is already a hundred deep and it's going to take a lot to outdo this summer. 
MITCH Cinco de Mayo was epic. 
INSERT: A black and white photo of Kurt and crew dressed in Sombreros and Mexican stereotypes at a wild pool party. 
The title reads... 
PASTICHE PRESENTS "WETBACK" GORDON How about the Young Republicans? 
KURT Too close to the Tea-Party. 
INSERT: Photo of Kurt and crew dressed as famous female political conservatives - brandishing rally signs with misspellings and cups of tea. 
The title reads... "PASTICHE'S TEA PARTY" MITCH Yo we need an East vs West hip hop party. 
Get the honeys in here. 
GORDON "The honeys?" You're from Vermont. 
KURT Guys what's the Pastiche motto? 
GORDON "Sharpen thy sword." 34. 
MITCH Our motto is a euphemism for masturbation? 
GORDON It's a reminder that satire is the weapon of reason. 
So who on campus is being unreasonable? 
MITCH Sounds like a reminder of how gay you are. 
GORDON Was that even a reasonable attempt at a quip Mitch? 
MITCH Hey Gordon, say reasonable again. 
SAM (O.S.) Dear White People, knowing Lil' Wayne lyrics no longer earns you an Honorary Black Card. 
It just reminds me how often you say the word "nigga" when no one Black is around as is required in reciting said lyrics. 
Kurt turns up his music and shoots Lionel a look, who plugs headphones into his computer and looks down. 
KURT The hell does Sam think she is? 
MITCH Like Spike Lee and Oprah had a pissed off baby. 
Kurt shares a glance with Mitch and Gordon - they're leaning towards the same idea. 
KURT Could we? 
GORDON How? 
Kurt turns his heat towards Lionel - has a bone to pick. 
KURT Hey Lionel. 
Talked to the Dean today. (MORE) 35. 
KURT (CONT'D) We had a very enlightening conversation. 
I just want to say... 
I'm sorry about the voice message. 29B DINING ROOM 29B Kurt and his crew cross over to Lionel's table. 
Kurt unzips his pants silently. 
KURT (CONT'D) Do you accept? 
Lionel removes the headphones and turns to Kurt, just as he starts flopping his dick around off screen. 
Lionel quickly looks in the other direction. 
Kurt's friends crack up. 
GORDON Please put that away. 
KURT You got to talk to these people in a language they'll understand. 
Lionel shoves his headphones back on over his fro. 
LIONEL Pathetic. 
KURT (yelling) Wherever he ships you off to, be sure to pack a sense of humor with you, kay bro? 
Lionel drowns them out. 
He flips through Sam's "Ebony & Ivy" book to a section called... 
SAM (V.O.) The Paper Bag Tests. 
As Lionel reads we swish pan to... 30 DREAM DINER 30 ...an abstract Diner set. 
Sam at the counter addresses us. 
SUPERIMPOSE: THE TIP TEST SAM The Tip Test. 
You hit up Jelly's for a snack. 
Your waitress mistakes you for someone who looks like you (Black) who once ran up a thirty dollar bill and left a dollar tip. 36. 
WAITRESS, over it, crosses frame and glares coldly at us. 
Lionel takes a seat at a booth with Sam across from him. 
SAM (CONT'D) You watch all the other customers order before you do... 
Waitress huffs her way over to Lionel. 
LIONEL Pastrami sandwich on rye. 
SAM ...then proceed to wait no less than forty minutes for your food. 
A wall-clock advances forty, before the food and check come. 
SAM (CONT'D) How do you tip? 
A... 
LIONEL Forty minutes? 
Man she's lucky I leave her forty cents. 
You do a good job, maybe you'll see a tip. 
SAM B... 
LIONEL Doris was tripping, but fifteen percent is the least I can do. 
SAM Or C... 
LIONEL I reject the stereotype that African American's don't tip. 
I'm leaving her twenty, no twenty five, just to prove I can! CUT TO: Lionel's back in reality. 
He ponders the scenario. 
LIONEL (CONT'D) C? 
He turns the book upside down and reads the small print on the bottom of the page. "A) ONE HUNDRED" "B) OOFTA" and his answer "C) NOSE-JOB." 37. 
LIONEL (CONT'D) Nose-job? 31 EXT. MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY - DAY 31 The campus has settled into the semester as students trudge back and forth to class. 
SAM (V.O.) Dear White People in a shocking reversal using the term "African American" is borderline racist now. 32 INT. DEAN FAIRBANKS OFFICE - DAY 32 Dean Fairbanks and PRESIDENT HERBERT FLETCHER, 50's in an even better suit than Fairbanks listen to the radio. 
Fairbanks eyeballs Fletcher - tension between the two. 
SAM (O.S.) Turns out if you're too worried about Political Correctness to say "Black", odds are you secretly just want to call us niggers anyway and truth be told I'd rather you just be honest about it. 
PRESIDENT FLETCHER Free speech my ass. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS Stalin quotes for two hundred? 
PRESIDENT FLETCHER You're joking about this? 
DEAN FAIRBANKS I'm sorry, was I supposed to take "Free speech my ass" as a legitimate suggestion? 
PRESIDENT FLETCHER This is your office's issue Walter. 
Especially after that episode with Kurt in the dining hall. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS Every race issue is my issue. 
PRESIDENT FLETCHER It's a student issue. 
You are the Dean of students aren't you? 
The two share an old and heated glare. 38. 
PRESIDENT FLETCHER (CONT'D) The Times has been watching us like a hawk. 
Last thing we need is some "race war" on newspapers across the country. 
How do you think our donor base will feel about that? 
Our fund- raiser is four weeks away. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS How bad is this deficit of yours? 
PRESIDENT FLETCHER Worse. 
But let me tell you something. 
If this blows up any further? 
It's on you Walter. 
Racism is over in America. 
And if anyone's still dealing with it, it's the -- I don't know Mexicans probably. 
Troy pokes his head in. 
Fairbanks cuts the radio off. 
PRESIDENT FLETCHER (CONT'D) Come on in. 
TROY President Fletcher. 
PRESIDENT FLETCHER Son, call me Herb. 
Fairbanks grits his teeth as Fletcher exits and Troy sits. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS President Fletcher tells me his son got his ass handed to him. 
Troy hates this game. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT'D) Bout time. 
Can't tell you how many instances I had to defend Armstrong / Parker when I was Head of House. 
TROY Sam's out of line. 
Kurt's alright. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS But you're supposed to be better than alright. 
Since when do we lose elections Troy? 
TROY The Housing Act passing without a fight didn't help. 39. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS What have I told you about excuses? 
TROY Pops my course load is full anyway. 
I'm head of Econ Board, I'm thinking about Pastiche. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS Pastiche? 
On Kurt Fletcher's staff? 
TROY You know to round out the res? 
DEAN FAIRBANKS I'll be God damned if twenty years from now you have to end up working for that dumb asses son. 
TROY (put in his place) Yes sir. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS Fletcher and I graduated a year apart. 
He barely made it through. 
I graduated Summa cum Laude. 
Now look who's President and who's Dean. 
TROY What's the difference? 
DEAN FAIRBANKS A couple hundred grand a year. 
Understand what I'm saying? 
Now what happened between you and Sam to make her come after you anyway? 
TROY Sofia. 
You remember Sofia? 
Daughter of the President. 
Psych major. "Has the world ahead of her Troy." DEAN FAIRBANKS I don't like your tone boy. 
TROY Sorry sir. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS So you lost the House. 
On to the school presidency then. 
The light in Troy's eyes dims a bit. 40. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT'D) It'll be good to show this campus is capable of electing someone like you as school president. 
TROY Someone like me? 33 INT. TROY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT 33 Troy hovers over the toilet - smokes weed while the shower runs - exhales through his paper towel / dryer sheet apparatus. 
He jots down on a notepad and LAUGHS to himself. 
TROY'S APARTMENT - SAME TIME Sofia has her face to the floor - peering underneath the bathroom door. 
She can see Troy's feet. 
What the hell? 
Off the SQUEAK of the shower being cut Sofia jumps up. 
MOMENTS LATER Troy bounds out the bathroom in his undies. 
Sofia on the couch pretends to have been watching television. 
TROY Babe. 
Hat or no hat? 
Troy stands before her in his undies holding a Kangol. 
He eyes her oversized T-shirt. 
TROY (CONT'D) Are you wearing that? 
SOFIA I don't have to be. 
Sofia yanks Troy to her by his underwear to kiss his navel. 
SOFIA (CONT'D) Hey boo...why don't we put some of your new found free time to good use? 
It's been a while since... 
TROY What's with all this boo stuff? 
SOFIA ...since you fucked me with your big Black cock. 
Troy pulls away. 41. 
SOFIA (CONT'D) It used to turn you on when I talked like that. 
Is it me? 
TROY (yes) I love you. 
SOFIA Is it Sam? 
TROY Can we please just, get ready? 
SOFIA Why? 
I hate my brother's friends. 
Troy thinks over his next words carefully. 
TROY You're not going to go with me? 
SOFIA You'd go without me? 
Troy tries to flash a charming shrug. 
SOFIA (CONT'D) You're my guest! Sofia gathers some books and heads for the door. 
TROY You can hang out while I'm -- SOFIA -- Okay, what's with you and my brother? 
Are you in love with him? 
Is this like, some DL shit? 
Sofia storms out. 
TROY "DL shit!?" 34 INT. FOREST - NIGHT 34 Lionel walks up the darkly lit stairs of a very old building. 
He reaches a door marked "Newsroom." 35 INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT 35 Lionel looks around the dimmed office. 
There is music and light coming from a room past all the cubicles... 42. 36 INT. BULLPEN - NIGHT 36 ...An office filled with computers. 
George and a few other EDITORS scream with laughter - beers and pizza in hand. 
GEORGE does a beat on his desk while... 
GEORGE I keeps it clean Ya know what I mean. 
I drinks my Vodka straight, like I'm a fiend. 
ANNIE, a strawberry blonde laughs in George's lap. 
Lionel's envy shows. 
ANNIE Wait, quiet I want to hear this. 
Annie turns up a Youtube video of... 
COCO (O.S.) If I could grow straight Indian hair out my head -- ANNIE Ohmigod, this is going on Facebook. 
Annie swivels in her chair only to SCREAM BLOODY MURDER at the sight of Lionel. 
LIONEL Relax the Negro at the door is not here to rape you. 
Annie laughs. 
The mood is drunk and light. 
LIONEL (CONT'D) So this is what editors do? 
GEORGE We're taking a break, what are you doing here? 
LIONEL You wanted me to drop in and tell you how the story was coming? 
GEORGE Yeah like this week. 
It's Saturday night. 
You got nowhere else to be? 
LIONEL It was this or the new Madea movie. 43. 
GEORGE Dear God. 
Where does Madea go this time? 
Dialysis? 37 EXT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT 37 Sam, flanked by Reggie and the BoFros are in mid rant. 
REGGIE Man fuck Tyler Perry. 
SAM Like, can we have a movie with, you know characters in them? `Stead of stereotypes wrapped in Christian dogma? 
REGGIE Why is every educated person inherently evil? 
Why this Nigga gotta be in a mutha fucking dress all the mutha fucking time? 
SAM How come the only Black movies Hollywood wants to make are ones with mammies in fat suits or Black women in pain man? 
All of this is directed at a TEENAGER in the box office. 
TEENAGER Most people are here to see Fang 9. (after a beat) Kelly Rowland's in it? 
The group throw up their hands and groan in protest. 38 INT. KURT'S HOUSE - NIGHT 38 Game Night and Kurt's house is filled with smoke, music, and rich kids who play cards at various tables. 
Coco, in a banging jumpsuit scans the room for prospects. 
A few eyes from the WHITE BOYS start to flicker her way. 
This perks her up, as she arches her back slightly... ...only to see their eyes follow the WHITE BRUNETTE HIPSTER GIRL who has entered behind her. 
Coco catches herself in the mirror. 
What don't they see? 38A CARD TABLE 38A 44. 
Troy deals cards at a table - the game is Texas Hold Em. Troy holds court - much to Kurt's chagrin. 
The mood is playful. 
There's a brief eye contact between Troy and Coco. 39 INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 39 A huge "Boycott Sal's Pizzeria" poster hangs on the walls of Sam's chic dorm surrounded by other street art. 
The BoFros and a few cool residents of Armstrong / Parker hang about. 
Underground hip hop permeates the room. 
Sam refuses a joint coldly from Reggie - her eyes fixed on "SCHOOL DAZE" which plays on her 36' flatscreen. 
SAM How `bout you stop stereotyping yourself and put that shit out? 
This ain't "Friday." REGGIE Yo Sam. 
We got to talk about the protest. 
When are we are bringing the Housing fight to the prez? 
Sungmi takes a seat next to Sam. 
Some kids hop up and start grooving it out when a new song pops up on the playlist. 
SUNGMI The House voted down sponsoring the rally. 
REGGIE What do we need it sponsored for? 
SAM Demonstrations can get shut down if a House doesn't sponsor them. 
REGGIE Like the House you're head of? 
Sam shoots Reggie a glare. 
He backs off. 
SUNGMI Hey Sam, I read "Ebony and Ivy." What's with the Oofta, Nose-Jobs, One Hundred stuff? 
I miss something? 
Sam smiles. 
SAM You want me to break it down? 45. 40 INT. KURT'S HOUSE - NIGHT 40 Troy deals another hand with Kurt, Mitch and Gordon. 
Troy's homeboy swag is thicker than usual. 
MITCH Yo my perfect Friday night is whiskey and my T-Bone Walker records, real talk. 
TROY Who the fuck is T-Bone Walker? 40A INTERCUT WITH SAM'S APARTMENT: 40A SAM Only a few ways colored folks survive at a place like this. 
MITCH Uh only a pioneer of electric and jump blues bro. 
Know your roots. 
TROY White folks always be on stuff like decades too late and act like they discovered some shit. 
SAM "Oofta" is the jazz age term for Bojangle types who Blacked it up for White audiences. 
MITCH Don't sleep on T-Bone man. 
TROY Rock, Jazz, Blues - Nigga whatchu got on right now? 
MITCH Public Enemy my Nig-- TROY --Yo watch that man. 
GORDON You just called him -- TROY -- Ya'll get Country Clubs we get to say Nigga. 
Everyone at the table erupts in laughter. 
Except Kurt. 46. 
GORDON And golf? 
And all our girls? 
TROY Whatchu mean all your girls? 
GORDON Dude, between OJ, Tiger, Wesley Snipes and uh, Troy over here... 
TROY Yo. It's a word for that. 
Reparations. 
More Kurt-less laughter from the table. 
TROY (CONT'D) Forty white bitches and a mule. 
Perfectly executed. 
Troy grins as the table erupts. 
SAM An Oofta modulates his Blackness up or down depending on the crowd and what he wants from them. 
MITCH Kurt? 
KURT What? 
GORDON Kurt. 
Troy watches this exchange closely. 
GORDON (CONT'D) Troy. 
You thinking about Pastiche? 
TROY That's the magazine right? 
GORDON For starters. 
MITCH What other "magazine" you know has a first look deal at NBC? The third biggest Youtube channel. 
Talk show. 
Platinum comedy record homie! 47. 
GORDON Couldn't you see him on the talk show Kurt? 
Kurt looks at his cards. 
KURT I fold. 41 INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 41 A small crowd's formed around Sam. 
SUNGMI Okay, and a nose-job is a wannabe? 42 INT. KURT'S HOUSE - NIGHT 42 Coco finishes her drink and catches Mitch and Gordon as they start up a Youtube video on their iPad. 
The previous game is over. 
They watch "Dear White People - 1,378,480 views." 42A INTERCUT WITH SAM'S APARTMENT: 42A SAM Sort of. 
Nose-jobs smooth their Black edges and try to blend. 
Coco runs her fingers through her straight hair. 
GORDON You seen this one? 
SAM (YOUTUBE) Dear White People using Instagram. 
You have an iPhone and go on hikes. 
I get it. 
COCO Ugh. 
Gordon and Mitch turn and notice Coco. 
Mitch eyes her curves. 
GORDON Not a fan? 
Coco makes a "no" face. 
MITCH Sup ma? 
COCO Don't talk like that. 48. 
GORDON Hey I know you... 
Coco is taken aback as Gordon punches up her video and plays it back. 
She hovers over them. 
COCO (YOUTUBE) Muffins. 
I hate to do it, but Imma have to get real Black with you. 
Coco a bit embarrassed scans the view count. 
SAM A Nose-job's worst fear is that their "Blackness" might cause a fuss or draw undue attention so they apologize for it or use it to self deprecate. 
COCO Forty thousand views already? 
GORDON Looks like someone submitted you to Buzzfeed. 
Taking off... 
Coco leans over them and scrolls down. 
The first comment is from a HELMUT: "Much better..." Coco soaks this in. 
MITCH You wan' a drink a sun'in? 
COCO Let me guess you're from Ohio? 
MITCH Vermont. 
GORDON What do you have against Dear White People? 
Coco smiles and slyly clicks to her next video. 
COCO (YOUTUBE) Dear White People. 
How do I feel about it? 
Well for one it's Blacker than thou propaganda from a bougie Lisa Bonet wannabe who smells like patchouli and frankly I can't believe we're letting Sam get away with it. 49. 
Mitch and Gordon's mouths are ajar. 
Coco studies the view count...26,758. 
A pride strikes Coco. 43 INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 43 As the impromptu party dies down... 
SUNGMI Okay and One Hundred? 
REGGIE Keeping it One-Hundred! Being Black as hell just cause. 
Sam rolls her eyes. 
SUNGMI But what about just being you? 
SAM Like I said... 44 INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT 44 Lionel's got the eyes of the Bullpen on him. 
Annie's really warmed to him - her hands play with his afro. 
ANNIE You don't mind do you? 
SAM (V.O.) There's only a few ways a person of a color can survive at a place like this... 
LIONEL Of course not. 
GEORGE Alright so then what? 
LIONEL So then Sam says "What, is your daddy scared the Negroes are gonna start a rebellion on the plantation?" George goes CRAZY at this. 
GEORGE To Kurt Fletcher!? 
LIONEL Yeah. 
Yes. 
Yup. 50. 
GEORGE We've got a news item but there's something bigger here. 
It's a profile piece on Armstrong / Parker and Sam White's pseudo revolution. 
ANNIE What's the headline? 
LIONEL Outdated nationalist seeks purpose starts race war? 
Lionel's joke hits, but he feels gross for saying it. 
The image of Sam shaking her head in the dinner FLASHES before Lionel briefly. 
GEORGE Beers in the corner. 
Bang out the news item tonight and we'll work on the profile piece for next week. 
Lionel grabs a beer and takes a seat at one of the open computers. 
George starts up a beat on his desk as he and Annie stare at Lionel expectantly. 
LIONEL What are you doing? 
ANNIE All Bugle staffer must freestyle. 
It's law. 
GEORGE You want to be a staffer right? 
LIONEL (awkward) My name is Lionel Kind of like a lion King of the jungle Indigenous to Africa... 
The beat has long since stopped. 
LIONEL (CONT'D) Sorry. 45 INT. KURT'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 45 Troy heads into the kitchen just as Kurt heads out. 51. 
TROY Yo man, you know I wasn't talking about Sof back there with whole forty bitches thing. 
I was just -- KURT -- trying to get on my staff? 
TROY I never really thought about -- KURT -- Bullshit. 
Game Night is where we make our bids for the new staff. 
It's why everyone's here. 
You were practically about to bust out a tap dance. 
TROY I'm a Poly Sci major man. 
I just came to hang out. 
KURT My staff likes you. 
A lot. 
TROY But you don't. 
KURT This thing with you and Sof... 
TROY I'm good to her. 
KURT Our dad's have been playing a game of chess off and on since 1972. 
TROY What and Sof is the White queen? 
KURT You're a pawn. 
And I think it's time you get off the board bro. 
Troy takes this in. 
KURT (CONT'D) Here's the deal. 
Every year we throw a party. 
The point is to mock the self important and moronic entities of the campus. 
The way to get staffed is to write an invite for the party. (MORE) 52. 
KURT (CONT'D) Our invites are legendary, we make Gawker, the Post, tons of blogs every year. 
If your invite is the one that goes out, you're guaranteed a spot on the staff. 
The runners up are voted on by the rest of us. 
Troy catches eyes with Coco who gives him a seductive glance. 45A LIVING ROOM 45A Coco turns back to her now enamored crowd. 
She's in her element with these boys at her feet. 
COCO I just think having good hair and carrying on with a degree of sophistication doesn't make me a traitor to the race. 
MITCH Want to know why they used to call me Black Mitch? 
GORDON COCO Absolutely not. 
No one called you that. 
KITCHEN Just as Gordon, Mitch and Coco approach... 
TROY Okay. 
And what's this year's theme? 
Kurt rolls his eyes instinctively. 
KURT Still working on that... 
TROY The party's a couple weeks away. 
GORDON Yo Kurt. 
I want you to meet someone. 
COCO You guys got a party coming up? 
Coco smiles at Kurt, before flicking her eyes over Troy. 53. 46 INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 46 Sungmi is one of the last to clear out of Sam's apartment as the party winds down. 
SUNGMI Hey, about the rally. 
You could still get the permit anyway Sam and go against the board. 
Most people consider that political suicide though. 
REGGIE We got to rally Sam. 
Time is now. 
SAM Use your head Reggie. 
You think a rally is going to change things? 
REGGIE It'll do a hell of a lot more than a radio show or views on Youtube. 
Everyone gets quiet. 
Sungmi takes this time to exit. 
REGGIE (CONT'D) Look, we got power Sam and it's time we used it. 
We earned it. 
SAM We? I didn't see you running for shit Reggie. 
The Bofros trade looks as Reggie storms out. 
Sam waits a beat and rolls her eyes. 47 EXT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER QUAD - NIGHT 47 Sam walks after Reggie. 
REGGIE Tired. 
SAM Don't "one word" me. 
REGGIE Why you got to snap at me all the time? 
I'm around you like twenty four seven. 
Like your lap dog. 
I don't even usually get down like that with no red bone chicks man. 54. 
SAM Don't call me that. 
REGGIE Come on, I thought your ass was Puerto Rican when I met you. 
Sam turns to go. 
REGGIE (CONT'D) Oh so you can dish it out but you can't take it? 
SAM I'm taking my ass home. 
REGGIE Come on Sam. 
You know how I feel about you. 
SAM How am I supposed to know how you feel about me? 
REGGIE You know what? 
Forgive me if I see something in you. 
Something inspiring. 
Something folks like me can get behind. 
Reggie puts his hands on Sam's belt and pulls her in to a kiss as a group walks by. 
Over Reggie's shoulder Sam sees... ...Gabe look back at her. 
He's heartbroken. 
She pretends not to be affected and sinks into a kiss from Reggie. 
REGGIE (CONT'D) Tell me you'll set up the rally. 
SAM I'll set up the rally. 48 INT. KURT'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 48 Kurt, Gordon, Mitch, Coco and Troy all trade glances. 
GORDON Are we sure about this? 
KURT It's ironic. 
Bold. 
And don't tell me I'm the only one who thinks Sam White's little movement needs to get cut down to size. 55. 
Agreement Coco's gaze. 
Uncertainty in Troy's. 
KURT (CONT'D) Looks like you got your Hip Hop party Mitch. 
MITCH `Bout time. 
It's going to be huge man, fucking epic. 
Kurt holds back a smile. 
KURT Boys, we've got a lot more mingling to do. 
We'll be in touch. 
And Troy? 
Get off the board bro. 
Troy chews on this as Kurt leads his group out. 
Troy smiles, goes to exit. 
TROY Nice seeing you. 
COCO Where's Sofia? 
TROY I have no idea. 
COCO Trouble in paradise? 
Troy shrugs and heads to the party. 
COCO (CONT'D) Figures. (off Troy's incredulousness) Nothing. 
I'm sure you've got something else fair and petite and...fair lined up for that drink. 
TROY What's that supposed to mean? 
COCO It's fine. 
I'm not even really into Black dudes anyway. 
TROY I'll have you know I'm an equal opportunity employer, okay? 56. 
COCO And what kind of jobs are you hiring for mister? 
Coco's stiletto rubs the side of Troy's calf. 
TROY Aren't you and Sofia -- COCO -- I'm an accessory to Sofia. 
Can't ever shake the feeling I'm an assignment for that Afro Studies Minor of hers. 
Troy nervously glances out at the crowd and then back towards this dangerous and tempting creature before him. 
COCO (CONT'D) I'm sure you have no idea what I mean. 49 EXT. MANCHESTER YARD - NIGHT 49 Lionel and George walk through the campus at night. 
George waves goodbye to Annie as they pass Bechet House. 
LIONEL She seems really cool. 
George just smiles. 
GEORGE Did we go too far? 
You're in Armstrong/Parker right? 
LIONEL No. Garmin. 
GEORGE Fancy. 
LIONEL George I'm not exactly down with Sam and I'm not in the BSU. I got kicked out of Armstrong / Parker same as Kurt. 
But I'm going to write a good story, okay? 
GEORGE I hope so. 
I want a Bugle on your chest by the end of the month. 
Lionel fights a smile as his heart beats through his chest. 57. 
They reach the front of Lionel's house. 
George runs his hand through Lionel's hair. 
Mitch, smoking on the porch with some other kids - trade glances. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) Your fro's so gnarly. 
LIONEL I'm growing it out. 
GEORGE Night Lionel. 
Lionel heads up his stoop - past the snickers and glares of Mitch and company. 
MITCH Party's not over. 
LIONEL I live here. 
MITCH Sorry bro. 
Invitation only. 
LIONEL It's two in the morning. 
Mitch shrugs as humiliation floods over Lionel. 
Lionel sighs and slumps on the steps outside the door. 
He scrolls through his phone for a contact...OFFICE OF THE DEAN. Starts an email. 50 INT. TROY'S BEDROOM - MORNING 50 Troy's Kangol sits in the ground, besides his undies, and besides a bright pink thong. 
Coco's pink painted finger nails travel through the creases of Troy's immaculate abs. 
TROY Coco huh? 
COCO Colandrea doesn't exactly pass the resume test, you know? 
I mean couldn't you fucking die? 
My parents should've just named me Ghetto-ass-hoodrat-anisha. 
Do you...indulge? 
Coco fiddles in her purse - pulls out a joint. 58. 
TROY It's ten am. 
Coco lights it and takes a drag. 
She hands it to Troy. 
TROY (CONT'D) I don't mess with that stuff. 
Coco sees right through him as Troy hits it like a pro. 
COCO Sure about that? 
TROY Sure you don't like Black guys? 
COCO Girl like me is just a placeholder for ya'll at a place like this. 
TROY I'm not like that. 
COCO I don't think Sam would agree. 
TROY That was different. 
COCO No it wasn't. 
Poor thing, she was light skin-ded and everything. 
TROY Yo, it wasn't like that alright? 
Troy's tone sobers Coco a bit. 
She places a hand on Troy's. 
TROY (CONT'D) My pops. 
He wanted me with Fletcher's daughter. 
They've been in competition ever since they went here. 
Pops hates that Fletcher ended up President and he got stuck as the Dean. 
COCO So your upbringing may have actually fucked you up more than mine? 
That's hot. 
Troy laughs and takes the joint back. 59. 
COCO (CONT'D) The hell is the difference between a Dean and a President anyway? 
TROY Apparently four hundred years of unreconciled oppression. 
COCO He's not going to like you running with the Pastiche boys is he? 
TROY If I even get tapped. 
COCO You will. 
And you should do it. 
They all land somewhere big, some before they even graduate. 
I've seen you in front of a crowd Troy. 
I bet you could be famous. 
TROY That what you want? 
To be famous? 
COCO I want people to know my name. 
TROY Which one? 
Coco's phone buzzes with a message. 
It's Kurt. 
COCO (reading) We want you. 
Come by Ellington tomorrow at eight. (to Troy) Anything? 
Troy checks his phone. 
Nothing. 
A decision weighs in Troy's eyes as Coco throws on a shirt and gets up to go. 
COCO (CONT'D) You're going to have to stand up to him sooner or later Troy. 52 EXT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER QUAD - DAY 52 Troy and Sofia stand still amidst the bustle. 
Devastation marks her pretty face. 
SOFIA You said you loved me. 60. 
TROY I like you a lot. 
Salt meet wound. 
She wants to go, but something nags at her. 
SOFIA What do you do in the bathroom? 
When you leave the shower running? 
Was it just to get away from me? 
Troy wagers his answer and decides to confess. 
TROY I smoke weed and write jokes. 
Puzzled by the man before her and too hurt for more, Sofia just turns and walks away. 
Troy watches her go just as... ...Lionel passes by. 
The two share an awkward glance before Troy turns to enter the house. 53 INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER HALL - SAME TIME 53 Lionel shyly trudges down the hall of Armstrong / Parker. 
He turns to see Troy behind him. 
The two avoid the other's gaze. 
As they both head up the stairs, Troy notes it strange that they're headed in the same direction. 53A UPSTAIRS 53A Lionel heads to a door at the end of the hallway and opens it with a key. 
Troy's already at the door when he looks up and realizes Lionel's just entered his apartment. 54 INT. TROY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 54 TROY The hell are you doing? 
LIONEL & TROY This is my apartment. 
TROY The hell it is. 
LIONEL The Dean said it was the only opening. 
TROY Head of House doesn't share. 61. 
LIONEL But you're not Head of House. 
Still stings. 
Troy heads into his room and closes the door leaving Lionel alone in the living room. 57 INT. ARMSTRONG/PARKER DINING HALL - DAY 57 Lionel sits alone in front of another bowl of soup. 
Eyes the different cliques of mostly Black students. 
Dreads walks past and shoots a head nod. 
Lionel uncomfortably shoots one back. 
DREADS Stay Black, my brother. 
LIONEL Sure thing? 
Lionel watches as Kurt and Troy walk together towards the entrance - suddenly chums. 
Troy's getting good news and gladly shakes Kurt's hand. 
KURT Need your submission by Thursday. 
TROY You got it bro. 
The two try and enter, when immediately Dreads slams a GONG in the back of the hall - prompting the whole of the dining hall to turn and throw paper balls at Kurt. 
KURT The fuck? 
Sam grins from a table comprised of Martin, Sungmi and her other support staff. 
Martin is visibly annoyed. 
TROY Yo! Troy takes some of the brunt of this and walks with the humiliated Kurt back out of the Dining Hall. 
Lionel watches with a smirk as Troy talks Kurt down on the other side of the entrance. 
Lionel catches eyes with Sam briefly who shares the same smirk. 
He realizes Sam's actually looking at Reggie, perched behind him at a table flanked by Curls and Dreads. 
They address him. 
REGGIE Finally made it in. 62. 
DREADS Been moved around a lot right? 
CURLS You must have been terrified when you saw "Armstrong/Parker" written on your moving assignment. 
LIONEL I was just finishing up. 
REGGIE Do Black people scare you? 
LIONEL (realizing its true) No. REGGIE You're too scared to even ask anyone for a cut. 
LIONEL I'm growing it out. 
DREADS No. I'm growing it out. 
You're fostering an ecosystem. 
REGGIE How come you don't come to BSU? LIONEL I listen to Mumford and Sons and watch Robert Altman movies. 
You honestly think I'm Black enough for the union? 
DREADS Yo, I love Robert Altman. 
Mutha fucka goes in. 
CURLS (after a beat) We're not all homophobes you know. 
Black folks? 
Lionel's eyes dart around. 
How did she know? 
DREADS I'm bumping Frank Ocean right now. 
I don't give a fuck. 
Imma still eat at Chik Fil A though. 
Them nuggets good as hell. 63. 
LIONEL I'm late for class. 
REGGIE You're the "Black voice" of the Bugle now. 
We're just trying to decide if you are friend or foe. 
Reggie pulls a folded copy of the Bugle from under his arm. 
Sam's on the front page with the headline "WHITE STUDENTS TOLD TO `GET OUT' BY LIONEL HIGGINS." REGGIE (CONT'D) We got to protect our girl. 
Reggie motions over to a stressed out Sam as she argues over something with Martin at another table. 
LIONEL I'm not on staff. 
Not until I make good on my assignment, I'm just -- REGGIE -- Assignment? 
What's the story? 
LIONEL They want me to do a profile piece on Black culture at Manchester. 
REGGIE Of which you are so clearly an expert. 
Shame floods Lionel's face. 
REGGIE (CONT'D) So what's harder man? 
Being Black enough for the Black kids or the white ones? 
LIONEL Being neither. 
Another GONG sounds with another shower of paper balls. 
This time it's for... ...Gabe, who's stuck outside. 
He makes eye contact with... 
GABE Sam! Really Sam? 
She just looks away. 
Reggie eyes him coolly. 64. 58 INT. CLASSROOM - DAY 58 Professor Bodkin watches over a small class as the students fill in essay questions. 
Sam's eyes are glued to a window... 
Outside below the Brofros pull up in an SUV. They hop out and start pulling out rally signs and bullhorns. 
Sam's eyes dart back to the clock as Gabe watches her watch the time. 59A EXT. MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY - DAY 59A Sam bounds out of a building on her way to the parking lot. 
From behind her... 
DEAN FAIRBANKS Running late. 
Sam pauses and turns to see him. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT'D) For your little rally? 
SAM Forget your sign Dean? 
DEAN FAIRBANKS Do you honestly think this is in the spirit of Armstrong / Parker house? 
SAM The role of the counter culture is to wake up the mainstream to -- DEAN FAIRBANKS -- I've got furniture older than you. 
Counter culture? 
Is that what you think this is? 
That show of yours? 
SAM What about my show? 
DEAN FAIRBANKS Your show is racist. 
SAM Black people can't be racist. 
The Dean is rendered speechless at this statement. 65. 
SAM (CONT'D) Prejudice? 
Yes. 
But not racist. 
Racism describes a system of disadvantage based on race. 
Black people can't be racist since they don't benefit from such a system. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS Do you read the school papers? 
SAM Is the New York Times a school paper? 
DEAN FAIRBANKS Your antics are making press Sam and press like this keeps men like President Fletcher up at night. 
SAM Warm milk? 
DEAN FAIRBANKS He's building a file on you. 
SAM It's not my fault your son couldn't beat me in an election. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS I'm sure it was hard growing up. 
Wondering which side you fit into. 
Feeling like you have to overcompensate perhaps? 
SAM If that's true, I'm not the only one Dean. 
Sam walks off in a half jog - Fairbank's last words resonate more than she'd like. 
Gabe, making his way outside just catches her exit. 59B EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY 59B Huge canvas signs with the words "WHITES ONLY" are strewn about the pavement, along with bullhorns and picket signs. 
Sam takes these in while the Brofros feverishly unpack the SUV. 66. 
REGGIE There you are! We supposed to start at noon. 
SAM I told you I had class. 
There's a vibration in Sam's pocket. 
Her phone says "MOM." She cuts it off and picks up a "white's only" sign. 
REGGIE Those are going up on Gillespie. 
Good right? 
Sam shrugs in the affirmative but it's too much. 
Reggie sees a doubt in her eyes. 
REGGIE (CONT'D) Yo. What's that? 
You're not getting cold feet are you? 
SAM No. I mean how long do I have to talk anyway? 
REGGIE You're kidding right? 
You're sort of the keynote. 
SAM Yeah but...you know I think the whole Malcolm X thing is your lane Reg. 
I'm just not -- REGGIE -- They came to hear you Sam. 
Grab a bullhorn. 
Turn it on. 
Sam is struck by the command. 
Stuck between wanting to curse and comply another buzz in her pocket yanks her attention to her phone. 
Sam checks: "IT'S ABOUT DAD. CALL ME" Sam turns for some privacy. 
She makes eye contact with Gabe who's just happened upon the parking lot. 
GABE What is all this? 
SAM (on phone) Hey. 
In the middle of-- -- Okay. 
Okay. 
Okay. 67. 
Tears well up in Sam's eyes as she shakes her head no and heads away from the parking lot and passed Gabe. 
When Reggie looks up and catches eyes with Sam. 
His tilted look of indignation asks her what she's doing. 
REGGIE Sam? 
Sam takes in the scene and decisively turns to go. 
Reggie's heart sinks as a bewildered Gabe goes to chase after her. 
REGGIE (CONT'D) Sam! 60 INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER HALL - DAY 60 Reggie flanked by the BoFros bangs on Sam's door. 
REGGIE Yo, what the hell Sam? 61 INT. SAM'S ROOM - DAY 61 The banging continues as Sam sits on the edge of her bed. 
The tears have dried. 
Gabe paces behind the bed. 
GABE You want me to tell them to go? 
SAM You're so tough. 
GABE I will. 
SAM I want you to wait until they've gone and then head home. 
GABE I'm trying to be here for you. 
SAM Can you be somewhere else for me? 61A HALLWAY 61A REGGIE Sam! I know you're home. 68. 61B SAM'S ROOM 61B GABE What do you see in him? 
SAM The only eligible single brother on campus. 
GABE Wow. 
Okay. 
SAM I get it. 
Your parents owned in Harlem or something? 
You watched "Do The Right Thing" in high school and you want to prove to the world you're down? 
GABE I want to be down? 
How long does it take to get your hair like that? 
REGGIE (O.S.) Sam. 
We want to talk. 
SAM Reggie I will call you later damn! (to Gabe) You don't know what you're talking about. 
Girls like me-- GABE --what? 
Have to pick a side? 
I'm sick of your tragic Mulatto bullshit Sam! SAM You can't say Mulatto. 
GABE Mulatto! Mulatto! Mulatto! MORE BANGING SAM Window. 
Go out the window. 
GABE I'm sorry if I can't be your Nubian prince on my Black horse ready to take you back to fucking Zamunda! 69. 
SAM That's not a real African country. 
GABE Can I please get some credit for a solid "Coming to America" reference? 
Sam tries not laugh at this. 
GABE (CONT'D) This isn't you Sam. 
SAM No? And who am I? 
GABE You're this...girl... 
SAM Perceptive. 
GABE Who...likes to argue with me about every fucking thing. 
And I hate it because we both know you're smarter than me. 
Your favorite director is Bergman, but you tell people its Spike Lee. 
You love bebop, but you've got a thing for Taylor Swift. 
I know because my Mac picks up your Mac's library. 
SAM And I was so careful... 
GABE You like to use phrases from the thirties and wear clothes from the fifties and hairstyles from the sixties. 
You like to watch me when you think I'm sleeping. 
And trace the outlines of my face. 
Sam fights any signs of this moving her. 
Another BANG. GABE (CONT'D) You're more "Banksy" than "Barack" but you've been co-opted as some sort of revolutionary leader or something? 
But really you're an anarchist. 
A beautiful writer, artist, filmmaker, shit starter. 
And beautiful, in general. 70. 
Sam's heart beats through her chest. 
Her phone rings: "Mom." SAM Yeah? 
Yeah? 
Yeah. 
It's okay. 
Get some sleep. 
Sam hangs up. 
A silence hangs - followed by a loud EXHALE from Sam as she let's go of the tension she'd been holding. 
GABE Everything okay? 
SAM (happy tears) His condition's stable. 
GABE Good. 
That's good Sam. 
Gabe goes to exit just as Reggie BANGS again. 
SAM Gabe! Gabe opens the door to the very shocked Bofros and Reggie... 
GABE What!? ...and brushes right past them. 
Sam gets up and stares down the heartbroken looks on her disciples' faces. 
SAM I'm sorry. 
And with that she closes the door right on Reggie. 62 EXT. ELLINGTON TERRACE - NIGHT 62 Coco and Helmut look out over the campus from the glowing terrace atop the Library. 
They sip on coffee's. 
HELMUT New videos are picking up steam. 
COCO Told you I was good TV. HELMUT The show I'm scouting for... 
It's called Black Face / White Place. 
It's reality. 
Like a "True Life." Each episode centers on a different one of "us" in a sea of "them." 71. 
COCO Interesting. 
HELMUT Interesting? 
You think they want interesting? 
Dignified stories of triumph and survival? (off Coco's naive shrug) They want the "authentic urban experience" which is basically network talk for bitching and weave snatching. 
I'm telling you this because the network is looking to take one of the subjects to series. 
I got one episode. 
One shot to find that subject. 
So if we do this... 
COCO ...we do it all the way. 
I'm guessing Sam turned you down. 
HELMUT I think so. 
She called me a Bojangling Oofta, whatever that means. 
Everything else she said would've been bleeped on tv. (off Coco's laugh) So look, forty thousand hits on Youtube is good. 
It's not great. 
COCO I'm about to get a whole lot more. 63 INT. KURT'S HOUSE - DAY 63 Coco sits before a video camera. 
The room is dim. 
KURT We don't have anyone like you on staff and you had a great idea. 
We brought you here to -- COCO -- I want to MC it. 
Your party. 
KURT We're here to tell you what we want. 
COCO You want me and in order to get me, you have to let me MC. (MORE) 72. 
COCO (CONT'D) And I want to do a live video blog from my Youtube account. 
BACK TO: 64 EXT. ELLINGTON TERRACE - DAY 64 HELMUT They'd let you do that? 
COCO They got no choice. 
They need me -- BACK TO: 65 INT. KURT'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 65 COCO -- cause without me ya'll look like a bunch of privileged assholes. 
KURT We don't let people video blog our events... 
COCO ...You got a week to put this thing together boo boo. 
What's it going to be? 
CUT TO: 66 EXT. ELLINGTON TERRACE - DAY 66 Helmut looks at Coco with a shocked gleam in his eye. 
COCO You look surprised. 
HELMUT It's just... 67 INT. TROY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 67 Troy and Lionel both type furiously at their computers in their rooms. 
Troy on his invite - Lionel on his article. 
They each look at the other in alternate intervals. 
HELMUT (V.O.) ...not everyone is as camera ready as you. 67A LIONEL'S ROOM 67A 73. 
Lionel pauses the episode of STAR TREK THE NEXT GENERATION on his TV and heads to... 67B KITCHEN 67B ...bar divide. 
Pours a bowl of cereal. 
He glances into Troy's room. 
He's also got Star Trek on. 
Could it be? 
Troy, feels Lionel's eyes on him and quickly switches it to Basketball. 67C TROY'S ROOM 67C Troy types in "KURT FLETCHER" in the "To" field and "PASTICHE SUBMISSION" in the subject field. 
He hits "send" and swallows the lump in his throat. 68 INT. DEANS OFFICE - DAY 68 Troy gingerly enters into the Dean's office. 
Martin and Dean Fairbanks talk in hushed tones around Fairbanks' desk. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS Martin, would you share with Troy what you shared with me? 
MARTIN The server that processes the voting results for House Elections has shut down the A.P. database. 
Saw it this morning. 
Apparently the intermediary program is on a refractile loop. 
TROY I'm a Poly Sci major man. 
MARTIN Sam currently has 445 votes. 
That's 200 more than she had last week during the actual election. 
TROY There's not even that many residents in Armstrong / Parker. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS She cheated. 
Hacked the system. 69 INT. PRESIDENT'S OFFICE - DAY 69 Sam sits before a giant fireplace - twice as large as the Dean's. 
She faces President Fletcher and fights nerves. 74. 
SAM I wouldn't even begin to know how to do something like that. 
PRESIDENT FLETCHER Is your little war really this important? 
Sam shifts gears slightly - he wants something from her. 
PRESIDENT FLETCHER (CONT'D) I understand the pressure to stand for something at an institution like this but you're barking up the wrong tree okay? 70 INT. DEAN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 70 MARTIN Had to have been Reggie. 
Dude's in my programing class. 
Good. 
Just forgot to turn his program off. 
TROY Wow. 
MARTIN You're the rightful Head of House. 
TROY (shit) So great. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS Martin, let me talk to Troy for a bit. 
I appreciate this. 71 INT. PRESIDENT'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 71 Sam glares at Fletcher. 
PRESIDENT FLETCHER Your advisor tells me you're hanging on by a thread in you major. 
Perhaps it's time to reprioritize. 
SAM You're trying to frighten me, but I think you're the one who's scared. 75. 
PRESIDENT FLETCHER And I think you long for the days where Blacks were hanging from trees and denied actual rights. 
Then you'd actually have something to fight against. 
A swell of emotion behind Sam's steel eyes. 
PRESIDENT FLETCHER (CONT'D) You will be facing two hearings in the coming weeks that could end in either Probation or Suspension. 
One on the merits of your show, the other on your election to Head of House. 
Sam is truly scared by this. 
PRESIDENT FLETCHER (CONT'D) Your responsibilities to your house are suspended. 
Your show is done for. 
And another one of your illegal "demonstrations" will only make matters worse. 
This is a critical time for this school. 
SAM You damn right it is. 
PRESIDENT FLETCHER We don't have an intolerance problem here. 
Except for the one I'm looking at. 72 INT. DEAN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 72 Troy and his father are alone. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS You didn't tell me you and Sofia had a misunderstanding. 
TROY Who did? 
DEAN FAIRBANKS Her father. 
She was very upset. (off Troy's silence) Troy. 
What sort of vision do you have for yourself? 76. 
TROY Get my degree. 
Then Law School and then -- DEAN FAIRBANKS --And what's that got to do with partying with Kurt? 
With smoking weed and writing jokes? 
Panic flashes over Troy. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT'D) Okay, so what? 
Is it the spotlight Kurt gets? 
You want to be on...tv or something? 
You know how many Black men waste their lives to get on TV? Be rappers and ball players? 
TROY (wanting it to be true) Dad no. 
I want what we always talked about. 
Maybe have my own firm someday? 
Run for office. 
Make a difference. 
Wife. 
Kids. 
I want all that. 
I really really do. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS And the drugs? 
God damn it Troy I taught you better than this. 
I have been in academia a long time, I've seen a lot of things. 
The men who really run this world? 
You got no idea what they see when they see you. 
You are not going to be what they all think you are. 
You will not give them that satisfaction, you hear me? 
TROY Yes sir. 73 INT. PRESIDENT'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 73 Sam steps out of Fletcher's office into the waiting room. 
Kurt is there. 
He stands and the two silently stare the other down as Kurt enters his father's office. 
A SECRETARY picks up a ringing phone - prompts her to exit the room. 
Sam watches her sign for a delivery outside through the window. 
Sam slips behind the office door - quietly pushes it open and listens in. 77. 
PRESIDENT FLETCHER I know about the party. 
You picked a hell of a time. 
KURT What party -- PRESIDENT FLETCHER -- You're cancelling Kurt. 
End of story. 75 INT. BULLPEN - DAY 75 Lionel walks through the empty office - slows down as he over hears... 
GEORGE (O.S.) Lionel's story on the would-be protest outside of Gillespie is running tomorrow and I'm also having Lionel work on a profile piece of Armstrong/Parker like you suggested. 
Really break down what's going on. 
Lionel gingerly approaches the door to see George finish up a phone call. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) Right. 
It's almost like they recycle so much from their past - Music, food, fashion, and now turbulence. 
This leaves a bitter taste in Lionel's mouth. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) Thank you so much. 
Okay, take care. 
George can't fight his grin as he looks to Annie. 
ANNIE Well? 
GEORGE That was our Times advisor. 
He said it's stories like these that get editors recommendation letters. 
Lionel knocks on the door. 
Annie and George are startled but reassured when they see who it is. 78. 
LIONEL The Negro at the door didn't scare you this time. 
Annie smiles and heads for the door. 
ANNIE Lionel please. 
You're only technically Black. 
G, going to French. 
You want me to hold your seat? 
GEORGE Thanks. 
Annie smiles and walks out. 
LIONEL You need something? 
Saw your e- mail. 
GEORGE Yeah, I need someone to do the Donor's function on Saturday. 
Small dinner for the school's big givers. 
Administration wants a little coverage. 
LIONEL That's Halloween night. 
GEORGE Right, which is why no one else will take it. 
LIONEL Ah. Thus the new guy. 
George gathers his backpack and walks over to Lionel. 
Gets close. 
GEORGE On my way to class, but you can stay and check out last year's piece. 
You'll do fine. 
LIONEL I don't know. 
Are there going to be any racially fueled outbursts at this thing? 
GEORGE Never know right? 79. 
It's clear Lionel wants to say something else. 
George too. 
LIONEL Am I a good writer? 
GEORGE You'll get better. 
And we need you right now. 
LIONEL You're just a big recommendation away from landing the Times. 
GEORGE God I hope so. 
Lionel looks down. 
He is being used. 
Turns to go, just as -- GEORGE (CONT'D) Hey. -- George grabs Lionel unsure what he wants to say. 
So instead he just kisses him. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) I'm glad we finally got that Bugle on your chest. 
Lionel's all mixed up. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) There's a big party the night of the Donor's event. 
Call me after, maybe we can hang? 
LIONEL Yeah. 
Sounds good. 
George heads out - leaving Lionel perplexed. 76 INT. TROY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 76 Troy stares at his reflection in a mirror as he lifts his du- rag to reveal his perfectly curled finger waves. 
He's getting ready for something. 
His phone buzzes with a notification: "Message from: PASTICHE" Troy nervously clicks it open. 
As he reads... 80. 
KURT (V.O.) Dear White People. 
Are you tired of your hum drum, Wonderbread existence of accidental racism and wishing you could sip on Henny out yo crunk cup without a Bitch giving you the side-eye? 
Course you are. 
MONTAGE: As our subjects get ready for their evening. 
Troy goes back to combing over his finger waves, finding and correcting imperceptible imperfections. 
KURT (V.O.) For all those looking to unleash their inner Negro from years of bondage and oppression Pastiche proudly presents "Dear White People" our 89th annual Hallow's Eve Costume Party - tonight at 10 Pacific Time or 5 Colored People Time. 
Sorry for the short notice, but let's keep it one hun-ed. 
You've had us on your calendar for weeks. 76A Lionel stares into a mirror in an ill fitting suit 76A combing out his unwieldy fro. 
He flinches in pain as he fluffs out each section. 
KURT (V.O.) Dudes must rock FUBU, Ecko, Rocawear, or Sean John. 
XXXL is the smallest size T-Shirt you can wear, preferably with a collage of Barack Obama and Tupac on it. 
Stunner Shades, chains, and Blue-Tooth devices sticking out yo ears are also encouraged. 76B Coco pulls a blonde curly wig over her natural hair. 
She 76B smooths her tendrils to frame her face, almost pale with foundation. 
She begins on her eyes. 
KURT (V.O.) Ladies, we need to see huge hoop earrings, long nails, and cheap tight clothes. (MORE) 81. 
KURT (V.O.) (CONT'D) A proper hood rat starts fights, speaks loudly, and when she can't think of the word she's trying to say just makes one up, such as "edumicated." Feel free to fry up some chicken, bring Kool-Aid, Watermelon, 40s, Henny, and of course Dat Purple Drank. 
No bougie bitches allowed. 76C Sam removes the pins and the black power Afro pic holding 76C up her pompadour fro hair-do, and lets it fall flat around her ears. 
She takes in her image in the mirror. 
KURT (V.O.) Naturally there will be a freestyle rap competition so bring it, get yo shine on and join us for the party of the year! Oh and Nigga Nigga Nigga Nigga. 
Boy that felt good. 77 EXT. GILLESPIE HALL - NIGHT 77 Laughter and music from the well to do event wafts outside while Troy dressed in a slick Armani tux hangs by the entrance. 
He smokes on Coco's one-hitter from before. 
Lionel steps out in his ill fitted suit, a camera in hand. 
The two are surprised to see each other. 
LIONEL Funny seeing you here. 
TROY Father likes to show me off at all the Donor functions. 
The dessert course is usually my cue to take a breather while they talk shop. (friendlier) The trick is to dazzle them into forking over their estates just before they kick the bucket. 
Lionel could just leave. 
Instead he accepts the olive branch. 
LIONEL So...Picard or Kirk? 
TROY Kirk. 
Wait... 
LIONEL I saw you watching Star -- 82. 
TROY -- Yo what happens in the crib stays in the crib. 
Not trying to get my card revoked. 
LIONEL Hey, some could argue that a show with Whoopi Goldberg, Michael Dorn and Kunta Kinte himself is a pretty Black show. 
TROY Yeah? 
That work out for you? 
LIONEL No. No it did not. 
At least not in High School. 
I bet there's a statue of you at your High School. 
TROY I was beloved. 
Won't lie. 
LIONEL Did they know you were a trekker? 
TROY My pops left a paint by numbers template for success at that High School. 
All I had to do was fill in the blanks. 
Football captain. 
Valedictorian. 
Prom King. 
Lionel sees a sadness in Troy. 
TROY (CONT'D) So what? 
You're growing that out? 
LIONEL I think it's gaining sentience. 
TROY It's...out there. 
LIONEL It's like a black hole for white people's fingers. 
They're obsessed. 
TROY You know I cut hair. 
Why didn't you ask me? 
LIONEL You're I dunno...you? 83. 
Behind Lionel, George and Annie pass by the steps to Gillespie. 
GEORGE Li! You ready man? 
LIONEL No costumes? 
I got a tux for this. 
ANNIE We just got out of the staff room. 
GEORGE Yeah, we're going as overworked. 
LIONEL Where is it? 
ANNIE Garmin House. 
On third I think? 
LIONEL Third and Basin. 
I know it. 
Before Lionel jets to join them. 
TROY Yo man. 
If I'd gone to your High School, I'd have had your back. 
Lionel smiles and heads after his new friends. 78 EXT. KURT'S HOUSE - NIGHT 78 Lionel pauses before his old home - now filled with the chaos of a wild party. 
Lionel clears his throat and heads in. 79 INT. KURT'S HOUSE - NIGHT 79 The party is dark and rambunctious. 
Lots of white kids in costume. 
Some as fairies or ninjas or Spiderman - but most as pimps and thugs. 
As Blaxploitation characters. 
As Barack Obama and Condi Rice. 
As Shaft, Ice Cube, and 2 Chainz. 
It's a lot for Lionel. 
Cups are handed to them filled with "Purple Drank." Everyone downs the stuff. 
INT. GILLESPIE HALL - NIGHT Troy is being appreciated by an ancient COUPLE. TROY ...my own firm. 
Maybe run for office. 
Make a difference you know? 84. 
The couple smile. 
A buzz draws Troy's eyes to his phone - photos from "Dear White People" pop up in his news feed. 80 INT. KURT'S HOUSE - NIGHT 80 Lionel watches as Gordon and other Pastiche crew nervously put up flyers and posters. 
They seem caught off guard. 
Lionel glances at the posters - it's Kurt with a large Afro wig mimicking Sam's "Missing Black Culture" flyers. 
LIONEL This is kind of fucked up. 
Right? 
GEORGE Pastiche. 
The world's most erudite boneheads. 
Who wants another round? 
Come on Lionel, help a brother out. 
LIONEL Kitchen's this way. 80A ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS 80A Coco enters the party - blinged out like Nicki Minaj. 
She's feeling herself as she's handed a drink. 
She's got eyes on her - for the first time like this at a party. 
But she sees the same thing Lionel saw. 
Her confidence starts to fight a shame that creeps up beneath her party face. 
She switches her iPhone to video mode... 
COCO Hey there muffins. 
How do I look? 
Why are white folks so obsessed with being Black? 
And why are Black folks so addicted to Blonde Barbie doll weaves? 
Honeys it's a strange symbiosis we're here to explore... 
Coco's voice cracks as she stares into her own image on her iPhone. 
She pauses it and takes a breath. 80B HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 80B Lionel leads George through the dense crowd towards the kitchen - George pulls Lionel into a hallway and into... 80C BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 80C ...the bathroom and up against the door. 
George inhales Lionel's lips. 
Runs his fingers through Lionel's hair. 85. 
LIONEL Ouch. 
GEORGE Sorry. 
LIONEL It's okay. 
Can't wait to cut all this off. 
GEORGE Don't you dare. 
George plunges his fingers into Lionel's fro once again. 
Pulls a touch too hard. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) I could eat you like a Hershey's. 
This sets something off in Lionel. 
LIONEL I'll be right back. 
Lionel breaks George's grasp and heads out the bathroom... 
LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS ...and back out into the party. 
He's trapped in a nightmare of caricatures and reveling students. 
Can't breathe. 
EXT. KURT'S HOUSE - NIGHT Lionel squeezes his way outside. 
Something goes off in his head as he starts walking away from the party. 
Just then Kurt arrives in front of the house with some friends. 
Looks at Lionel then at the house. 
KURT What the hell? 81 INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER - NIGHT 81 Lionel paces the halls. 
His mind churns as he passes the dining hall. 
Sam and Reggie are engaged in something intense. 
DINING HALL SAM For a genius dude you're a fucking idiot. 86. 
REGGIE I did it, we did it for you. 
SAM I didn't ask for it Reggie. 
I look like I betrayed this house. 
REGGIE Yeah? 
Well you betrayed me. 
Sam gets up and storms out - brushes past Lionel. 
LIONEL Sam? 
Can we talk? 
Sam turns back around fiercely. 82 INT. KURT'S HOUSE - NIGHT 82 A turntable is uncovered and rolled out - as a DUDE DRESSED LIKE SERENA WILLIAMS starts up a MYSTIKAL record. 
The crowd starts to get live now. 
Coco continues to make her way through the party - her face visibly perturbed by the time she reaches the kitchen. 
She continues out back... 83 EXT. KURT'S BACKYARD - NIGHT 83 ...and sits pulling out a cigarette. 
She sees Annie put on a long straight Black wig and brag to friends... 
ANNIE Hey who am I? "Bitch it's weave. 
Noun. 
Present tense ho!" Right in the gut. 
She's playing Coco. 
Coco grabs her phone... 84 INT. KURT'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 84 Kurt stumbles about the party in a daze. 
Drunk? 
Folks give him props while he searches for and spots Gordon with the others. 
His phone rings. 
KURT Yeah? 
INTERCUT COCO Kurt, it's me. 
I can't do this. 87. 
KURT Okay, I'm fucking confused. 85 INT. SAM'S ROOM - NIGHT 85 Lionel sits across from Sam. 
SAM What do you want me to do? 
Go over there and yell at them? 
LIONEL Have you heard you yelling? 
SAM This house is filled with folks willing to take up after a cause Lionel. 
Believe me. 
Never would have guessed you'd be one of them but... 
LIONEL For the first time in my life, I can't just sit around and do nothing. 
How can you? 
SAM If I'm caught being a part of anything like this...it wouldn't be good for me right now okay? 
Lionel gets up and walks towards the door. 
SAM (CONT'D) I'm done being everybody's angry Black chick. 
Sam looks down as Lionel gets up and heads out. 
Sam's focus shifts to her Super 8 resting by the door and then to a bullhorn directly across from it. 
Her mind ticks. 86 INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER HALL - NIGHT 86 Lionel exits and paces down the hall. 
He walks by the dining room - taken over by Reggie, the BoFros, and a mix of other students mostly from ARMSTRONG / PARKER. 86A DINING HALL - CONTINUOUS 86A Lionel gingerly walks in the room. 
He's still an outsider here - but something's changed in him. 88. 
LIONEL Hey. 
How's it going. 
Hi. No one answers him - just stay to their own conversations. 
Lionel spots a familiar face...Sungmi. 
LIONEL (CONT'D) Hey...what is this? 
SUNGMI Black Student Union. 
Lionel smiles shyly. 
He should've known that. 
Reggie, Curls, Dreads and the Bofros hang out at the front. 
DREADS Your call then man. 
REGGIE (to everyone) Alright ya'll - thanks for coming out tonight. 
Looks like Sam's not making it so...let's just call it. 
The crowd starts to talk amongst themselves, get up and leave. 
Just then Lionel stands and before he can think... 
LIONEL Uh. Excuse me. 
Hi. I'm Lionel. 
Some of you...none of you probably know me. 
I've never been to a meeting. 
But I just came back from a party on campus and I think you should know about it. 
Lionel's nerves can be heard in his voice now. 
He's got the judging eyes of the room fixed silently on him. 
He sees an open laptop on a desk. 
LIONEL (CONT'D) Anybody mind if I? 
Reggie shifts a bit as Lionel goes to the laptop and pulls up the party on Facebook. 
The crowd gathers around as Lionel browses through the photos. 
LIONEL (CONT'D) I mean...I don't know. 
This is fucked up right? 
REGGIE Alright brother. 
What's the plan? 89. 
Lionel realizes the eyes aren't judging. 
They're mobilizing. 
Readying for action. 
Lionel steels himself. 
LIONEL We go over there. 
Now. 
CURLS Think there's enough of us? 
SUNGMI You know you don't have a monopoly on being a pissed off minority. 
Latino's United is meeting across the hall. 
Asian American League too. (off the stares) You guys got better snacks. 87 INT. GILLESPIE HALL - NIGHT 87 Troy scrolls through an endless amount of Facebook uploads from the party. 
Forties, bad Afro wigs, fake asses. 
Shoved in between two RICH OLD WELL TO DOS at a long table covered in empty plates and glasses - Troy looks across to his father, in mid exaggerated guffaw with President Fletcher. 
TROY Dad... 
DEAN FAIRBANKS Not now Troy. 
TROY It's important. 
There's something happening on campus. 
I might've... 
DEAN FAIRBANKS You're being rude son. 
Dean Fairbanks turns away. 
Troy ponders a moment and then-- TROY Oh am I? 
How about I tell your precious donors and anyone here who'll listen about the kind of a school it is they're giving to? 
The Dean can feel the eyes of the Donors and the President on him - an outrage comes over him as he pulls Troy aside. 90. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS I don't know who you think you are young man but you don't get to talk to your father any kind of way. 
TROY All I say to you is yes sir and no sir! Look I should've brought this up before but -- (off Fairbanks dismissal) -- listen to me! Dean Fairbanks tries to cover this moment with a smile. 88 INT. KURT'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 88 Kurt, still dazed, huddles with his core Pastiche group. 
KURT What? 
GORDON Yeah dude. 
We all got it. 
I mean, everything's cool right? 
A noise in the other room startles them... 88A LIVING ROOM 88A ...It's Reggie who knocks over a bowl of chips. 
Dreads argues with a few people. 
Martin rips shades off a kid's face. 
The party swarms with BSU kids and their Latino / Asian allies. 
A SMASH yanks Kurt's attention back to the kitchen... 88B KITCHEN 88B ...where Lionel smashes bottles of liquor in the sink. 
KURT Lionel? 
Kurt yanks the booze from Lionel and shoves him. 
KURT (CONT'D) The fuck you think you're doing man? 
Lionel shoves Kurt into the bar divide. 
A few of the BSU kids flood into the kitchen and hold Kurt back. 
KURT (CONT'D) That all you got? 91. 
LIONEL We're putting an end to this Kurt. 
KURT Fuck you I'm calling the cops. 
MARTIN Half of this crowd is under 21. 
A loud AMP sound alerts everyone to the DJ platform in the Living Room. 88C LIVING ROOM 88C Mitch has taken over the mic. 
MITCH Gimme that mic Before I slap ya Looking for some dykes, that wanna another chapta. 
If you do me slow, you can do me faster, I'll pass you to the Nigga on my right, he gets you after. 
LIONEL Kurt-- KURT -- Why don't you tuck your tail between your legs, run and tell the Dean and get the fuck out. 
Lionel sinks from this attack while his posse from BSU watches helplessly as the party goes back into full swing. 
Lionel turns to go and spots... ...George who joins Annie, fresh beer in hand. 
But right behind George is... ...Sam, having just arrived with her camera in hand pointed at the rap battle. 
She winks at Lionel. 
Lionel turns around - summons something from deep inside. 
Lionel steps onto the DJ platform and snatches the mic out of one of the rapper's hands. 
LIONEL Heyyyy! Hoooo! Heyyy! Hooo! 92. 
The crowd is with it - thinks it's part of the show as Lionel proceeds to freestyle terribly... 
LIONEL (CONT'D) My name is Lionel, Some people call me Li. Lots of people think that I talk kinda white. 
Well that's alright. 
Yeah that's cool. 
I'd rather you think I'm white, than tap dance for you. 
With that Lionel takes the mic and SMASHES it on the wall. 
He then takes the turntable by his hands and flips it over. 
Sparks fly - the amp goes crazy - the crowd is in shock. 
Lionel grabs a speaker tower and slams it to the ground. 
Lionel's off the platform now. 
Kurt grabs him - Reggie pushes Kurt away in his defense. 
Gordon grabs Reggie - A FIGHT BREAKS OUT. More equipment is slammed to the ground and stomped on as the party disintegrates into chaos. 
Sam dodges fights to capture it all with the camera. 
Art is being ripped from the walls. 
Dishes being smashed on the ground. 
Arguments come to physical blows. 
The steel in Sam's gaze fades. 
Replaced by...heartbreak? 
And then she spots... ...Coco squeezing her way through the crowd for the door. 
Sam's camera and mic stay trained on Coco. 
COCO What? 
Say it. 
Come on. 
Sam stays silent. 
COCO (CONT'D) This may come as a shock, but these people don't give a fuck about no Harriet muthafuckin Tubman. 
They pay millions of dollars on their tans, their lips, their asses, Jay- Z tickets, you name it, cause they wanna be us. (MORE) 93. 
COCO (CONT'D) So they got to be for a night.I'm not about to go out into the streets in protest of a Halloween party. 
Sam keeps her mouth shut and her camera rolling as Coco realizes it's herself she's trying to convince. 
Coco storms off. 
Sam exhales and lowers her camera. 
This is new for her. 
Keeping her mouth shut. 89 EXT. KURT'S HOUSE - NIGHT 89 Coco trudges down the side walk - yanks off her hair, her lashes, her bling - shedding the shame of the night. 90 EXT. KURT'S YARD - NIGHT 90 Kurt hustles Lionel out into the yard. 
Kurt shoves him to the ground. 
KURT Dude. 
I know you can't help it... 
Lionel just gets back up again only to be slammed down. 
KURT (CONT'D) ...but why are you such a fag dude? 
Lionel spits in Kurt's face and pops right back up again. 
We see it in his eyes - he'll never give up. 
Kurt's hand is on Lionel's collar. 
He pushes him down again. 
Kids are all around - some from the BSU - some from Pastiche - some from the Bugle. 
Everyone holds an opposite party back. 
Lionel looks over at his audience and then into Kurt's eyes. 
Lionel leans in and kisses Kurt on the mouth long and hard. 
LIONEL Finally got me where you want me. 
Kurt's in shock. 
He looks at his crew who laugh at him. 
Lionel sees the surprise in the eyes of his new supporters as well. 
No time to soak this in though. 
Kurt's let up. 
For a moment. 
Lionel turns back to Kurt and PUNCHES him in the face. 
The BSU kids go CRAZY in support. 
The shock gone - Kurt damn near knocks Lionel out. 
The world goes all slow motion and out of focus. 
Lionel sort of makes out that Kurt is yanked off him. 94. 
Kids run in different directions - Flashlights fill the yard - One is shone directly on Lionel. 
CAMPUS SAFETY GUARDS and a couple POLICE OFFICERS surround him. 91 INT. KURT'S HOUSE - NIGHT 91 The motor on Sam's Super 8 ticks away. 
The party is at a complete standstill. 
Troy enters and looks around in disbelief. 
Makes eye contact with Kurt who is being held by a Campus Safety Officer. 
Dean Fairbanks enters and stands in the middle of the chaos. 
Sam tip toes in for a close up and holds out a small mic. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS What is all this? 92 INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT 92 A SERIES OF SHOTS FROM A MOVIE BEING PROJECTED ON A SCREEN We see the Dean looking about the party with disappointment. 
CUT TO: 92A KURT looking bewildered outside his house after the 92A party. 
We hear BOOS from a crowd. 
The carnage is devastating. 
Windows are blown out - trash and destroyed furniture on the lawn. 
Ash where fires were put out. 
KURT I didn't do this. 
Sam. 
I had nothing to do with this. 
CUT TO: 92B MORNING NEWS 92B ANCHOR What some are calling a "race war" has erupted at one of the nation's oldest and most prestigious -- CUT TO: 92 GILLESPIE FORUM now filled with students who sit before 92 Dean Fairbanks and President Fletcher for a Town Hall. 
Everyone wears a look of outrage. 95. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS We don't condone this egregious event and are investigating its origins. 
The president and I are looking at ways to address issues of Diversity at Manchester. 
REGGIE HOUSING REFORM! Applause breaks out amongst the crowd. 
But so do boos. 
CUT TO: 93 VARIOUS SPOTS AROUND CAMPUS. Students address the camera. 93 MITCH I'm sorry but it's bullshit. 
Yo this is how we get down. 
If you can't take a joke in this day and age? 
The fact we can joke about it proves we've moved on you feel me? 
This is an attack on free speech! We're the victims here! CUT TO: 93A A series of Busts have been PAINTED IN BLACK FACE outside 93A of Armstrong / Parker where Lionel address the camera... 
LIONEL It's hard enough for us to even get into a school like this. 
Let alone succeed. 
Find our way. 
This is only a debate because of who Kurt's dad is, which just proves the point. 
All you did was have a radio show and look what happened to you. 
CUT TO: 93B COCO as she talks directly to camera. 93B COCO I know this may come as a shock, but nobody gives a fuck about no Harriet muthafuckin Tubman...they wanna be us. 
So they got to be for a night. 
CUT TO: 96. 93C A POSTER featuring Troy rendered like the famous Shepard 93C Fairy Obama posters with the words "A NEW HOPE" written at the bottom as well as "TROY BROUSSARD FOR PRESIDENT." This gets some more applause from the crowd watching. 
TROY Of course I got my dad involved. 
It was the right thing to do. 
I didn't mean for all this to happen. 
All the posters and everything. 
SAM (O.S.) But you'd welcome it? 
A shot for school president. 
TROY I think...I'd make more than few people happy if I ran. 
CUT TO: 93D RADIO BOOTH - where Sam puts her headphones on. 
She 93D lingers. 
SAM (V.O.) Even though I'd been expressly forbidden to do so, I wanted to do one last show. 
Something to sum up the moment. 
To savor in the pop of the post racial bubble just burst. 
SAM Dear White People... 
SAM (V.O.) I wanted to react. 
Sam takes in a thoughtful breath before... 
SAM ...Know what? 
Nevermind. 
She fades in a melancholy piece of Be-Bop before hanging her headpones up as the title on the projected movie fades in: "...BLACK FACES BY SAMANTHA WHITE" Sam stares nervously at the screen as the lights come on, when all at once the room BREAKS INTO APPLAUSE. Sam turns to see that the entire room is on it's feet including Prof Bodkin and Gabe. 97. 94 INT. DEAN'S OFFICE - DAY 94 Dean Fairbanks loosens his tie, flanked by several SCHOOL OFFICIALS. They've been here for hours listening to... 
KURT Once I heard what the group was planning, I sent out an email to the staff to cancel it. 
You have the email printed in front of you. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS Who's this? 
Kurt turns to a SUITED MAN next to him. 
KURT My lawyer. 
CUT TO: 94B We'll be cross cutting between several of these sessions. 94B COCO So when I got the invite and saw everyone clicking "yes" I figured it was back on. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS You were hoping to make the staff? 
COCO ... 
CUT TO: DEAN FAIRBANKS At what point in time did you show up to the event? 94C Sam sits with arms folded. 94C DEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT'D) Samantha. 
Please. 
SAM Why am I even here? 
CUT TO: KURT 94 Guys throw parties at the house all 94 the time. 98. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS We know you were planning this. 
KURT Your son tell you that? 
CUT TO: 94D Fairbanks stares down his son. 
Troy is silent and anxious. 94D DEAN FAIRBANKS (reading) "...wishing you could sip on Henny out yo crunk cup without a Bitch giving you the side-eye?" (and then) You write this Troy? 
Troy looks up at his father embarrassed. 
TROY No. Mine wasn't chosen. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS But you wanted to be? 
TROY What I wanted didn't matter then. 
Why should it matter now? 
I told you about the party, remember? 
CUT TO: DEAN FAIRBANKS 94 The invite came from the Pastiche 94 Facebook account. 
KURT I loathe Facebook. 
An OFFICIAL whispers something in Fairbanks' ear. 
KURT (CONT'D) You've got to believe me. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS You've used that line on me before this year Mr. Fletcher. 
When a homophobic message mysteriously appeared on a voice mail line you shared with a roommate. 
CUT TO: 99. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT'D) What were your intentions when you went back the second time? 
LIONEL To stop it. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS By any means necessary? 
LIONEL Someone once told me...Manchester is like jazz. 
I don't know much about jazz. 
But from what I can tell, when your solo's up, you better blow. 
Fairbanks fights a smile. 
CUT TO: 94C SAM 94C All I did that night was hit record brother. 
The Dean takes a gulp from a glass of water. 
He stands and looks out his huge windows onto the campus below. 
CUT TO: 94E The Dean has Facebook opened on his computer. 
Officials 94E are taking a break. 
Drinking water. 
Discussing the day. 
The Dean tries a few passwords. 
CUT TO: 94C DEAN FAIRBANKS 94C Want to hear something strange? 
The Dean turns from the window. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT'D) The Pastiche group page hadn't been used for months, until the invite went out. 
CUT TO: 94E The Dean tries a different password. 
Still invalid. 94E CUT TO: 100. 94C SAM 94C Fascinating. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS Well what's interesting is how easy it was to access the group before the note was sent. 
The password was "Pa$tiche" spelled with a dollar sign according to Kurt. 
Seems recently it's been changed. 
CUT TO: 94E The Dean tries one more. 
It works. 94E CUT TO: 94C DEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT'D) 94C Couldn't figure it out at first. 
Then I thought to try something. 
Five, seven, eight, three, five, twenty six, one, nine, four, six. 
Eleven numbers. 
Just like our student ID numbers. 
Just like your student ID number. 
SAM As much as you hate him, you will stop at nothing to protect your master and his boy. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS Did you send out the invite Sam? 
SAM That invite, whoever sent it should've been met with derision and outrage. 
Instead, a hundred people showed up and they pulled out posters and decorations and costumes they'd made for just such an occasion. 
Sam and Dean Fairbanks at a stalemate. 
Silence falls in the room. 
The Dean's mind ticks. 95 EXT. MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY - DAY 95 A pack of EMERALD BUGLE newspapers hit the stand with the headline: "INVESTIGATION INCONCLUSIVE! FLETCHER GOES FREE. NO EXPULSIONS MADE" 101. 
Next to it is another stack of papers from the INDEPENDENT OBSERVER. The headline reads: "EBONY & IVY: CAN THERE BE HARMONY? BY LIONEL HIGGINS." George picks up a copy of the Observer and starts to read... 96 INT. TROY AND LIONEL'S APARTMENT - DAY 96 Lionel flips through his own article as well. 
A satisfied grin on his face as a razor makes its way through his hair. 
LIONEL 2 Chainz? 
Shaft? 
While endless complex depictions of whites, white men in particular exist - there aren't that many versions of us in the culture. 
His locks waft towards the ground as Troy styles a fresh and fearless fro-hawk atop Lionel's head. 
LIONEL (CONT'D) Culture has a powerful way of telling people what they can and can't be. 
For people of color the options are rather limited. 
TROY Next James Baldwin up in here. 
Wait hold on a sec. 
Star Trek is back from commercial break. 
Troy and Lionel watch in silence. 97 EXT. MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY - DAY 97 Gabe is just about finished with Lionel's article too. 
Looks up just in time to see... 
GABE Hello Sam. 
Sam sneers at his formalities. 
GABE (CONT'D) Read about Armstrong / Parker. 
SAM Yeah. 
Prez made an executive withdrawal. 
Armstrong stays Black. 
GABE Congrats? 102. 
SAM (with a shrug) Getting too dramatic man. 
Thinking about getting an apartment off campus. 
We'll see. 
GABE Sam going against the grain? 
Shocked. 
How's papa White? 
SAM He's recovering. 
GABE Good. 
Well... 
Gabe fights the urge to hug her. 
SAM We were actually on the phone last night for hours. 
First time we talked since the bypass. 
He was putting up a strong front. 
Teasing me about being so worried. 
Then came the stories about me as a little girl I'd heard a thousand times. 
About how independent I was. 
Gabe smiles politely. 
Senses she needs a moment. 
GABE Want to talk about it? 
SAM My mother worked nights so he would take me to school. 
And it pissed me off because he would follow me all the way to homeroom. 
Every time he tried to hold my hand I'd scream and pull away. 
He thought I was just being...difficult. 
A hint of recognition in Gabe. 
Is this about them? 
SAM (CONT'D) But it was the kids. 
And the parents and the teachers. 
They'd see this Black girl and this white man and wonder what we were doing together. 
Even at nine I could feel their eyes on me. 
Especially at nine. 
It brought tears to my eyes. 
Gabe's stone face melts at this. 103. 
SAM (CONT'D) I was just a bratty girl, didn't know any better but-- The thought of losing him-- You know? 
I just feel so bad. 
How awful am I to do that to him? 
To anyone I love? 
Gabe gets it. 
This is an explanation. 
An apology, to him. 
His arm is on her shoulder now. 
GABE I'm sure he forgives you. 
SAM Think so? 
Gabe nods. 
Sam's normal defenses come back up lest she cries. 
SAM (CONT'D) So anyway. 
I didn't mean to say all of that. 
I don't know why I did. 
GABE Sam. 
Where are you going? 
SAM I don't know. 
Lunch? 
Gabe starts to walk with her. 
GABE Isn't it Mac and Cheese day at Armstrong/Parker? 
SAM Think they'll let you in? 
Gabe smiles. 
They walk a bit. 
Then he grabs her hand. 
Sam lets the moment happen. 
Squeezes his back. 
They look into each others' eyes. 
Don't even notice as Reggie and the Bofros pass them by. 98 INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 98 Coco sits across from Helmut. 
He's got his eyes on a Youtube clip from Sam's movie featuring Coco. 
COCO (YOUTUBE) I know this may come as a shock, but they don't give a fuck about no Harriet muthafuckin Tubman... 104. 
HELMUT Two hundred thousand views. 
Look they even auto-tuned it. 
With a click Helmut pulls it up. 
AUTOTUNED COCO (YOUTUBE) Muthafuckin Tubman! Muthatfuckin Tubman! Don't give a fuck about no muthafuckin Tubman! Coco's not sure what to think. 
HELMUT Couple months, that's how long shooting for an episode takes. 
We recommend you cut your course load in half to accommodate the schedule. 
COCO Half? 
HELMUT Trust me it it'll read "full-time" in the episode. 
If...once we go to series, we might have to figure out a summer schedule. 
COCO For shooting? 
HELMUT For uh...classes and stuff. 
Won't be graduating early anymore sweetheart. 
Helmut shifts a contract over to Coco. 
HELMUT (CONT'D) Five grand for the episode. 
Twenty each if you get picked up for series. 
What do you say? 
Coco stares at the contract and back at Helmut. 
HELMUT (CONT'D) Trust me sweetie it's the same out there as it is in here. 
Good news is? 
Against all that damn white you and I? 
We pop. 
Think I wanted to be the go-to producer for all things Black? 105. 
Coco shrugs. 
HELMUT (CONT'D) Tell you what's worse though. 
Being that broke Nigga stuck on the south side of Chicago. 
Hundred and Fiftieth street. 
Coco takes a deep breath. 
Stares right into his eyes -- 99 EXT. MANCHESTER - DAY 99 Coco exits a building and spots Troy up ahead. 
He's flanked by his former enemies turned supporters, Reggie and the other BoFros. 
They all carry Troy's "New Hope" posters. 
COCO Made some new friends? 
Troy shrugs as Coco grabs for his hand. 
He pulls away and shares a glance with Reggie, who doesn't approve. 
COCO (CONT'D) Fine. 
TROY Come on Coco. 
COCO Fuck you. 
Coco starts to walk ahead. 
TROY My dad saw your videos. 
He's a little worried about -- COCO -- how it'll look. 
With your campaign and all. 
What's your best friend Reggie think? 
Troy motions for Reggie to go on ahead. 
TROY We had fun, alright? 
COCO I get everyone else wants you to win Troy. 
But do you? 
Troy doesn't know how to answer that. 
He stares at the triumphant, winning version of himself on his poster. 106. 
Coco's eyes shift longingly as she walks ahead - unsure of who she is at the moment and who she will be in the next. 
Watching her is Lionel and Sam - sitting with Gabe and Sungmi. 
They both know that look well... 
SAM Hey Lionel. 
With me out and Troy moving on - A/P's going to need a new head of house. 
LIONEL Think there's a story there? 
Who do you think it'll be? 
Sam and Sungmi share a glance and stare right at Lionel. 
LIONEL (CONT'D) What? 
No. SUNGMI Everyone loves you. 
Won't be hard to rally the vote. 
SAM Yeah. 
We got you man. 
Lionel takes in this moment. 
One of complete acceptance. 100 INT. FLETCHERS OFFICE - DAY 100 Fairbanks turns from the window in Fletcher's office to join him at his desk. 
They're all ears as they look across to... 
HELMUT Let me get this straight. 
First you tried to break up the Black house. 
Then you took down the sister with the little radio show. 
And after all that, your kid throws a Blackface party? 
FLETCHER Now wait a minute! HELMUT You thought you were having money problems before? 
Wait till cable gets their hands on this story. 
Bill Maher is gon' fuck you up! FLETCHER I have heard enough -- 107. 
HELMUT -- Wait I'm sorry. 
Look from where I'm sitting this place is a goldmine. 
DEAN FAIRBANKS What? 
HELMUT For one we got to show the events that led up to the party -- DEAN FAIRBANKS -- That already happened. 
HELMUT Well yeah, but we can reenact -- DEAN FAIRBANKS -- reenact? 
HELMUT Documentary term...Look, I can start putting together an overall deal today. 
I'm talking real money! Turns out the one thing America likes in it's reality more than ignant Black folks, is crazy racist White people! DEAN FAIRBANKS Now you look here. 
This is an honorable institution. 
The idea that we would so much as entertain this suggestion -- Fletcher holds his hand up. 
His turn to speak. 
FLETCHER How much we talking? 
Fairbanks' outrage turns to resignation as Helmut, the one winner here smiles. 
Dollar signs in his eyes. 
THE END
FOXCATCHER Written by E. 
Max Frye & Dan Futterman INT. UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN GYM - VERY EARLY MORNING MARK SCHULTZ (27, 180 lbs., cauliflower ears) lifts a human- sized, leather WRESTLING DUMMY from the mat to stand in front of him. 
He performs a series of repetitive moves - hooking one arm under the dummy's arm, then the other; one side, then other. 
Again and again. 
It looks almost as if he's dancing gently with it. 
Then, very fast, Mark spins quickly around behind the dummy, grabs it in a bear hug, arches his back, lifts and SLAMS it to the mat, landing on top. 
QUICK CUTS: Mark spinning, lifting and slamming the dummy - first one way, then the other - first one hold, then another - SLAM. SLAM. SLAM. SLAM. SLAM - over and over and over again. 
CUT TO: I/E. 
BARABOO SCHOOL/PARKING LOT - LATE MORNING Mark pulls his beat-up car into a space in the parking lot of this nondescript, 1960s-era suburban brick-facade school. 
He's freshly showered, wears a short-sleeve dress shirt, clip- on tie, slacks. 
He reaches behind the front seat and pulls out a battered BROWN VINYL BRIEFCASE. CUT TO: INT. BARABOO SCHOOL/PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE WAITING ROOM - DAY Mark waits alone in a chair he's much too big for, his brown vinyl briefcase on his lap. 
A portrait of President Reagan hangs on the painted cinder block wall. 
A clock ticks. 
CUT TO: INT. BARABOO SCHOOL/AUDITORIUM - DAY Mark's on stage. 
An audience of 4th, 5th and 6th graders. 
MARK Why do I do it? 
Why do I push myself to my limits - of pain, of exhaustion - every day of my life? 
Why do I wake up every morning and make the commitment? 
Why do I do it? 2. 
The students are open-mouthed - they have no idea what to make of him. 
Mark's not being willfully over-the-top with these kids. 
This is just what's on his mind. 
All the time. 
MARK (CONT'D) In 13 months - if I train right, if I push myself - I'll be going to Seoul - that's a city in South Korea. 
Does anyone know why? 
Because that's where the Olympic games are. 
Mark reaches into the briefcase at his feet and pulls out a RIBBON with a MEDAL dangling from it. 
MARK (CONT'D) Does anyone know what this is? 
As a couple of kids start to raise their hands -- MARK (CONT'D) Olympic gold medal. 
I won it three years ago at the `84 Games in Los Angeles. 
My brother, Dave Schultz - my best friend, my older brother, my best friend - won one too, just 23 hours and 16 minutes before I did. 
That's unprecedented - two brothers winning at the same Olympics. (THEN) Would you like me to win another one? 
Would you like me to win another gold medal - for us, for America? 
Would you like to see me and my big brother - Dave Schultz - both win gold medals? 
Who here wants to see the two brothers win again? 
Silence. 
A couple of the kids tentatively raise their hands. 
The rest are completely frozen. 
MARK (CONT'D) Well we're going to give it absolutely everything we've got. 
CUT TO: INT. BARABOO SCHOOL/PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE WAITING ROOM - DAY A SCHOOL SECRETARY writes out a check as Mark stands in front of the desk, placing his medal back in his briefcase. 3. 
SCHOOL SECRETARY Twenty... and... no one-hundreds... 
She tears off the check and hands it to Mark. 
He takes the check, holds out to her a SIGNED 8x10 PHOTO of himself with his arms raised, in a USA WRESTLING SINGLET just after winning his Olympic gold. 
MARK And this is for the trophy case. 
SCHOOL SECRETARY I'm sorry?... 
For what? 
MARK For the trophy case. (BEAT) With the trophies. 
SCHOOL SECRETARY It's an elementary school. 
As Mark holds out the photo, WE HEAR: FAST FOOD KID (V.O.) Can I take your order? 
CUT TO: INT. ARBY'S - DAY A long-haired, greasy KID with the very beginnings of a mustache takes Mark's order. 
Mark looks up at the menu sign. 
MARK I'll have a # 4. 
FAST FOOD KID # 4. 
Anything to drink? 
MARK No. Can I get extra meat on that? 
FAST FOOD KID 65 cents. 
MARK What are you talking about? 
FAST FOOD KID Extra meat costs extra. 4. 
MARK Where's it say that? 
FAST FOOD KID I don't know. 
I just know I'm supposed to charge extra for extra meat. 
MARK I always get extra meat. 
Every time I come here. 
FAST FOOD KID It's extra for extra meat. 
They told me. 65 cents. 
CUT TO: I/E. 
MARK'S FORD STATION WAGON/ ARBY'S PARKING LOT - DAY Mark sits in his car, eating his sandwich - no enjoyment, just fueling himself. 
His RADIO plays a commercial. 
CUT TO: INT. UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN GYM - AFTERNOON DAVE SCHULTZ (31, bearded, intelligent, 163 lbs., strong, fierce, but calm), Head Coach of U of W wrestling, stands on the wrestling mat speaking VERY QUIETLY with 3 or 4 select WRESTLERS from the team. 
We can't quite hear what Dave is saying to them, but we can sense immediately the reverence and deep respect they have for Dave - one of the country's top wrestlers and great coaches. 
The scene gives off the feeling one might have watching a horse whisperer with a small group of stallions. 
Whatever he's saying, they are calmed by him, pay absolute attention, will do whatever he asks. 
CUT TO: INT. MARK'S APARTMENT - EVENING A cheaply built 70s-era structure, where Mark inhabits two small rooms with a cheap kitchenette built into the wall of one of them. 
A particle-board BOOKCASE houses a little SHRINE of Mark's medals - and PHOTOS of him and Dave. 
Mark retrieves his briefcase from inside the garbage bag and extracts his GOLD MEDAL. 5. 
He replaces it in the PLASTIC DISPLAY CASE on the top shelf, next to the photo of him and Dave smiling with their gold medals around their necks. 
CUT TO: INT. MARK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT Mark dumps a package of TOP RAMEN NOODLES into boiling water. 
And another package. 
And another. 
CUT TO: INT. MARK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT Mark sits on his one metal FOLDING CHAIR, at his table, eating his bowl of noodles. 
Moths tap against the window. 
CUT TO: INT. MARK'S APARTMENT/BEDROOM - LATER/NIGHT Mark, in just boxer shorts, crosses off another day on his wall calendar. 427 days to Seoul. 
He looks around, then drops to the floor and starts a monstrous number of push-ups. 
CUT TO: EXT. INDUSTRIAL ROAD - EARLY MORNING Mark runs hard past warehouses and auto repair outlets. 
CUT TO: EXT. FIELD AND HILL NEXT TO CAR DEMOLITION YARD - MORNING Mark runs through knee-high weeds dragging a CAR TIRE attached to a rope behind him. 
He reaches a hill and heads straight up, dragging the tire all the way - MARK (V.O.) Coach Teller? 
This is Mark Schultz-- CUT TO: 6. 
INT. MARK'S APARTMENT - DAY An ink-stained directory of Wisconsin Public Schools lies open on the kitchen table. 
MARK (ON PHONE) I won a freestyle wrestling gold medal at the `84 Olympics. 
Mark, the phone tucked against his shoulder, slips a BLANK TAPE into a cheap VCR. He slides a HAND-LABELED TAPE into a second VCR, wired to the first. 
We can read the label: "THE MARK SCHULTZ WRESTLING CLINIC." He starts making a copy. 
MARK (ON PHONE) (CONT'D) I'm arranging a clinic in your area next weekend, and I wanted to invite you and some of your wrestlers to join... 
JUMP CUT TO: MARK (ON PHONE) (CONT'D) That's Dave, my brother. 
I wrestle at 180... 
No, he won't be there, just me... 
Okay - well, good luck with your season, coach. 
JUMP TO: On the screen is a montage of highlights from Mark's career: take downs, pins. 
He's an animal - powerful, aggressive. 
MARK (ON PHONE) (CONT'D) Yes, there's a small fee. 
JUMP TO: MARK (ON PHONE) (CONT'D) S-C-H-U-L-T-Z.... 
JUMP TO: On the screen, Mark wrestles Resit Karabajak, a Turkish wrestler, in his first round match at the `84 Olympics. 
MARK (ON PHONE) (CONT'D) A unique, character-building opportunity for young wrestlers.... 
Yes, a small fee... 
Mark throws Karabajak to the mat. 
Pins him. 
Walks away, arms raised. 
Crowd cheers. 
Karabajak's on the mat, hurt. 7. 
MARK (ON PHONE) (CONT'D) Dave's my brother... 
On screen, Mark does a back flip. 
JUMP TO: MARK (ON PHONE) (CONT'D) Olympic Champion... 
Mark does a back flip. 
MARK (ON PHONE) (CONT'D) Dave's my brother... 
JUMP TO: Mark's holds the phone on his lap, just watching himself on the screen, wrestling... winning... match after match... 
EXT. MARK'S APARTMENT/OUTSIDE WALKWAY - EVENING Mark's outside at the second floor railing of this two-story stucco building, looking out over the bleak landscape: a 7- 11, an Auto-Zone. 
He eats a hard-boiled egg. 
He watches a CAR pull into the lot below. 
Dave gets out, looks up. 
DAVE Where were you today? 
CUT TO: INT. MARK'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER Dave fills two mismatched glasses with tap water from the faucet. 
DAVE How far'd you run? 
Ten? 
Mark's on the tattered couch. 
He shrugs, though we should see that he loves the fact that Dave is concerned about him. 
DAVE (CONT'D) More than ten? 
Dragging weight the whole way? (Dave turns off the water) You're a sick fuck, you know that? 
Dave turns to look at Mark, sitting in the bare living room. 8. 
DAVE (CONT'D) Place is looking good, by the way. 
I like what you've done with it. 
Dave notices the Public Schools Directory on the table. 
DAVE (CONT'D) You setting up clinics? 
MARK Talked to some coaches. 
Dave comes toward Mark, handing off a water glass, dragging the folding chair over to sit across from him. 
DAVE I hope you don't have anything booked for Saturday. 
MARK Why? 
DAVE I need a favor. 
This school called me months ago to do a gig but now I can't. 
Nancy's got a thing all day so I gotta watch the kids. 
You free? 
MARK I'll check. 
He goes into the bedroom, looks at the calendar. 
There's NOTHING WRITTEN DOWN for any of the days. 
MARK (CONT'D) You said Saturday or Sunday? 
DAVE Saturday. 
MARK Saturday could work. 
He comes back in. 
DAVE Good. 
Thank you. 
Dave looks at the BACK OF HIS HAND, where he's written down a name and phone number in MARKER. He grabs one of Mark's VHS labels and a pen and writes the information. 9. 
DAVE (CONT'D) Coach Vinson, Radnor High. 
I'll let him know you'll call tomorrow. 
He peels off the label and slaps it on Mark's leg. 
DAVE (CONT'D) And Mark. 
Please come back to the gym. 
You don't have to do anything with the team. 
Just train with me. 
Mark's just looking at his older brother. 
DAVE (CONT'D) I need you there. 
Stay focused on what's important. 
For both of us. 
Seoul's the goal. 
Beat. 
Beat. 
Then, Mark nods at his brother. 
MARK Seoul's the goal. 
CUT TO: INT. RADNOR HIGH SCHOOL GYM - DAY Seven HIGH SCHOOL BOYS plus a couple of PRE-TEENS, all in wrestling gear, sit on the mat in front of Mark. 
He seems manic, evangelical, not tuned into his audience. 
MARK The minute you step on the mat, you are exactly who you are. 
You can't hide. 
You can't pretend you trained harder than you did, you want it more than you do. 
My brother Dave and me care about this more than we care about anything. 
The difference between the number one guy in the world and the number four guy is paper thin. 
The one who wins is the one who wants it more, who's willing to sacrifice, who can take the pain. 
I can take the pain. 
My brother Dave can take the pain. 
Can you take the pain? 
Blank looks from the teenage wrestlers. 
Mark gestures to a table set up near the door, on which is his OPEN BRIEFCASE, with a stack of TAPES. 10. 
MARK (CONT'D) I talk about all this in my instructional videotape - which you can purchase at the end of the day for a nominal fee. 
CUT TO: INT. UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN GYM - DAY Mark exits the locker room in his wrestling gear, heading for the MATS. Dave's in his wrestling gear, on the far side of the gym, talking with TWO MIDDLE-AGED MEN in blazers with USA WRESTLING INSIGNIA. Mark walks onto the mat, waits for him. 
Dave and the two men see Mark, WAVE to him - but Mark pretends not to notice, busies himself loosening his wrists, hands, neck. 
Dave walks over to him. 
DAVE You remember Fred Cole from USA Wrestling. 
The men walk up behind Dave. 
FRED COLE Hey there, Mark, how you been? 
Mark sort of nods, but doesn't really respond. 
FRED COLE (CONT'D) (beat, then turns to Dave) All right, Dave. 
Let us know if we can count on you. 
We'll talk soon. 
Dave nods. 
They walk away. 
Then Dave turns back to Mark. 
MARK You been calling me and hanging up? 
DAVE (adjusting his knee brace) No. What do you mean? 
Mark doesn't answer, just stands looking at him. 
For several seconds, they look at each other. 
Then, slowly at first: They start to circle each other. 
We sense immediately their differences: Dave's hunched and not very muscular physique belies his quickness and enormous strength. 11. 
Mark's defining characteristic is brute force. 
A weight class heavier than Dave, he can NEVER SEEM TO BEAT HIS OLDER BROTHER. The wrestling becomes intense and violent - Mark's head slams into Dave's nose, drawing BLOOD. This only energizes Dave, who slams Mark to the mat - dripping blood onto him. 
VARIOUS SHOTS of the increasingly brutal match, ending with: Dave rides Mark, who's on his stomach, flattened and splayed - grappling for a hold. 
Mark glances up to SEE: The USA Wrestling men WATCHING from near the door. 
Mark looks away, gritting his teeth, but Dave's gotten his hold. 
As Dave TURNS and slams the bigger Mark - CUT TO: INT. DAVE'S CAR/OUTSIDE MARK'S APARTMENT - EVENING Mark looks out the window. 
Silence. 
They sit there, both bruised and bloodied. 
MARK Sorry about your nose. 
DAVE No, you're not. (BEAT) Come by the house, have dinner with me and Nance and the kids. 
Mark's still looking out the window. 
He speaks quietly - MARK You win a gold medal for them. 
And still. 
Nothing. 
No respect. 
He reaches for the door handle. 
DAVE Hey. 
Gimme a hug. 
Dave reaches for his arm, and Mark folds automatically into his older brother, puts his head on his chest. 
Dave embraces him for several long moments - it's like a father and his young child. 
Then Dave smacks him on the back of the neck. 
DAVE (CONT'D) Same time tomorrow. 12. 
Mark nods, gets out of the car and walks away. 
CUT TO: INT. MARK'S APARTMENT - EVENING Mark presses PLAY on his answering machine. 
Hang-ups and DIAL TONES. CUT TO: INT. MARK'S APARTMENT/BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER Mark examines his bruised face in the mirror, wiping away blood - some of it his, some his brother's. 
CUT TO: INT. MARK'S APARTMENT - LATER Mark's at the refrigerator, cracking ice cube trays into a plastic 7-11 shopping bag. 
The PHONE RINGS. He picks up -- MARK (ON PHONE) Yah. 
A man's voice is heard. 
It sounds like long distance. 
MAN (OVER PHONE) May I please speak with Mr. Mark Schultz? 
MARK (ON PHONE) It's Mark. 
MAN (OVER PHONE) I'm sorry to call you at night, but Mr. du Pont was anxious that I get in touch with you. 
MARK (ON PHONE) Okay... 
MAN (ON PHONE) He asked that you please consider taking a day off from your training to come out to Foxcatcher Farms so you men can meet face to face. 
MARK (ON PHONE) Who do you work for again? 13. 
MAN (ON PHONE) John E. du Pont of the du Pont family of Newtown Square, Pennsylvania. (BEAT) You may also know of him in connection with his support of the Villanova wrestling program. 
MARK (ON PHONE) (HE DOESN'T) What does he want to talk about? 
MAN (ON PHONE) Mr. du Pont requested that I contact you to set up a meeting. 
He'd like to bring you out to Pennsylvania. 
MARK (ON PHONE) Uh-huh. 
MAN (ON PHONE) If I may I'd like to make travel arrangements for you, Mr. Schultz. 
Mark's holding the ice cube tray, alone in his dingy kitchen. 
MAN (ON PHONE) (CONT'D) Mr. Schultz? 
CUT TO: INT. PHL AIRPORT/ARRIVAL GATE - DAY BRANDON (20s, post-prep school, jacket/tie) waits for Mark. 
BRANDON Mr. Schultz, I'm Brandon. 
Welcome to Philadelphia. 
CUT TO: INT. HELICOPTER (AIRBORNE) - DAY Mark watches out the clear Plexi as the Pennsylvania countryside spreads out below him. 
He and Brandon and the pilot (LARRY - 50s, aviator glasses, Air Cavalry patch on his jacket) all wear RADIO MIC HEADSETS. 14. 
BRANDON (ON RADIO MIC) Mr. du Pont would have flown you himself, but he was asked at the last minute for tactical assistance by the Newtown Square Police Department. 
Mark has no idea what that means, but nods his head. 
BRANDON (ON RADIO MIC) (CONT'D) He should be back at the estate by the time we get there. 
Larry BANKS the plane steeply on Mark's side so Mark has an unobstructed view of the ground. 
LARRY (ON RADIO MIC) Valley Forge below you. 
They speed over the historic site - wide fields, the memorial arch, wood fences, the old stone house. 
BRANDON (ON RADIO MIC) The du Pont family's supplied American armed forces with gunpowder since the beginning. (as Larry heads south) Foxcatcher in three minutes. 
CUT TO: I/E. 
HELICOPTER (AIRBORNE)/FOXCATCHER ESTATE - MINUTES LATER A MARE and FOAL run away as the helicopter descends toward the Big House - a huge Georgian brick home in the middle of 800 acres of fields and woods and outbuildings. 
CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY/BIG HOUSE - DAY Brandon leads Mark down a carpeted hallway. 
CUT TO: INT. LIBRARY/BIG HOUSE - DAY They enter. 
It's at once grandly elegant and musty. 15. 
BRANDON Feel free to look around the library. 
Mr. du Pont will be up shortly. 
Shuts the door behind him. 
Mark's never been in a room like this - oil paintings of du Pont ancestors; foxhounds, horses, hunts. 
Leather-bound books share space with framed OLD STAMPS and antique (and not so antique) PISTOLS. Framed PHOTOS of the same man (JOHN DU PONT - 50, thin, beak-nosed, blond-grey hair) with Presidents Ford, Nixon, Reagan... 
Henry Kissinger. 
Mark's standing, gazing at the photos, when the door opens, revealing JOHN DU PONT, a police-issue HOLSTER dangling from one hand. 
He stops and breathlessly regards Mark. 
DU PONT You're actually here. 
MARK Oh. Yes, sir. 
DU PONT In my study. 
MARK (no idea what to say) They said it was the library. 
DU PONT It is. 
Du Pont puts the holster onto a chair. 
Holds out his hand. 
DU PONT (CONT'D) John du Pont. 
MARK Mark Sch -- DU PONT - I know who you are - I've watched your Olympic victory enough times to know exactly who you are, every inch of you. 
Please, put your bag down, make yourself comfortable, sit, make yourself at home - (You quickly realize that du Pont can be voluble and charming, but the more time you spend with him, the more you see what an effort this is for him - how essentially uncomfortable he is in his own skin.... 
Also, he just might have snorted a tiny bit of coke before he came in.) 16. 
Mark sits. 
Du Pont settles in, sits facing him - focused entirely on Mark. 
He speaks intimately, sincerely DU PONT (CONT'D) I watched the video of your Olympic run again last night. 
After you broke the arm of the Turk - after they disqualified you, handed you a loss - after they put an extra official on you to watch your holds - all of which were legal - after all that you rack up seven straight wins to take the medal. 
For your country. 
Thrilling. 
Thrilling. 
Inspiring. 
Take the gold medal. 
Mark can't recall when he's received this kind of attention. 
MARK Thank you, sir. 
I'm proud of that day. 
DU PONT You should be. 
I'm proud of that day. 
I'm proud of you on that day. 
Your parents must be enormously proud. 
MARK (after a moment) To be perfectly honest, we don't often talk. 
Du Pont nods, hoping Mark might say more. 
When he doesn't - DU PONT I want to tell you how much I appreciate your coming here. 
I know it cuts into your training. 
I imagine that's every day for you? 
MARK Yes sir, it is. 
DU PONT Strength training in the morning? 
Upper body regimen - muscle tone - building up the muscle tone - across the upper body. 
In the morning? 17. 
MARK Oh. Well. 
I take the mornings on my own - as you said, strength training, endurance - then I meet up with my brother - you know Dave Schultz - ? 
DU PONT Of course, of course, yes, I know him. 
I mean, not personally, but yes, of course, I do know him. 
MARK - I meet up with him at the U-W gym, we work out whatever free time we can grab between team practice. 
DU PONT University of Wisconsin. 
MARK Yes sir. 
DU PONT Where you both coach. 
Mark NODS vaguely. 
DU PONT (CONT'D) And they provide you with everything you need? 
Beat. 
MARK Pretty much. 
A moment as du Pont watches Mark. 
DU PONT I'd like to see you win this upcoming tournament - MARK - Thank you - DU PONT - I'd like to help you win this upcoming tournament. 
It's a big one, yes? 
MARK It's the world championship. 18. 
Du Pont nods. 
DU PONT Why do you do it, Mark? 
Mark just looks at him, unsure what he's being asked. 
DU PONT (CONT'D) Why? 
MARK (simply no other reason) I want to be the best in the world. 
DU PONT I want you to be the best in the world. 
I want this country to be the best in the world. (THEN) May I speak frankly? 
Mark nods... of course. 
DU PONT (CONT'D) I'm concerned. 
I'm concerned by what I see in these Unites States. 
Athletes labor to bring honor to America, and America fails to honor that labor. 
Fails to honor it and fails to support it. 
Mark's staring at du Pont intently. 
DU PONT (CONT'D) When did you win your first match? 
MARK I started kind of late - high school sophomore. 
Du Pont waits, listening... 
MARK (CONT'D) I was... well, truthfully, I was... kind of lost. 
And I got into it `cause my brother was wrestling. 
He convinced me to give it a try. 
I never told him this, but I was scared of losing in front of him. 
So of course my first match I get put up against a kid two years older. 
Dave was helping coach from my corner... and at the end, when the ref raised my hand... (MORE) 19. 
MARK (CONT'D) there was my brother, he was running towards me - screaming - laughing - he lifted me up -- Mark stops - face flushed - tries to stop himself from getting CHOKED UP. After a few moments, he speaks quietly: MARK (CONT'D) It's always been his sport. 
He let me inside. 
I'm just lucky to be very very good at it. 
DU PONT You won that match. 
Not him. 
CUT TO: EXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE - DAY Du Pont and Mark walk the last few steps of a huge lawn up to an OLD FIELD HOUSE in the final stages of renovation. 
Du Pont opens the door. 
They walk into a gleaming new GYM. CUT TO: INT. FOXCATCHER GYM - CONTINUOUS Four pristine WRESTLING MATS are spread out on the floor. 
Through a doorway on the far end we can glimpse a WEIGHT ROOM with new nautilus and stationary bikes and free weights. 
DU PONT The U.S. 
Olympic Committee refuses to recognize that training for international competition is a full time job. 
Why is that? 
Why is that? (looks at Mark) I want you all to have a home. 
CUT TO: EXT. VALLEY FORGE - LATE AFTERNOON VARIOUS SHOTS of the vast historic site - monuments and fences and stone house headquarters. 
DU PONT (V.O.) I wish every American could come here and see for themselves. 
See the price of freedom. 
It's not free at all. 20. 
Mark stands next to John on a ridge over the CEMETERY field. 
Du Pont's front leg is poised on a large rock, as if he's a General surveying all that has been conquered. 
His black Ford Mercury is parked nearby. 
DU PONT The sacrifices of the troops that first long winter remind me of what you athletes go through. 
Silence as they look out over the national park. 
DU PONT (CONT'D) I'm gratified my family could play a small part in the history here. 
Then du Pont speaks, as much to Mark as to himself - DU PONT (CONT'D) We can't choose the family we're born to. 
But we can make our own. (BEAT) I can't think of anyone I'd rather build a team with. (turns to Mark) You name your price. 
CUT TO: EXT. PHL AIRPORT - ESTABLISHING/DAY A plane takes off on the runway. 
CUT TO: INT. PHL AIRPORT/BATHROOM - DAY CLOSE UP on Mark's face, looking at himself in the mirror. 
Studying his own face. 
Then he erupts in a PRIMAL SCREAM. CUT TO: EXT. PINE TREE - DAY CLOSE UP on the face of a SIX-YEAR OLD BOY, CRYING - terrified. 
ALEXANDER, Dave's son. 
He's mid-way up a tall pine tree and scared to go any higher. 
Dave is a couple of branches above him. 
He looks down at Alexander, patiently waiting for the boy to stop crying. 
Finally, ALEX stops. 21. 
DAVE You ready? 
Beat. 
The boy nods. 
They climb higher. 
CUT TO: I/E. 
TAXI/MADISON/DAVE'S STREET - DAY Mark rides in the back of a cab. 
As he nears Dave's house, we SEE Nancy tapping a beer keg in the side yard. 
Dave and Alex sit in the TOP OF THE TREE, watching Mark arrive. 
CUT TO: EXT. DAVE'S HOUSE - LATER/DAY Lots of U of W wrestlers, coaches, wives, girlfriends, kids. 
Dave's at the BBQ, carving a huge roast on a spit with a long CARVING KNIFE. Mark's talking to him - MARK 25 thousand a year. 
He said name your price and I said the highest price that came into my head. 
We'd get to hand-pick our own team, wrestlers we want to work with - DAVE Who you gonna train with? 
MARK No - I mean... when I say we, I mean - you and me... could choose a team. 
Together. 
DAVE What does du Pont get out of it? 
MARK As soon as you meet him you'll understand. 
He sees what we're after. 
He cares about America - old family, basically paid for the Revolutionary War - he gets it. 
He wants to help us win, help restore our pride. 
DAVE My pride is fine. 22. 
MARK No, not.... 
This country's pride. 
Dave just looks at him, silent. 
MARK (CONT'D) Dave - this is it. 
This is what we've wanted our whole lives - just to train - you and me - not to have to deal with USA Wrestling, or Harper and his corrupt university program - not to have to think about anybody else... 
Nancy has wandered over, Danielle on her hip. 
NANCY - What're you guys talking about? 
MARK I'm speaking to my brother, that okay with you? 
Nancy and Dave share a glance. 
Then Nancy turns to walk away. 
NANCY Always good to see you, Mark. (as she walks away) Please, eat our food, shit on our lawn. 
Enjoy yourself... 
The brothers are silent for a long moment until she's gone. 
MARK Why does she... 
He trails off. 
Then, a bit desperate - MARK (CONT'D) The deer hunting on his farm's supposed to be amazing... 
Dave speaks gently. 
DAVE I got a good thing going here. 
I got a contract. 
Nancy's happy, Alex likes his school... 
The reality starts to hit Mark that he may be doing this alone, without his older brother. 
He's shell-shocked. 
MARK The Worlds are sixty days away. 23. 
DAVE Tell me your plan. 
Who you gonna train with? 
MARK (LOST) Du Pont's taking his money out of the Villanova program. 
They'll pull the plug on that. 
So. Dan Bane could come. 
I - I guess Dan Bane. (beat, then, very quietly) I don't know how to do this without you. 
DAVE Do what? 
The answer is "everything" -- but Mark just shakes his head. 
DAVE (CONT'D) It sounds like an opportunity. 
MARK Does it? 
DAVE I think you could make something of it. 
MARK Do you? (DAVE NODS) A spot's always open for you if you decide to come. 
DAVE Thank you. 
Dave steps forward and holds out his arms - DAVE (CONT'D) Congrats, little brother. 
Mark steps into his brother's arms, folding into him, head on his chest, holding on for dear life. 
Nancy looks over. 
CUT TO: 24. 
I/E. 
MARK'S APARTMENT - MORNING Mark packs his apartment - trashing just about everything, tossing it in the dumpster - stuffing the few essentials in his AMC GREMLIN. CUT TO: EXT. DRIVING - DAY Mark drives across Ohio. 
CUT TO: EXT. FILLING STATION - DAY Mark gets gas. 
The attendant - clearly a HIGH SCHOOL WRESTLER - shakes his hand. 
CUT TO: EXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE - DAY Mark pulls onto the estate grounds. 
CUT TO: EXT. FRONT DOOR/BIG HOUSE - DAY Mark rings the doorbell. 
No answer. 
He goes to ring it again and the door is opened by a UNIFORMED MAID. MARK Hi. I'm Mark Schultz. 
Silence. 
That means nothing to her. 
MARK (CONT'D) I'm here to see John du Pont? 
UNIFORMED MAID Is Mr. du Pont expecting you? 
MARK Yeah. 
Well - not today exactly, but, yes. 
This week. 
Sometime. 
UNIFORMED MAID Just a moment, please. 25. 
MARK In the meantime can I use the - She SHUTS the door, leaving him outside. 
He turns and looks out over the VAST LAWN of the estate. 
Far off, it's being mowed by a gardener. 
UNIFORMED MAID (opening the door) Please. 
CUT TO: INT. BIG HOUSE/FOXCATCHER - CONTINUOUS They walk just a few feet and she gestures toward a door. 
MARK (CONFUSED) Is he? 
He's in there? 
UNIFORMED MAID The washroom. 
CUT TO: INT. ROCOCO WASHROOM/BIG HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER Floral wallpaper, gold fixtures and faucet. 
Mark pisses - mouth open, eyes half shut. 
He flushes. 
He looks at a dish holding little pastel horseshoes. 
Soap? 
He picks one up, smells it. 
Washes his hands - monstrous with the tiny soap. 
He wipes his hands on his pants, avoiding the neatly hung towelettes. 
He opens the door. 
UNIFORMED MAID Mr. Beck will see you now. 
Mark doesn't know who Mr. Beck is. 
CUT TO: INT. STAN BECK'S OFFICE/BIG HOUSE - MINUTES LATER Mark is let into a large third floor office with a big desk, wood filing cabinets, LAW BOOKS lining the bookshelves. 
STAN BECK (mid-forties, no-nonsense, suit and tie) rises from behind the desk as Mark enters. 26. 
STAN BECK Come in, sit down. 
MARK Thanks. 
STAN BECK Thank you, Rosie. 
UNIFORMED MAID You're welcome, Mr. Beck. 
She exits, closing the door behind her. 
STAN BECK Okay. 
Okay. 
So. Mark Schultz, correct? 
MARK Yes. 
STAN BECK (opens a folder, writing) S-C-H-U-L-T-Z? 
MARK That's right. 
STAN BECK ... 
M-A-R-K? 
Mark just looks at him. 
Beat. 
Then he nods. 
STAN BECK (CONT'D) All right. 
Mark. 
I manage affairs for Mr. du Pont. 
Look after his interests. 
If you have a problem, you come to me. 
If Mr. Du Pont has a problem, I'll come to you. 
Okay? 
MARK Sounds okay. 
STAN BECK Let's talk about what you're doing here. 
I'd like to make sure we all understand each other. 
Does that sound like a good policy to you? 
MARK That could be a good policy. 27. 
STAN BECK Good. 
I think so, too. 
First thing I can tell you is that Mr. du Pont is very happy he can help you with your goals. 
But I want to make sure you're aware of what's expected. 
It's not a free ride. 
In exchange for the guest house, the more than substantial salary, the privilege of training at Foxcatcher Farms, Mr. du Pont expects results. 
Understood? 
MARK Yes. 
STAN BECK I'm sure you can appreciate that. 
MARK Of course. 
STAN BECK That goes for every wrestler. 
MARK I've actually got suggestions for about half the roster. 
He pulls a creased, folded piece of paper from his pocket. 
STAN BECK What about the other half? 
MARK (BEAT) I've been making phone calls. 
STAN BECK I'll take a look at that when you've finished. 
All right. 
Now. 
Stan takes out a form, writes on it as Mark puts away list. 
STAN BECK (CONT'D) Your age? 
MARK Twenty-seven. 
STAN BECK Education? 28. 
MARK Oklahoma University. 
STAN BECK Undergraduate? 
MARK Yes. 
STAN BECK You graduated? 
MARK Yes. 
STAN BECK Do you own any property? 
MARK No. STAN BECK Are your parents still married? 
MARK (BEAT) No. STAN BECK How old were you when they separated? 
MARK Two. 
STAN BECK Have you ever been accused of a crime? 
MARK No. The DOOR OPENS and John du Pont pokes his head in. 
Mark STANDS, relieved to see him finally -- MARK (CONT'D) Mr. du Pont. 
Du Pont seems surprised to see Mark. 
He stays in the doorway, waves slightly. 
DU PONT Ah. Hello. 
You've arrived. 29. 
MARK Yes sir, I drove straight down. 
It's a little odd that du Pont doesn't enter - he seems nervous. 
He looks at Stan. 
Stan hands him a sheet of paper. 
STAN Tonight's speech. 
All set. 
John takes the paper and glances at it. 
Then - DU PONT They're setting him up in the chalet? 
STAN BECK Yes, sir. 
DU PONT Excellent bed. 
Firm mattress. (SILENCE) Good for the lower back. 
MARK Great. 
DU PONT All right. 
MARK All right. 
Thank you, sir. 
And du Pont's gone, closing the door behind him. 
Beat. 
STAN BECK Shall we finish this? 
Mark sits. 
STAN BECK (CONT'D) Have you ever been sued? 
MARK No. STAN BECK Have you ever initiated a lawsuit? 
CUT TO: 30. 
EXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE - AFTERNOON Brandon walks with Mark. 
They've come far, across the huge side yard - the Big House looks small behind them. 
Mark can see HORSE STABLES that let out onto a huge fenced track with a grass infield. 
Stable hands are putting several thoroughbred horses through their paces. 
BRANDON (re the horses) They're Mrs. du Pont's. 
We all just keep our distance. 
They enter the WOODS. Just inside the trees is THE CHALET - a European style wooden guest house that is now Mark's home. 
MARK I didn't realize he was married. 
BRANDON Mr. du Pont? 
He's not. 
Mrs. du Pont's his mother. 
CUT TO: INT. THE CHALET - AFTERNOON Brandon lets Mark in the door, turns on the lights in the living room, in the kitchen, goes to the bedroom. 
It's decorated like a ski chalet. 
Brandon walks back from the bedroom, holding KEYS out to Mark- BRANDON Utilities are paid for - gas, electric. 
Refrigerator's stocked for now, but in the future you're responsible for feeding yourself. 
Unless of course you get invited to the Big House for dinner. 
Mark, still standing in the entry-way, accepts the keys. 
BRANDON (CONT'D) Someone will bring your car around. 
Anything else you need? 
MARK Has he always lived with his mother? 
BRANDON Mr. du Pont? 
I think so. 31. 
Brandon leaves. 
Mark stands still for a long time, gazing at his new home - including some of the oddities, like the POLAR BEAR SKIN RUG (with HEAD ON) which is draped over the sofa. 
CUT TO: INT. THE CHALET - LATE THAT NIGHT Mark (in tank-top undershirt) tapes up PHOTOS of himself and Dave. 
The POLAR BEAR HEAD on the rug gazes blankly at him. 
A KNOCK on the living room window. 
It's John du Pont, who points toward the front door. 
EXT. PORCH/THE CHALET - CONTINUOUS/LATE NIGHT Mark opens the door. 
John's standing on the little porch, wearing a tux, holding a BOOK and a SMALL BOX. MARK Mr. du Pont, I want to thank you FOR - Du Pont holds up a finger. 
Mark STOPS. Du Pont whispers - DU PONT You hear that? 
Mark listens, shakes his head. 
Du Pont holds up his finger again - and then we HEAR it: a faint HOOTING from the woods. 
DU PONT (CONT'D) Barred owl - He hands Mark the small box he's holding. 
Inside is a very small set of BINOCULARS. DU PONT (CONT'D) When you spot one, you'll see with each hoot there's a white flash in his collar. 
His throat swells, and he reveals to you the lighter feathers he keeps hidden underneath. 
He hands Mark the BOOK: "South Pacific Birds" by John Eleuthere du Pont. 
DU PONT (CONT'D) It's from ten years ago, but I thought you might find it interesting. 32. 
MARK You wrote this? 
DU PONT I did. 
Mark seems genuinely touched and impressed. 
MARK Thank you. 
Do you want to come in? 
DU PONT No no - MARK - The fridge is full - you probably know better than me what's in there- DU PONT - No. You need your rest. 
You need to get started bright and early. 
Du Pont hold up his own set of binoculars. 
DU PONT (CONT'D) - I had a wonderful night a few years back when I spotted all eight Northeast species. 
Right here on the farm. (THEN) What do we have - two months to the Worlds? 
MARK Not even. 54 days. 
DU PONT 54 days. (BEAT) We'll get it done. 
On the two men standing in the porch light. 
PRELAP the sound of POUNDING FEET, getting louder and louder - CUT TO: INT. FOXCATCHER GYM - SEVERAL WEEKS LATER/DAY CLOSE ON: Wrestling shoes running FAST in place on the gym mat. 
There are SIX SETS of feet in a wide circle. 
Team Foxcatcher is beginning to come together. 33. 
MARK Drop! All six wrestlers, Mark included, drop to the mats for 10 fast push-ups and sit-ups. 
The wrestlers are: ROBERTO GARCIA, aka "GECKO" (21 years old, 105 pounds, Latino, as fast a talker as he is a wrestler); JIM ZEREGA - "JIMMY Z" (24, 114 lbs., blond Midwesterner); MATT POPPER (24, 149 lbs., East coast working class); BRUCE SPRINGER (27, also 149 lbs., half Asian); MARK SCHULTZ (180 lbs.); and DAN BANE (30, 198 lbs., strong and low-key, intelligent, from the West, like Mark.) The wrestlers jump up - run in place incredibly fast. 
MARK (CONT'D) DROP - JUMP CUT TO: Garcia and Zerega sprint to the end of the mats and back. 
Relay shuttles, each pair races, then the next pair. 
Popper and Springer have just run (probably for the twentieth time) - they're BENT OVER, sucking wind by the wall. 
Du Pont WALKS IN. He wears a sweatsuit, has a whistle around his neck. 
He hovers a slight distance away, observing, seeming to want to be noticed. 
Mark and Dan take off, racing, as Garcia beats Zerega - Du Pont stares at Garcia. 
As Dan and Mark race back, Dan notices du Pont - DAN Hey, Coach. 
Du Pont becomes at once an odd combination of a kid invited to join in and the actual boss and benefactor of this team. 
DU PONT Dan Bane. 
How's that hamstring? 
DAN Coming back. 
It's coming back. 
DU PONT Good. 
Good to hear. 
Hamstring coming back. 34. 
MARK (walking up to him) Sir, you need me for something? 
DU PONT No no. 
Later. 
Please. 
Continue. 
MARK (nods, turns back) Pair up. 
On the mat. 
Up and down. 
Popper, Springer, let's go. 
Springer's dragging a bit, clearly wiped out. 
GARCIA Spling Loll - must lay off the pohk flied lice. 
SPRINGER (EXHAUSTED) Suck me, Gecko. (as he comes onto the mat) And I'm fucking Filipino, dickhead. 
The six wrestlers are paired and spread out on the mats - each pair in the up-down position. 
MARK Go! They all go to it - the top wrestler trying to get a hold secure enough to turn the other - and the down wrestler splayed on the mat, fending him off. 
Du Pont hovers nearby, watching intently. 
We can sense his fascination - his admiration for these athletes. 
Also, his jealousy - how desperately he'd love to be part of this brotherhood.... 
He CLAPS, like a coach would.... 
DU PONT (awkward, not loud enough) Good. (CLAPS AGAIN) Good. 
CUT TO: EXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE - LATE AFTERNOON Mark, freshly showered, walks across the yard from the field house gym to the Big House. 
CUT TO: 35. 
INT. DU PONT'S OFFICE/BIG HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON Du Pont's pouring himself a scotch and soda at the built-in wall bar. 
Mark's in the SITTING AREA of this large office, which gives the unmistakable impression of having been inspired by the Oval Office. (We should sense that this is not the first of these meetings.) DU PONT I can't get you anything at all? 
MARK No, thank you. 
I'm good. 
DU PONT In training. 
Excellent. 
He comes over and sits. 
He's immediately hushed and serious. 
DU PONT (CONT'D) Talk to me about Roberto Garcia. 
MARK Gecko? 
Great wrestler. 
What do you want to know? 
Du Pont sits there nodding. 
He's mulling something. 
DU PONT Just a sense. 
Keep your eye on him. 
Let me know of anything suspicious. 
Subversive. 
Anti. 
MARK Anti-what? 
DU PONT Anything at all. 
Phone calls. 
Anything. 
MARK (no idea what that means) I will. 
Du Pont stands and goes over to a carved WOODEN EAGLE on top of one of the desk. 
DU PONT You see the artistry, the care, the craftsmanship that went into making this great American symbol? 
You see the face hidden among the feathers? (MARK LOOKS) Right here. 36. 
Mark looks. 
He doesn't see it. 
But he NODS anyway. 
DU PONT (CONT'D) We need to exert the same care in crafting a world-class wrestling experience here at Foxcatcher. (MARK NODS) How're we doing with Dave Schultz? 
MARK How do you mean? 
DU PONT You were going to speak to him again. 
When's he coming? 
MARK Right. 
Look. 
Dave's... he's got a good situation going up in Madison. 
He's... he doesn't want to uproot. 
The family. 
Just at the moment. (BEAT) At the present time. 
DU PONT He is a world class competitor - a world class coach. 
We are building a world class team. 
He belongs here. 
Tell me what I have to offer him. 
MARK Mr. du Pont, I don't... you can't buy Dave. 
Silence. 
Du Pont's clearly not happy with this answer. 
MARK (CONT'D) I wasn't... 
I didn't realize you wanted him to coach. 
DU PONT Wrestle and coach. 
We all coach each other. 
Support each other. 
His tone suddenly turns bright and positive - DU PONT (CONT'D) Let me ask your opinion - He goes to the desk, where there are several large DRAWINGS of a proposed Foxcatcher logo: a RED FOX running. 
In some, the fox runs one way, in some the other. 
Mark approaches. 37. 
DU PONT (CONT'D) What do you think? 
Right to left, or left to right? 
Silence as Mark examines the designs intently. 
Then, finally - MARK Right to left. 
Du Pont looks at him, then back at the drawings. 
On the two of them - studying, contemplating... 
CUT TO: EXT. WOODS/FOXCATCHER - EARLY MORNING Mark RUNS hard through the woods - pushing himself - jumping fallen branches, sprinting up hills. 
He reaches the edge of the woods and stops, bent over, breathing heavily. 
Across the field, PRIZE HORSES are led out of the stables onto the grounds of the estate. 
Mark WATCHES. A few wrestlers (Zerega, Popper and Dan Bane) emerge from the woods behind Mark, running. 
Dan Bane leaves the other two. 
DAN I'll catch up with you all later. 
Zerega and Popper jog off. 
Dan comes to stand next to Mark, who has taken his little pair of BINOCULARS from the pocket of his sweats and is looking through them. 
After a moment, he hands Dan the binoculars. 
Dan looks through them. 
MARK I'm pretty sure that's John's mother. 
BINOCULARS POV: A VERY OLD WOMAN stands in front of her wheelchair, with the help of an attendant. 
When the horses reach her, she TOUCHES THEM LOVINGLY, tenderly stroking their faces, feeding them treats from her hands. 
She's completely at home with these animals, as they are with her. 
CUT TO: INT. WRESTLING ARENA/CLERMONT-FERRAND, FRANCE - DAY Dave Schultz SLAMS his opponent to the mat. 
He's in TEAM USA uniform, and he's dominating. 38. 
Du Pont watches from the stands, transfixed. 
Then he glances over at: Mark. 
Off to the side, watching his brother wrestle. 
Whether he's fascinated, jealous, rooting - we can't tell. 
CUT TO: INT. WRESTLING ARENA/CLERMONT-FERRAND - LATER/DAY Mark wrestles like an animal - aggressive, forceful and fast. 
Dave's in Mark's corner, coaching - focused, intense, and very tough on Mark - shouting instruction. 
On du Pont, watching from the stands... 
CUT TO: INT. DAVE'S HOTEL ROOM - EVENING Loud. 
The TV is on. 
A few Team USA WRESTLERS watch the French Sports TV wrap-up of the day's matches. 
Danielle JUMPS on the bed near the window, with Nancy watching her. 
DANIELLE One... twois... quatro! Nancy laughs. 
Dave wrestles with Alexander on the other bed. 
CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE DAVE'S ROOM - SAME TIME Du Pont and Mark are outside the door. 
Mark holds a VIDEOTAPE. He KNOCKS. No answer. 
CUT TO: INT. DAVE'S HOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME Dave wrestling with Alex on the bed. 
DAVE ...Fireman's carry... to a half- nelson... to a chicken wing... 
Wait! A chicken wing? 
He starts to gobble up Alex's arm, who SHRIEKS in delight. 
CUT TO: 39. 
INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE DAVE'S ROOM - SAME TIME Mark knocks again. 
We HEAR Nancy's voice yell from inside: "It's open!" Mark opens the door. 
INT. DAVE'S HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS Noisy, chaotic. 
The wrestlers glance over "Hey, Mark" "What's up".... 
Mark's focused on Dave, who wrestles with Alex - MARK Dave. 
DAVE - a scrambled-egg!... a feather- pluck!... 
Dave's plucking Alex and Alex is cracking up. 
MARK Dave. 
DAVE Hey, Mark -- MARK Come meet Mr. du Pont. 
Dave sweeps up Alex and throws him over his shoulder, carrying him to the door. 
He SHAKES du Pont's HAND. DAVE Hi. Dave Schultz. 
DU PONT John du Pont. 
It's a pleasure to meet you in person finally. 
MARK (TO DAVE) I told him how excited you were to meet him. 
DAVE This is Alex, that's my wife, Nancy, our daughter Danielle. (TO NANCY) Hey, Nance. 
John du Pont. 
Nancy waves from over near the window - NANCY Hey. 40. 
DU PONT Hello. 
DAVE Come on in. 
Can I get you a drink - DU PONT No no. 
DAVE You sure - ? 
DU PONT Thank you. 
No. I need to be getting back. 
But, don't worry - we'll make a Foxcatcher out of you yet. (he laughs awkwardly) Until tomorrow. 
And he's GONE. Beat. 
Dave shrugs. 
DAVE Well, I know what I need. 
MARK What? 
DAVE Turkey drumstick! He throws Alex on the bed and jumps on him. 
Alex SQUEALS. Mark heads for the TV across the room. 
Pops in his video. 
MARK Dave, check out the tape I have on NANEV - DAVE (STILL WRESTLING) YEAH - MARK I want to show you this downblock - DAVE Cue it up. 
As the tape cues up, Mark glances at Nancy. 
MARK Too difficult to come say hello to Mr. du Pont? 41. 
NANCY I said hello. (lights a CIGARETTE) I'm watching my kid. 
MARK It's John du Pont. 
One of the most generous men in America. 
He's gonna save USA Wrestling. (re. cigarette) Can you not do that in here? 
NANCY Do what? 
MARK Smoking. 
NANCY Smoke? 
MARK I wrestle tomorrow. 
NANCY It's my room, Mark. 
You don't have to be here. 
MARK I'm trying to get advice from my brother, get ready for the finals - NANCY Go get ready - MARK You start smoking - ? 
NANCY You can leave. 
Go to your own room - MARK - Your kids are in here - She BLOWS SMOKE at him. 
MARK (CONT'D) What the hell is that? 
DAVE Mark. 
Calm down. 
MARK I'm not the one frigging smoking. 42. 
DAVE The window's open. 
Relax. 
Show me what you want me to look at. 
Mark looks around the room. 
At Alexander giggling on the bed, at Danielle bouncing, Nancy BLOWING SMOKE RINGS. It's all too much. 
He pulls out the videotape and WALKS OUT the door. 
CUT TO: INT. ARENA/CLERMONT-FERRAND - DAY VARIOUS SHOTS: Final matches in progress, intense and brutal. 
CUT TO: INT. LOCKER ROOM - SAME TIME Mark sits, alone, head in his hands. 
CUT TO: INT. ARENA/CLERMONT-FERRAND - SAME TIME Faces in the crowd watching; strained faces of the wrestlers. 
Mark Schultz and Alexander Nanev's names are put up on the board. 
FINALS à 82 KILOS... 
CUT TO: INT. LOCKER ROOM - SAME TIME Du Pont enters. 
Mark's alone on a corner bench, frozen, head in his hands. 
Silence. 
Du Pont is stiff, but gentle. 
DU PONT I think you're up. 
Silence. 
Du Pont goes over to him, unsure what to do. 
Uncomfortable, he puts his hand on Mark's shoulder. 
DU PONT (CONT'D) Mark. 
Dave just won. 
It's your turn. 
Mark's body starts to shake. 
Then, very quietly: MARK I don't want to let you down. 43. 
This is the first time anyone has said anything like this to du Pont. 
He has no idea how to respond. 
He woodenly pats Mark's shoulder, then takes his hand back. 
DU PONT I can't.... 
I've watched you these past months... (long beat, then quietly) I can't imagine being let down by you. 
Mark stops shaking. 
Du Pont stands patiently beside him. 
CUT TO: INT. ARENA/CLERMONT-FERRAND - MOMENTS LATER CAMERA'S TIGHT ON Mark as he enters the arena. 
Mark walks directly onto the mat, straight to the center, faces off with the Bulgarian, NANEV. CAMERA stays tight on Mark looking directly at Nanev, as the ref checks each of them. 
WHISTLE. The match begins. 
Intense and rough. 
Neither able to gain an edge. 
Dave coaches from Mark's corner. 
CUT TO: In between periods. 
Mark sits as Dave FANS him with a towel, shouting instruction. 
Mark glances behind him: du Pont watches from the stands. 
CUT TO: Mark and Nanev wrestle the final seconds - Mark ahead by a point. 
Nanev tries desperately to turn Mark, to gain any advantage. 
The whistle blows. 
The ref takes each of their hands. 
He RAISES Mark's. 
He turns them around, raises Mark's hand again. 
Mark does a BACK FLIP. He trots over to the opposing coach, shakes his hand. 
He trots to his corner where Dave - beaming, his arms open wide - embraces him. 
Mark hugs his brother quickly, then turns to LOOK OUT into the stands. 
He SPOTS du Pont, who's coming down the steps toward the platform. 
Mark walks toward him. 
The enormity of what he's just accomplished STARTS TO HIT Mark. 
His face is red. 
He reaches du Pont, and from a step below him, THROWS HIS ARMS around him, clings to him. 
Mark starts to SOB. Du Pont holds him as he looks out toward the wrestling mat, where Dave watches. 44. 
PRELAP SOUND: The beginning "AAAAAH's" of David Bowie's "LET'S DANCE". CUT TO: INT. TROPHY ROOM/BIG HOUSE - NIGHT "LET'S DANCE" blasts from the stereo. 
Team Foxcatcher wrestlers are huddled in a circle in the Trophy Room - shouting the "AAAAAAAH's" along with the thin white duke. 
Each holds a BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE, shaking it up as they sing. 
When the chords kick in, they POP THEIR CORKS - SPRAYING champagne on each other, shouting wildly. 
Then they all CHUG the rest of their bottles. 
Du Pont is dancing around outside the circle, doing his best Euro-electronica moves, and drinking from his bottle (and it's not his first). 
The wrestlers DANCE. When du Pont finishes his bottle - DU PONT Let's clear it out! He gestures toward the center section of the enormous TROPHY CASE - the entirety of which is filled with horse-jumping and fox-hunting medals, ribbons and plaques. 
Some of the wrestlers open the glass doors and start taking down what's in there. 
A few of the others open more liquor... 
DU PONT (CONT'D) Oh, yes! SPRINGER You sure about this? 
DU PONT Mother's idea of sport is riding a horse that's chasing a dog that's chasing a fox. 
I don't share her affection for horseflesh - The center case is cleared out. 
DU PONT (CONT'D) Put `em up, boys! They hang their wrestling medals, place in trophies and other awards - leaving the TOP FEW HOOKS EMPTY. WRESTLERS (CHANTING TOGETHER) Mark! Mark! Mark! Mark!... 45. 
Mark hangs his OLYMPIC and WORLD CUP GOLDS on the top hooks. 
WRESTLERS (CONT'D) U.S.A! U.S.A! U.S.A!... 
Du Pont raises his bottle to Mark - DU PONT You've brought honor to Team Foxcatcher. 
He starts to walk toward him. 
DU PONT (CONT'D) You've brought honor to - He SLIPS on the wet floor and his feet fly up in front of him, landing him FLAT ON HIS BACK. SILENCE. Du Pont's lying there, shaking - is he crying? 
No one knows what exactly to do. 
Dan Bane approaches him. 
DAN You all right, Coach? 
Du Pont starts LAUGHING out loud. 
Hugely relieved, Dan holds his hand out to him to help him up. 
Du Pont takes Dan's hand and promptly pulls him to the ground... and... 
JUMPS on his back - WRESTLING with him. 
The wrestlers, including Mark, go crazy, CHEERING him on. 
Dan lets du Pont get the best of him... lets du Pont PIN him. 
The wrestlers are cheering madly as du Pont stands with his arms raised. 
He makes as if he's about to do a back flip (like Mark), then sits and does a clumsy backwards somersault. 
Wild cheers. 
DU PONT More drinks! He's on his knees, fists in the air, head thrown back - TOTALLY EXULTANT... 
PRELAP sound of a GUNSHOT - CUT TO: EXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE - NEXT MORNING VARIOUS SHOTS: The AMERICAN FLAG being raised; a hawk soars above the trees; Jean du Pont BRUSHES the horses in the barn. 46. 
CAMERA picks up wrestlers running off their hangovers - Zerega, Popper, Springer, Mark. 
They pick up speed as the camera stays with them. 
WE HEAR more gunshots as they run through the grounds - the SHOTS get louder and louder. 
The wrestlers run somewhat near the FIRING RANGE, where several members of the NEWTOWN POLICE DEPARTMENT, in uniform, are SHOOTING target practice with DU PONT. Du Pont wears a "Team Foxcatcher" zip SWEATJACKET - with his honorary POLICE BADGE pinned to one breast. 
On the other breast are sewn the words: "Head Coach", and JOHN "EAGLE" DU PONT. He's about to SHOOT when the wrestlers pass by - WRESTLERS (EXCEPT MARK) Johnny D! Bossman!... 
Du Pont, still holding his pistol, turns to watch them run past. 
His expression seems oddly, entirely blank. 
CUT TO: INT. FOXCATCHER GYM/WEIGHT ROOM - DAY A few wrestlers lift weights - the others are hanging out, resting, talking. 
Du Pont wanders in, his target practice PISTOL dangling from the crook of his arm. 
A few guys notice him, greet him CASUALLY, go back to what they were doing. 
Du Pont FIRES a bullet through the roof. 
SILENCE. DU PONT 321 days to Seoul, gentlemen. 321 days. 
Let's get to work. 
He gestures for Mark to join him. 
DU PONT (CONT'D) Come talk to me. 
CUT TO: INT. DU PONT'S OFFICE - DAY CLOSE ON: a CHECK for $10,000.00 made out to Mark Schultz. 
MARK (O.S.) You don't have to do this. 
John sits at his desk, pistol stuck in his waistband. 
Mark, sweaty, stands across the desk from him, holding the check. 47. 
DU PONT America doesn't respect you. 
Doesn't place any value on you at all. 
I reward accomplishment. 
MARK Thank you, Coach. 
DU PONT Please. 
Call me John. 
Or Coach. 
Whichever you prefer. 
Maybe Eagle. 
Or Coach. 
Eagle is good. (THEN) How're we doing with Dave? 
Mark carefully folds the check, avoiding du Pont's gaze. 
DU PONT (CONT'D) You spoke to him again at the Worlds. 
MARK Yes. 
Yes, I did. 
I... (BEAT) It's not gonna happen. 
He got offered a contract extension at Wisconsin, Team USA wants him to train Olympic wrestlers next summer, he - it's not gonna happen. 
John is clearly unhappy with this answer. 
He removes the gun from his waistband, places it on the desk. 
DU PONT Do you believe in this team? 
MARK Of course I - DU PONT - Do you believe we deserve this country's best talent? 
MARK I do - DU PONT - I pay for results not only on the mat, but in recruiting the best of the best to Foxcatcher Farms. 
That's part of your job. 
Silence. 
Mark looks shamed by this. 48. 
DU PONT (CONT'D) It's probably best. 
Dave intimidates you. 
You don't believe you can ever do better than your brother. 
Glass ceiling. 
Impossible for you to break through. 
It looks like perhaps Mark believes this as well. 
MARK (TENTATIVE) Do you think that's true? 
Because... all these years - Du Pont stands suddenly - DU PONT - Well. 
You're the public face of Foxcatcher. 
MARK If that's what - DU PONT - What do you know about Masters League wrestling tournaments? 
MARK Uh - well - not all that much - DU PONT - Because I'm thinking of entering one. 
Beat. 
Mark nods - MARK Okay... 
CUT TO: CLOSE ON: VIDEOTAPE image of Mark at the 1984 Olympics, his hand being raised by the ref... 
Mark raises both hands in the air, glances slightly down, then out at the crowd... 
The image FREEZES, is rewound, plays again. 
At the moment Mark raises his arms and GLANCES DOWN, the image FREEZES. PHOTOGRAPHER (O.C.) This is the one. 
CUT TO: 49. 
INT. DINING ROOM/BIG HOUSE - CONTINUOUS/DAY The furniture has been pushed to the walls in the huge formal dining room, and a large WHITE SCRIM has been erected at one end. 
A FASHION PHOTOGRAPHER who could double as a member of Devo, stands at a video monitor with du Pont. 
PHOTOGRAPHER He wears the singlet - DU PONT - and the gold medal - PHOTOGRAPHER - and, of course, the gold medal. 
And a lot of oil. 
Mark's in a dressing area wearing his FOXCATCHER SINGLET and Olympic gold. 
Two assistants stuff his crotch with a bit of padding. 
PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D) A lot of oil. 
Please. 
More oil. 
It defines the musculature. 
Mark walks to his spot in front of the scrim. 
The two assistants slather baby oil on his arms and chest and legs as the photographer SHOWS him the pose on the monitor. 
PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D) You're winning the gold medal. 
You're raising your arms in triumph. 
You're also feeling humility. 
Du Pont is hanging back, but staring intensely at Mark. 
Mark looks over to him. 
MARK You good with this? 
DU PONT It's wonderful. 
It's exactly what I needed from you. 
The photographer takes his place behind the camera as the assistants finish with the baby oil and clear away. 
PHOTOGRAPHER Good! Now. 
Mark. 
You're winning the gold medal! And you are humbled! Mark raises his arms and glances down. 
FLASH. FLASH. 50. 
PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D) Good! And again! JUMP TO: Du Pont, in his Foxcatcher sweatsuit, is now in front of the scrim with Mark (still in his singlet.) Mark starts to hug du Pont for a photo - DU PONT I think you were below me by a couple of steps when you hugged me at the Worlds. 
PHOTOGRAPHER It's true. 
DU PONT Maybe if you kneeled. 
MARK Kneeled now? 
On the floor. (UNSURE) Really? 
It won't look... 
DU PONT No. No. You should kneel. 
Mark kneels in front of du Pont. 
Hugs him. 
FLASH. FLASH. DU PONT (CONT'D) I think you were crying. 
CUT TO: EXT. FOXCATCHER LAWN - TWILIGHT Mark and John, wearing TUXEDOS, board a large helicopter. 
It's cold out. 
CUT TO: INT. HELICOPTER (AIRBORNE) - EVENING Mark and John are flown southwest toward Washington DC by Larry the pilot. 
John takes a folded piece of paper from his jacket pocket, hands it to Mark. 
DU PONT Brandon and I prepared some remarks. 51. 
Mark takes the paper and reads it over. 
He looks worried. 
DU PONT (CONT'D) Don't be nervous. 
You'll do great. 
Mark's not so sure. 
Then he HEARS a SNIFF. He looks over at du Pont: he's got a COCAINE BULLET in one nostril. 
Du Pont inhales, then OFFERS the bullet to Mark. 
Mark's frozen - DU PONT (CONT'D) What? 
You've never done this? (Mark shakes his head) It helps put everything in perspective. 
Trust me.... 
Mark. 
It's just cocaine. 
Trust me. 
Mark takes the coke bullet, examines it for several moments, then holds it to one nostril. 
He INHALES. DU PONT (CONT'D) Nice. 
You brought the medals? (MARK NODS) Good. 
Try the speech. 
MARK Read it? 
DU PONT Read the speech. 
MARK (READING) John Eagle du Pont, highly respected ornithologist, author, world explorer, phil... phila... 
DU PONT Philatelist. 
The helicopter nears the LIT UP city of WASHINGTON D.C. 
CUT TO: INT. HILTON HOTEL, DC/COCKTAIL AREA - NIGHT LARGE SIGN on an EASEL by the entrance reads: "CITIZENS' DEFENSE OF PATRIOTS FUND - 1st ANNUAL GALA AND AUCTION". Loads of tuxedoed Republicans and their wives or mistresses mill about. 
Small talk, hearty laughter, awarding of defense contracts, gallons of martinis. 
CUT TO: 52. 
INT. HILTON HOTEL, DC/COCKTAIL AREA - LATER/NIGHT DU PONT (O.C.) That's the one! That's the one I need! A FINGER is jabbing at a military photograph of an M-113 ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIER (APC). We're in a corner of the reception. 
Du Pont stands with Steve Graham, looking at a set of PHOTOS. Mark's nearby, chewing vigorously on a straw. 
STEVE In that case, the Grand Old Party wants to help find you one. 
Graham calls over to the 3-star GENERAL in full dress uniform who's chewing on a cigar and drinking gin with a Senator. 
STEVE (CONT'D) General, any of these models available? 
GENERAL Which? 
We might have a couple of those left on the lot. (to du Pont) You gonna need financing? 
Everyone laughs. 
Du Pont smiles. 
DU PONT What I need is the gun turret. 
Don't send me one without that MK- 19 mounted on top. 
GENERAL Uh... 
I don't know there, son. 
Civilians don't usually get 40mm blowback grenade launchers. 
STEVE General, John du Pont is hardly your usual civilian. 
The General turns back to the Senator, grumbling - GENERAL Am I supposed to get him a 12-pack of live fucking grenades, too? 
CUT TO: 53. 
INT. HILTON HOTEL, DC/BANQUET HALL - NIGHT Mark's on stage, at the podium, READING from his Brandon- prepared remarks with - shall we say - some vigor... 
MARK ... highly respected ornithologist, author, world explorer, phil... phila... 
Du Pont watches from the wings, whispers: DU PONT Philatelist. 
Mark looks over at him blankly - he has no idea what du Pont just said. 
DU PONT (CONT'D) Philatelist. (Mark just looks at him) PHILAT-- (GIVING UP) Stamp collector. 
MARK Stamp collector, and former pentathlete. 
Jean, in the audience, in her wheelchair, almost imperceptibly shakes her head. 
MARK (CONT'D) Mr. Du Pont will be making his return to competitive sports in the over-50 category at the Masters' League du Pont Wrestling Invitational in Phoenix, Arizona this March. 
Scattered applause, though no one has any idea what he's talking about. 
Du Pont watches from the wings. 
Mark reads. 
MARK (CONT'D) I'm so proud to introduce my mentor. 
He has the ability to look at me and see where I am in life. 
He knows how to motivate me. 
I feel his love for me as an athlete and as a human being. 
My mother and father were divorced when I was two years old. 
I spent a lifetime looking for a father... (MORE) 54. 
MARK (CONT'D) and I found one in the Golden, uh... the Gold Eagle of America - John du Pont. 
Applause as du Pont strides onstage, hugs Mark. 
Du Pont turns, beaming (and a little hopped-up) to the audience - DU PONT Mark Schultz. 
Thank you, son. (waves to Jean in AUDIENCE) Hello, Mother. (to them all) The gold medal Mark won in 1984 was tarnished. 
Tarnished by Jimmy Carter. 
Tarnished by the unpatriotic acts of that democrat administration. 
He caused the entire Eastern bloc to boycott our Los Angeles Games. 
Mark will have an opportunity to shine up that medal at the World Championships in just a few short weeks. 
To prove his worth in front of the assembled nations of the globe... 
CUT TO: EXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE - ESTABLISHING/LATE AFTERNOON Some time has passed. 
Lights are on in the windows of the Field House Gym. 
CUT TO: INT. FOXCATCHER GYM - LATE AFTERNOON Mark kneels on the mat with du Pont, holding him in the starting position. 
Mark is talking du Pont through the moves for an escape. 
We get the sense that this is not the first of these lessons. 
MARK Ready? 
Go. Du Pont clumsily attempts the escape. 
Mark is incredibly gentle with him, even tender, easing him through the moves. 55. 
MARK (CONT'D) Okay. 
Let's try it again. 
CUT TO: INT. THE CHALET - NIGHT Mark's HAIR IS NOW CUT SHORT AND BLEACHED WHITE. He's in shorts - no shirt - on the phone. 
He's sipping a beer, walking around the living room - MARK (ON PHONE) Yeah. 
I'm good. 
Yeah.... 
All good. 
INTERCUT with Dave in the U of W gym office, looking out over a wrestling team night practice. 
DAVE (ON PHONE) You working hard? 
MARK (ON PHONE) Yeah. 
No, I'm kind of giving myself a bit of a break right now. 
I'll ramp it up again as the trials come closer. 
DAVE (ON PHONE) All right. 
How close? 
There a KNOCK on Mark's window. 
Mark looks over and sees du Pont standing outside, an eager look on his face. 
He beckons to Mark and moves TWO FINGERS as if cutting his own hair. 
MARK (to du Pont) Just a sec... 
DAVE (ON PHONE) What's that? 
MARK (ON PHONE) No, I wasn't - listen, I gotta run - DAVE (ON PHONE) What're you doing? 
MARK (ON PHONE) I just - I gotta run. 
DAVE (ON PHONE) (BEAT) Okay. 
Call me soon. 56. 
MARK (ON PHONE) I will - DAVE (ON PHONE) - You're a tough man to track down - MARK (ON PHONE) - Yeah, well - DAVE (ON PHONE) - Call me - MARK (ON PHONE) - I will. 
I gotta roll - CUT TO: EXT. VERANDA/BIG HOUSE - NIGHT Bowie's "China Girl" PLAYS through outdoor speakers. 
Mark crops du Pont's hair with an ELECTRIC CLIPPER. It's unseasonably warm out - Mark's in shorts and flip flops. 
Both men are drinking from bottles of champagne. 
Du Pont's drunk enough that his defenses are down. 
A vanity table is on the veranda with a mirror and a bowl of COCAINE. MARK Looking good. (NO REPLY) Looking tough. 
Mark finishes buzzing -- looks at du Pont's crew cut in the mirror. 
Du Pont seems melancholy. 
MARK (CONT'D) I think you're ready. (BEAT) We just need some more talc. 
They both reach over to the bowl of "talc", rub some on their gums -- then they each snort a line. 
MARK (CONT'D) Yah! I think you're ready. 
DU PONT I appreciate this... 
MARK You've done the training, you learned the moves. 
You're ready to rumble, boss. 57. 
DU PONT No. Mark. 
I appreciate this. 
MARK (after a moment) It's nothing. 
DU PONT When I was fourteen - my father had left us long before that - my best friend was Clifford Holt, our gardener's son. 
Then I found out Mother had been paying Cliff to be friends with me. 
Mark is moved, but doesn't know what to say. 
MARK We all have demons. 
DU PONT (TOTALLY SINCERE) It's good to know you and I have come to this... friendship without any of that nonsense. 
Financial nonsense. 
Neither mentions that du Pont is actually paying Mark. 
Silence. 
Mark struggles whether to admit something. 
Then - MARK When Dave's son, Alex, was born he had some problems with his lungs. 
It looked like he wasn't gonna live. 
I was sitting in the hospital waiting room, and all I could think was: Maybe it's better if he dies. 
Dave won't be distracted. 
We can get back to training together. (BEAT) Alex is fine now and, you know, he's my nephew. 
I'm not proud I wanted him to die, but it's the truth. 
That's just the truth. (THEN) You gotta conquer your demons. 
Du Pont stands up. 
Expressionless, he disappears through the sliding glass doors into the house. 
Mark LOOKS OUT over the dark grounds of Foxcatcher. 
Quiet. 
Then Mark jumps out of his skin as a MACHINE GUN FIRES several rounds behind him. 58. 
When he turns around, there's du Pont, a determined look on his face, pointing a semi-automatic MACHINE GUN out into the rolling landscape. 
DU PONT Conquer demons. 
He FIRES again, a short burst of bullets into the dark. 
Du Pont fires again, a sustained volley into the dark... 
MARK (over the gunfire) Yeahhhhh!!!! Du Pont ceases fire and looks out. 
He begins lowering the gun when it accidentally goes off, firing a few bullets into the wood deck - though he doesn't seem to notice. 
DU PONT They're dead. 
CUT TO: INT. LEAR JET - DAY SILENCE, save for the steady HUM of flight inside the cabin. 
Du Pont's gazing out the window of this private jet; he's trying to be brave, but he's clearly terrified of the upcoming match. 
Mark sits next to du Pont, on the aisle. 
CUT TO: INT. PHOENIX ARENA - DAY Between periods at the "Du Pont Masters Open and Collegiate Invitational". 
Very few people in the Masters gym bleachers. 
Large posters of the oiled-up Mark on the walls. 
Through large OPEN DOORS, in the adjoining gym, a larger crowd cheers on a number of NCAA wrestlers. 
FRED COLE and another USA WRESTLING OFFICIAL look in from the other gym. 
They SEE the posters of Mark on the walls, and they SEE: An exhausted du Pont, in his Foxcatcher singlet, is slumped in his chair, encouraging Mark to massage his shoulders. 
Mark OBLIGES. Mark glances at the OPEN DOORS, notices Fred Cole. 
Self-conscious, he ignores Cole and focuses on John. 59. 
MARK When he gives you the slightest opening, you gotta shoot in on him. 
Be aggressive. 
Show him who's boss. 
Du Pont nods wearily. 
He can barely move. 
CUT TO: The final minute of the match. 
It's clearly RIGGED. The OTHER WRESTLER is trying to let the exhausted du Pont get the best of him. 
Mark watches. 
The REF blows the end of match whistle. 
The wrestlers stand, du Pont struggling to his feet. 
The ref takes each of their hands, and raises... du Pont's. 
He's "won". 
Du Pont limps off the mat. 
He approaches Mark, THROWS his arms around him the way Mark hugged du Pont at the Worlds. 
Mark glances toward the open doors to the other gym. 
CUT TO: INT. LOCKER ROOM/PHOENIX ARENA - MINUTES LATER Mark and an exhausted du Pont enter the locker room. 
Mark SEES, off in a corner, Brandon speaking quietly with the OTHER WRESTLER from du Pont's match. 
He watches Brandon HAND the other wrestler an ENVELOPE. CUT TO: EXT. FOXCATCHER LAWN - EVENING/ESTABLISHING The helicopter is on the lawn, blades slowing, shutting down. 
DU PONT (V.O.) I've rearranged some of the horse ribbons, Mother... 
CUT TO: INT. JEAN DU PONT'S ROOMS/FOXCATCHER - EVENING John is seated in front of his mother, next to a window in her third floor room. 
She's in her wheelchair, with the oxygen tubes in her nose, imperious as ever. 
DU PONT ... 
Some of the older prizes in the trophy case. (MORE) 60. 
DU PONT (CONT'D) To make room for Team Foxcatcher medals.... 
For the wrestling awards. 
Silence. 
Jean just looks at her son, not reacting. 
DU PONT (CONT'D) Including this, Mother. 
Ha. Which I've actually just won. 
He takes his WINNER'S PLAQUE out of a duffel bag, trying to be casual, but seeming all the more like an eager 9 year-old. 
He holds it out for her. 
She doesn't take it, but leans forward slightly to read what's inscribed on it: "FIRST PLACE, OVER-50, DU PONT MASTER'S INVITATIONAL: JOHN `EAGLE' DU PONT." She sits back. 
JEAN Which ribbons? 
DU PONT I'm sorry? 
JEAN Which ribbons did you move? 
DU PONT Just some of the older ones. 
From the case. 
From the Rosemont case. 
Silence. 
JEAN I'll have a look later to see exactly what you've done. 
CUT TO: INT. TROPHY ROOM - DAY C/U's of Jean's ribbons in the case, horse photos, etc. 
CUT TO: EXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE - NEXT MORNING/ESTABLISHING On the vast lawn, the gardener drives his mower. 
CUT TO: 61. 
INT. FOXCATCHER GYM - LATE MORNING Du Pont, in Foxcatcher sweats, walks in. 
The gym is EMPTY. CUT TO: INT. GARCIA AND ZEREGA'S BUNGALOW/FOXCATCHER - LATE MORNING Mark and the team are watching a VIDEOTAPE Garcia has gotten of an early ULTIMATE FIGHTING MATCH. It's an American street fighter versus a huge Brazilian Jujutsu expert. 
The match is brutal and bloody and the wrestlers watching are CLEARLY INTO IT. Mark is lying on the couch - attentive, but quiet. 
There's KNOCKING at the door, but the guys don't notice it. 
Much LOUDER KNOCKING. Garcia opens the door. 
It's du Pont. 
Mark RISES to greet him as Dan MUTES the video. 
MARK (COMPLETELY GENUINE) Hi, Boss. 
How you doing? 
Any soreness from the match? 
DU PONT I went by the gym - it's almost noon - and there's no one in there. 
There is no one in there. 
In the gym. 
MARK Yeah, no, exactly - we've got an intense workout scheduled this afternoon. 
Real intense one. 
So we're taking the morning to rest up. 
DU PONT Who precisely is in charge around here? 
MARK Well, I mean, I am. 
DU PONT Where do we stand on Dave? 
MARK (BEAT) On what? 
DU PONT David Schultz. 
Your brother. 
When is he coming to Foxcatcher? 62. 
Beat. 
Mark glances at the other guys. 
DU PONT (CONT'D) We need someone to take charge around here, someone to lead. 
MARK John, seriously, I don't know how else to say it. 
It's not gonna happen. 
You can't buy Dave. 
It's just not gonna happen. 
Du Pont SLAPS Mark. 
HARD. Across the face. 
SILENCE. Mark could destroy du Pont. 
He doesn't seem to even consider it. 
He just stands there, like a chastened schoolboy, his face reddening. 
Du Pont WALKS OUT past the muted UFC on TV - Once he's gone, no one speaks. 
Then: GARCIA You got bitch-slapped. 
Mark turns to Garcia. 
GARCIA (CONT'D) Oh shit. 
Garcia runs into the other room. 
CUT TO: INT. BATHROOM/THE CHALET - DAY Mark stands at the sink STARING at his reflection as the mirror fogs over from the RUNNING SHOWER: bleached hair, one side of his face is red where du Pont slapped him. 
CUT TO: INT. BEDROOM/THE CHALET - DAY Mark sits on the edge of his bed. 
He's neatly dressed, his wet hair brushed. 
His face shaved. 
He doesn't move. 
CUT TO: 63. 
EXT. FOXCATCHER LAWN - DAY Mark walks quickly across the vast lawn toward the Big House. 
CUT TO: INT. OFFICE ENTRANCE/BIG HOUSE - DAY Mark enters the Big House through the rear office entrance. 
No one's in the reception area. 
MARK Hello?... 
Hello? 
He starts up the stairs, two at a time. 
Stan Beck comes out of his office, meets him at the top. 
STAN BECK Mark. 
How are things? 
MARK I need to see John. 
STAN BECK Mr. du Pont's not available right now. 
MARK Stan, please. 
I need to see him. 
STAN BECK He's got a very full schedule this afternoon. 
But I'll let him know you stopped by. 
MARK (more and more upset) Listen - I - something happened. 
There was a - misunderstanding. 
I think I did something wrong and I really need to talk to him about it- STAN BECK - Mark, I hear you. 
But Mr. du Pont's away for the afternoon on business. 
He's simply not here. 
Mark doesn't move. 
STAN BECK (CONT'D) You're going to have to do this later. 64. 
Mark's frozen, not knowing what to do, where to go... 
PRELAP: KNOCKING on a DOOR... 
CUT TO: INT. BEDROOM/THE CHALET - THAT NIGHT/LATE Mark awakens with a start to the sound of someone KNOCKING at the front door. 
He looks at the clock. 
It's 3 a.m. 
CUT TO: I/E. 
FRONT DOOR/THE CHALET - NIGHT Mark opens the door to find du Pont standing there, in his SWEATS. He clearly hasn't been to bed. 
And it's clearly an artificial stimulant that's been keeping him awake. 
DU PONT New moves. 
Wrestling moves. 
Need to try them out. 
MARK Oh, uh - DU PONT In the gym. 
Beat. 
Mark forces the cobwebs from his head. 
MARK Yeah, of course. 
Just... just give me a minute. 
CUT TO: INT. FOXCATCHER GYM - NIGHT Mark and du Pont are down on the wrestling mat. 
Du Pont on top. 
He's both weirdly aggressive with Mark - trying to get him in various holds - and also, in the bizarre way he's pressing against Mark, quasi-sexual. 
Mark is BLANK-FACED. Just waiting for it to end. 
FADE OUT. 65. 
EXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE - DAY WIDE SHOT of the Foxcatcher estate. 
In the distance, a HELICOPTER approaches, the rotors getting louder and louder. 
CUT TO: EXT. FOXCATCHER LAWN - DAY The helicopter has LANDED, the rotors still WHIRRING LOUDLY. (We won't hear dialogue in the following sequence.) DAVE and NANCY and the kids descend from the helicopter, GREETED warmly by the wrestling team. 
MARK IS ABSENT. Du Pont emerges from the Big House, trailed by Brandon. 
WE SEE du Pont notice what a warm reception Dave gets from the team. 
He comes down the steps, greets Dave and the family. 
CLOSE ON: Mark, who's at the very far end of the lawn, just inside the ring of trees, WATCHING. His HEAD is COMPLETELY SHAVED. MARK'S POV: Brandon and the team escort Nancy and the kids toward their new home. 
Du Pont and Dave ascend the Big House steps together. 
Du Pont puts his arm around Dave's shoulder. 
Far away, the Big House front door CLOSES. CUT TO: I/E. 
FRONT DOOR/THE CHALET - EARLY EVENING The door OPENS. Mark has opened it from the inside. 
He's looking out at: Dave, on his porch. 
Beat. 
DAVE Hey. 
MARK Hey, Dave. 
DAVE How you doing? 
MARK Good. 
I'm good. 
DAVE I hadn't seen you yet. 
I just want to make sure everything's okay. 66. 
MARK Yeah. 
I'm just concentrating. 
Trials are in 50 days. 
Silence. 
DAVE You know, Nancy and the kids are here. 
MARK How they doing? 
DAVE Good. 
You should stop in, say hi. 
MARK I will. (BEAT) I will. 
As the brothers stand in the doorway looking at each other, PRELAP: the sound of a GUNSHOT. CUT TO: EXT. FOXCATCHER WOODS - DAY A deer STAGGERS. It's been hit by a rifle shot. 
It stumbles, starts to move away. 
REVERSE onto Dave, holding his RIFLE. He's hunting with Dan Bane and TWO WRESTLERS we don't recognize (recruited by him in the few weeks he's been there.) Dave FIRES again. 
HEAR: opening of THE DOOBIE BROTHERS' "Listen to the Music" CUT TO: EXT. BACKYARD/DAVE AND NANCY'S HOUSE/FOXCATCHER - DAY A BOOMBOX plays The Doobie Brothers. 
The deer CARCASS hangs from a large tree. 
Dave SKINS it with a long knife. 
Dave's son, Alex, sits on the picnic table, watching. 
Danielle runs around the yard with some of the other wrestlers' kids. 
CUT TO: 67. 
EXT. BACKYARD/DAVE AND NANCY'S HOUSE - EVENING MUSIC in the background. 
The (now dozen or so) wrestlers and their families are gathered around the picnic table, the keg, the roasting deer on the SPIT over the fire. 
Du Pont is at the table. 
Mark stays very much ON THE PERIPHERY of the group. 
Dave's holding court at the table - in front of a huge platter of venison steaks - DAVE There's this big match between an American and a Russian. 
The Russian is a monster, never lost, kills everybody with this hold called The Pretzel. 
So the American coach tells his wrestler, "Listen, whatever you do don't let this guy get you in The Pretzel or you're dead." Sure enough, match starts, the Russian gets him in The Pretzel. 
There are smiles around the table. 
DAVE (CONT'D) The coach buries his head in his hands because he know's it's all over. 
Suddenly, he hears the crowd roar. 
When he looks up the Russian is flying through the air - he lands on his back, the American jumps him. 
Pins him. 
Boom. 
The match is over. 
Du Pont is studying Dave intently, fascinated by the hold he has on people - the attention he gets. 
DAVE (CONT'D) "Nobody's ever gotten out of The Pretzel," the coach says afterward, "How'd you do it?" "Well, Coach, I was just about to give up when I opened my eyes and there was this big hairy pair of balls right in front of my face. 
I had nothing to lose, so with my last ounce of strength I craned my neck and bit those babies as hard as I could." (SOME LAUGHS) The coach says, "And that did the trick?" (LOW) (MORE) 68. 
DAVE (CONT'D) "Coach, you'd be surprised how motivated you get when you bite your own balls." Everyone CRACKS UP. Du Pont WATCHES, trying to discern what makes this man so effortlessly magnetic. 
Then du Pont laughs loudest of all. 
CUT TO: INT. FOXCATCHER GYM - DAY The dozen wrestlers are spread out on the mats, in pairs, wrestling. 
Dave walks among them. 
He moves close to Springer, giving instruction. 
Du Pont, in sweats and a whistle, lurks nearby. 
Mark's off against the wall, putting on weightlifting gloves. 
DAVE He gives you opportunity, jump on it. 
Hard. 
Drive him down. 
DU PONT No mercy! Dave looks at du Pont, surprised by the comment - that John's actually behaving as if he's coaching. 
Dave looks at some of the wrestlers, realizes this is the norm. 
He laughs, pats du Pont on the back. 
DAVE (to the wrestlers) Okay. 
Okay. 
You heard the Head Coach. 
No mercy. 
Mark walks out of the wrestling room to the weight room. 
Du Pont is thrilled to be validated for a moment. 
Then - DAVE (CONT'D) (to du Pont) Would you give us a little room? 
Just stand over there for a sec... (turns to Springer) SPRINGER - Du Pont obeys, SHUFFLES off to the side. 
Fluidly, expertly, Dave talks and wrestles through a series of moves with Springer. (MORE) 69. 
DAVE (CONT'D) - when he grabs for your elbow, goes for head position - your hand on his wrist needs to come up immediately, suck his arm to your chest, right hook over the top for the headlock, take him down, drive him down - Du Pont watches the master work for several moments. 
DAVE (CONT'D) - you see him commit you make him PAY - Du Pont clearly has nothing to contribute. 
He claps. 
DU PONT Keep it up, gentlemen. 
Largely ignored, he drifts off into the weight room. 
CUT TO: INT. WEIGHT ROOM/FOXCATCHER GYM - CONTINUOUS Mark sits on the LEG-PRESS, pressing an enormous amount of weight - repeatedly - straining, pushing himself. 
Du Pont enters. 
Mark tries to ignore him, continues to press the huge stack of weights. 
DU PONT Your brother's taking the reins. 
Leading. 
Mark finishes his set, stares straight ahead, catching his breath. 
DU PONT (CONT'D) You've got more in you than that. 
Mark turns his gaze to du Pont. 
SILENCE. Du Pont walks over behind him, starts massaging Mark's shoulders. 
DU PONT (CONT'D) You've got to dig deep. 
Find out what's inside. 
Discover what you're made of. 
MARK (QUIET) Please don't do that. 70. 
Du Pont keeps massaging. 
Mark glances towards the wrestling room. 
DU PONT Conquer your demons, Mark. 
CONQUER - MARK (QUIET) - Please. 
I'm asking you to not... 
Dave is coming in the direction of the weight room. 
Mark STANDS and walks out of the gym. 
Du Pont turns and sees Dave come through the doorway. 
CUT TO: INT. THE CHALET - LATER CU on TV screen: Mark being taken down by a wrestler. 
The image pauses, plays again. 
And again. 
Mark sits in front of the screen, watching this sequence, over and over. 
Dave walks in through the open door. 
Mark doesn't acknowledge him. 
DAVE Why'd you take off so suddenly? 
MARK (STILL WATCHING) Need to study up. 
Fix some weakness. 
DAVE You been doing this since you left? 
MARK Pretty much. 
Beat. 
Dave stands there as Mark keeps watching. 
DAVE What's going on with you and John? 
MARK (STILL WATCHING) Nothing's going on. (BEAT) What does that mean? 71. 
DAVE You seemed kind of upset in the gym. 
MARK (STILL WATCHING) The fuck you talking about? 
DU PONT He was talking to you about something and you seemed pretty upset. (THEN) What was he saying to you? 
MARK I don't know what you're talking about. 
Beat. 
DAVE Okay. 
You want me to leave you alone, I'll leave you alone. 
You decide you want to talk, you know where to find me. 
Dave walks out. 
Mark keeps watching his videotape. 
CUT TO: I/E. 
DU PONT'S CAR/FOXCATCHER - NEXT MORNING Du Pont drives his black Mercury. 
He's wearing what looks like an antique Revolutionary War General's battle COAT over a Foxcatcher t-shirt. 
There are a couple of MUSKETS in the back seat, another COAT. CUT TO: EXT. DAVE'S HOUSE/FOXCATCHER - SAME TIME Dave's got the hood of his car up. 
He's showing Alex how to change the oil filter. 
Danielle picks flowers in the yard and brings them to Nancy on the steps. 
Du Pont pulls up in his car, gets out with the car running. 
DU PONT David Schultz. 
Dave. 
Dave looks around the open hood. 72. 
DAVE Hey, Coach. 
DU PONT I'd like to show you something. 
Why don't you hop in? 
It's more than a little odd that du Pont hasn't acknowledged anyone else. 
DAVE WELL - DU PONT - Need to show you something. 
At the battlefield. 
Come. 
Sit. 
Come. 
DAVE You know what, Coach? 
It's Sunday. 
Family time. 
Du Pont stands there as if he hasn't quite registered what Dave said. 
Beat. 
Beat. 
Nancy calls out from the steps. 
NANCY Good morning, John. 
Du Pont looks over at her as if he's just noticed her presence. 
DU PONT Family time. 
Ah. Very good. 
He turns, gets back in his car. 
DU PONT (CONT'D) Good. 
Good family time. 
He drives off. 
Dave looks at Nancy. 
CUT TO: EXT. FOXCATCHER WOODS - NEXT MORNING Mark RUNS - alone, pushing himself, sprinting - through the woods, jumping rocks and fallen tree trunks. 
CUT TO: 73. 
INT. FOXCATCHER GYM - SAME TIME The wrestlers train on the mats. 
Du Pont patrols the perimeter, REPEATEDLY LOOKING TOWARD the doorway. 
Du Pont SEES someone entering and immediately begins acting coach-like, SHOUTING instruction, CLAPPING encouragement. 
WE NOW SEE who has entered: Mrs. 
Jean du Pont. 
She's WHEELED in by an attendant; another wheels the oxygen tank she's attached to. 
They park themselves by the wall. 
INTERCUT: Mark SPRINTS through the woods, breathing hard. 
BACK IN THE GYM: The wrestlers notice Jean, begin to stop what they're doing. 
Du Pont BLOWS HIS WHISTLE too loudly- DU PONT And.... break! Gentlemen, well done! Listen up. 
Team. 
Listen up. 
Several wrestlers GLANCE toward Dave to check his reaction to this. 
Dave NODS his head in du Pont's direction. 
DU PONT (CONT'D) A number of you will be travelling with me to the Olympic Trials in Pensacola next week. 
From the moment you leave these hallowed training grounds, you will be in competition. 
There's no lying in a fight. 
Who you think you are in the moments leading up to a fight, and who you are when the fight begins - the truth will become abundantly clear. 
Jean du Pont watches her son. 
DU PONT (CONT'D) Raul Garcia, come up here for a moment. 
No one moves. 
He gestures at Garcia. 
DU PONT (CONT'D) Raul. 
Gecko. 
Come. 
GARCIA (mutters under his breath) My fucking name's Roberto, dickweed. 74. 
Springer smiles. 
Garcia stands. 
He's clearly the SMALLEST WRESTLER in the room. 
He approaches du Pont. 
INTERCUT: Mark sprinting through the woods. 
BACK IN THE GYM: DU PONT Muchas gracias, compadre. (gestures to the mat) Por favor. 
Garcia gets in the down position. 
Du Pont kneels next to him, his arms hovering over him, not yet grabbing on. 
DU PONT (CONT'D) The period begins before the whistle blows, when the other wrestler feels you above him, feels your purpose. 
Jean watches her son, not betraying any emotion. 
DU PONT (CONT'D) Then... the whistle blows! Du Pont grabs onto Garcia. 
Tries to flip him. 
He can't move him at all. 
TOTAL SILENCE, except for Du Pont grunting. 
Mrs. 
Du Pont, stoic - watches her son. 
Then she signals to her attendant to take her away. 
She's wheeled out. 
Du Pont sees her go. 
FADE OUT. INT. WRESTLING ARENA/PENSACOLA - DAY Dave wrestles. 
He's having trouble with a younger wrestler. 
Mark stretches by the wall, alone, trying to concentrate on his upcoming match. 
He keeps glancing over at his struggling brother, and at du Pont in Dave's corner.

Mark's struggling. 
We see a vulnerability we haven't seen before - something lost or disoriented. 
Dave shouts from the corner. 
DAVE Get after him, Mark! Shoot low!... 
Du Pont, BEING FILMED, claps, calls out instruction - DU PONT Need to get after him, there. 
Low low low. 
CUT TO: In between periods, Mark sits in the chair in his corner while Dave gets in his face, coaching. 
But all Mark can pay attention to is du Pont clumsily FANNING him with a towel. 
DAVE He's open to the left. 
He leaves his entire left side open. 
You gotta get after that fucker! Make him pay. 
Now or never... 
CUT TO: Mark's back out on the mat. 
It's not working. 
Mark gets PINNED. The wrestlers stand. 
The ref holds both of their hands, RAISES Chipparelli's arm. 
He turns them around, raises Chipparelli's arm again. 
Mark walks off the mat. 
Dave tries to console him. 
DAVE (CONT'D) Double elimination, buddy. 
You'll get it back. 
DU PONT Next time, Mark. 
A good effort. 76. 
Mark walks right past them, off the mats. 
We TRAIL him, staying with him as he walks straight out the arena door.

DELIVERY TUNNEL/WRESTLING ARENA - CONTINUOUS Mark's alone here. 
He BANGS his head against the cement wall, smashing it repeatedly. 
He screams at himself. 
He punches himself. 
Punishment for losing. 
CUT TO: INT. MARK'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY Mark, still in his wrestling clothes, sits on the edge of his bed in front of a ROOM SERVICE CART loaded with food. 
His face is bloody. 
He gorges himself on fried chicken, sandwiches, french fries. 
CUT TO: INT. MARK'S HOTEL ROOM - LATER Mark's on his knees at the room MINI-BAR, having discovered the Kit-Kat's, M&Ms. TV's on, place is a wreck. 
A KNOCK at the door. 
LOUDER. Mark looks through the peephole. 
His POV: DAVE Open up - I know you're in there. 
Mark walks away from the door. 
DAVE (CONT'D) Mark. 
I'm gonna kick it in if you don't open it. 
Dave POUNDS hard, seriously rattling the doorframe. 
DAVE (CONT'D) Mark! Mark doesn't move. 
Dave starts to KICK IN the door - once, twice - it might break. 
Mark goes to the door and opens it. 
SILENCE as the brothers stand there looking at each other. 77. 
DAVE (CONT'D) What's going on with you? 
You got a match in four hours. (BEAT) What happened to your face? 
Mark walks away, sits on the bed. 
Dave comes in, surveys the room - dishes on the room-service cart, open mini-bar. 
DAVE (CONT'D) Jesus Christ, tell me you didn't eat all this. (NO ANSWER) You got to weigh in before every match. 
MARK I'm done. 
DAVE What does that mean? 
MARK It's over. 
I'm done. 
You lost. 
I lost. 
It's over. 
Dave walks over to Mark, and CUFFS him, hard, on the side of the head. 
He hits him again. 
Hard. 
DAVE Look at me. 
Look at me. 
You have a chance to do what no wrestler's done since 1904. 
Not one. 
If you think I'm gonna let you throw away a chance to win back-to-back Olympic golds you're fucking crazy. 
Dave CUFFS him again, harder. 
DAVE (CONT'D) Do you know what I'd give to have the extra years you've got? 
To have one more shot? 
To not have to start coaching full time? 
Do you?! (hits him again) I'm done, Mark. 
I've lost a step. 
You haven't. 
I will kick the shit out of you. 
I will lift you up and personally throw you out on that mat to take what's yours - what we've been training for since high school. 
And I will be on your ass every day from here to South Korea. 78. 
Mark is silent, his face reddening. 
Staring straight ahead. 
DAVE (CONT'D) (QUIET NOW) I'm with you, Mark. 
You're not in this alone. 
Silence. 
Then, Mark stands and the CAMERA follows him into the bathroom. 
As he sticks his fingers down his throat and leans over the toilet bowl to throw up, CUT TO: INT. WEIGH-IN ROOM - DAY Mark steps on the scale. 
Dave watches. 
The balance shoots up, making a metallic clank. 
DAVE (under his breath) Shit. 
The official MOVES the slide weight up from 82 KILOS to... 
OFFICIAL 87 kilos. 
DAVE How long does he have to make weight? 
The official glances up at the CLOCK. OFFICIAL Weigh-in period ends at 3:30pm.

DAVE C'mon, fat boy, you got 90 minutes to cut 12 pounds. 
CUT TO: INT. WORK-OUT ROOM - DAY Mark PEDALS furiously on a STATIONARY BIKE, wearing five layers of sweats and fleeces with PLASTICS on top. 
We can see how much Mark is perspiring by the POOLS OF SWEAT which are collecting up his arms. 
Dave eggs him on as he shoves TINY PIECES of ICE up Mark's nose to keep him from overheating. 79. 
Du Pont walks in the far side, clapping, calling out - DU PONT Here you are. 
I've been looking all over for you -- Dave immediately trots over to du Pont, heading him off. 
We SEE their conversation from Mark's POV (we'll hear only pieces of it): Dave explains how Mark needs to be left alone. 
Du Pont resists at first; Dave is gentle but firm. 
He tells du Pont he shouldn't be in Mark's corner right now. 
Finally, du Pont turns and WALKS OUT. Dave turns back toward Mark. 
Mark puts his head down and PEDALS even harder. 
CUT TO: INT. WEIGH IN ROOM - DAY C/U on the CLOCK: 3:29. 
The weigh-in official CLOSES his log book.

He's 30 GRAMS OVERWEIGHT (5 ounces). 
He steps off, and Dave helps PEEL his singlet off. 
He gets back on the scale naked. 
The official slides the weight bar... 3 GRAMS OVER. Dave grabs Mark. 
DAVE (CONT'D) Come here.

Dave SQUEEGEES sweat off Mark's naked body with the card. 
Scraping him down. 
He helps Mark back on the scale. 
The pointer bobs, finally reaches equilibrium. 
OFFICIAL 82 kilos. 80.

Mark just sits there. 
Not taking the drink.

DAVE YAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH! Dave's EXULTANT - leaping and screaming onto the mat - he grabs his brother in a BEAR HUG and LIFTS him off the mat. 
As Dave joyfully carries his exhausted, victorious brother around the mat, he glances over at where du Pont would be sitting. 
Empty seat. 
CUT TO: INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT Dave walks down the long hall checking door numbers. 
He stops to KNOCK on one. 
After a moment, Stan Beck opens the door. 
DAVE Hey, Stan. 81. 
STAN BECK Dave. 
What can I do for you? 
DAVE I'm having some trouble finding John. 
He's not in his room - STAN BECK - Right. 
DAVE - I wanted to check in with him. 
I had a kind of uncomfortable thing with John before the match this afternoon - Mark was in a really delicate place, and I had to ask John to not be in his corner. 
I just wanted to make sure he's okay with everything. 
And that he's happy with the result. 
With how things turned out. 
STAN BECK Dave. 
Mr. du Pont's mother died this morning. 
He flew home to Philadelphia earlier today.

GUARD Can I help you? 
DAVE (leaning across Nancy) What's going on? 
GUARD How can I help you? 
DAVE We live here.

DAVE Are you serious? 
GUARD Please. 
They hand over their driver's licences. 
Mark reaches to hand his over from the back seat - DAVE (TO GUARD) - this guy just made the Olympic team. 
No response. 
The Guard takes the ID's into the guardhouse. 
Mark looks out his window: patrolling the roof of the main house, we can see PLAINCLOTHES SECURITY GUARDS. One of them speaks into a microphone in his cuff. 
The Guard returns. 
Hands back their ID's. 
And hands Dave an ENVELOPE. GUARD This is for you, sir. 
CUT TO: EXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE/THE CHALET - AFTERNOON Mark lifts his duffel bag from the back of Dave's car.

DAVE You got it. 
Mark starts off, then turns quickly - MARK Wait - your house, right? 
Dave has to laugh. 
DAVE Congrats, my brother. 
As Mark walks into the Chalet, he looks over toward the Big House, where he can see a SECURITY DETAIL fanned out on the lawn, sweeping the ground with metal detectors. 
IN THE CAR: Dave looks down at envelope in his hand. 
NANCY What you got, baby? 
Opens it.

INT. FOXCATCHER GYM - MORNING Wrestlers warm up, work out, lift weights. 
Dave and Mark train intensively together, doing TAKE-DOWN DRILLS. Mark executes, Dave murmurs instruction to Mark, they do the drill again. 
Du Pont WALKS IN THE GYM, trailed by the his Plainclothes Security Guard and Stan. 
Du Pont looks like he hasn't showered in a few days. 
Dave moves toward John, offering greetings and condolences -- "How you doing there, Coach," "Sorry to hear about your mother, sir," etc. 
Du Pont brushes off the offers of sympathy - DU PONT No no. 
All's fine. 
There's work to be done. (CLAPS) Back to work, gentlemen. 
As they go back to their drills, John stays on the perimeter, watching Mark, STARING at them. 
It's disconcerting. 
Dave moves back to work with Mark. 
DAVE Mark. 
Focus. 
Look at me. (Mark looks at him) Focus on me. (MARK NODS) You here? (MARK NODS) Let's run it again. 
Mark tries to run the takedown, Dave escapes, he spins on Mark and takes him down hard. 
As they stand up, Dave smacks MARK - DAVE (CONT'D) Get your head on straight and do this. 
Du Pont walks over. 
Mark can barely look at him. 
Du Pont stops close to Mark. 
Mark looks to Dave to save him from this. 
Dave's clearly caught in the middle. 
Mark looks down, closes his eyes as if in pain. 
Du Pont moves close to Dave, speaking to him so Mark can hear - 86. 
DU PONT If you and I can't get him there, no one can. 
We're in this together. 
After a long moment, du Pont moves off the mat. 
He starts to stretch nearby. 
As Dave tries to get Mark back to work, du Pont starts to JOG around the perimeter of the gym. 
Mark's trying to keep it together, but it's clearly driving him insane. 
As du Pont jogs and jogs - PRELAP: DU PONT (V.O.) Our challenge... as coaches... as leaders. 
I have coached... and psychologically prepare... 
Our Mark Schultz. 
To capture Olympic Gold... 
CUT TO: INT. DU PONT'S OFFICE/BIG HOUSE - DAY C/U of du Pont. 
HE'S SPEAKING DIRECTLY TO CAMERA. We're not sure where we are yet. 
He speaks haltingly, with effort, trying to be authoritative. 
DU PONT ...I wear many hats. 
I am leader. 
Mentor. 
Father figure. 
Brother. 
Older brother. 
At times the younger... 
INT. DU PONT'S OFFICE/BIG HOUSE - DAY From a WIDER ANGLE, we see that he's being FILMED for the documentary. 
He wears his Foxcatcher sweat jacket with HEAD COACH and JOHN `Eagle' du PONT" stitched onto it. 
DU PONT It will not be easy. 
We have built... our family. 
Our obligation... is to build... winners... 
In life. 
To teach the secret... 
To build men who will... think of... 
Who will understand... the character traits... 
We must teach them... whether they will listen or no. 87. 
He's finished. 
Silence. 
He stares steadily into the camera. 
Then he twitches. 
CUT TO: EXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE/VARIOUS - NIGHT A SECURITY TEAM taps on the outside of the main house, listen to the walls with what look like giant STETHOSCOPES. THE CHALET: A HORSE, its mane unkempt and knotted, eats grass in the side yard. 
Lifting its head, it noses the side window. 
CUT TO: INT. BIG HOUSE/DU PONT'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON FRED COLE, with TWO OTHER OFFICIALS from USA WRESTLING, sits across from du Pont's desk. 
Dave's there, as is Stan Beck. 
John sits at his desk, CLEANING and OILING his pistol. 
A glass of SCOTCH next to it. 
FRED COLE We're so very sorry about your mother's passing. 
Du Pont doesn't look up, just meticulously cleans each part of the gun. 
Almost mumbling: DU PONT Yes. 
Very sad. 
Very sad days here. 
Here at the farm. 
He keeps his focus on the disassembled gun, wiping clean each piece. 
Silence, then - FRED COLE Well, whatever we can do. 
Silence. 
STAN BECK What we wanted to discuss... 
Mr. Du Pont spends a significant amount of money for wrestlers' training here at Foxcatcher. 
Now - in addition - he'd like to make a sizable direct donation to USA Wrestling. (THEN) This money would come with conditions. (MORE) 88. 
STAN BECK (CONT'D) First: that you will start to offer Foxcatcher Farms - with the Golden Eagle as Head Coach, and Dave Schultz as Coach - as an alternative to Colorado Springs for wrestlers to train. 
FRED COLE May I ask what sort of a donation we're discussing? 
STAN BECK Four hundred thousand dollars. 
Fred chokes on his glass of water. 
STAN BECK (CONT'D) Second: that the du Pont family name be on all Olympic wrestling singlets and sweatsuits. 
DU PONT (under his breath) And gym bags. 
STAN BECK And gym bags. 
Beat. 
Fred glances at his fellow officials. 
CUT TO: EXT. FOXCATCHER/WOODS - SAME TIME Mark sprints through the woods, breathing hard. 
He emerges from the ring of trees onto the lawn near the Big House. 
He's immediately brought up short as SEVERAL SECURITY GUARDS come towards him, hands up -- PLAINCLOTHES SECURITY GUARD Sir! Please turn around and go back the way you came. 
MARK (GASPING) What's going on? 
PLAINCLOTHES SECURITY GUARD Security. 
Please turn around and go back the way you came. 
Behind the guard, Mark can see a SECURITY DETAIL fanned out around the perimeter of the Big House. 89. 
MARK What -? 
PLAINCLOTHES SECURITY GUARD - We'll let you know when this area is open. 
Please turn around and go back the way you came. 
Mark's confused, still breathing hard. 
After a moment, he turns and walks off into the woods. 
CUT TO: INT. BIG HOUSE/DU PONT'S OFFICE - SAME TIME STAN BECK We believe that Eagle has earned the right to be named to the official roster of Olympic coaches at Seoul. 
Which means he would be in Mark Schultz's corner throughout the games. 
Fred looks over at Dave. 
FRED COLE We'll all, of course, just need to get him to sign off on this. 
STAN BECK You can take care of that? 
DAVE I can try. 
CUT TO: INT. FOXCATCHER GYM - MORNING Dave and the other wrestlers warm up, stretch, run drills. 
Mark walks into the gym in streetclothes, stays near the entrance. 
Dave senses that something's going on with his brother, walks over to him. 
DAVE You're late. 
MARK Were you in the Big House yesterday? 90. 
DAVE For a little while. 
MARK In the afternoon? 
Because I got turned away when I came within fifty yards of the house. (THEN) What were you doing there? 
DAVE I'm a coach here. 
I get paid by John. 
I was meeting with John. 
MARK About what? 
DAVE Mark. 
Get dressed. 
MARK He's weakening me. 
DAVE What are you talking about? 
MARK I talked to Bachman at SMU last night. 
He says they're expanding the program. 
There'll be room for both of us in the fall - DAVE - Mark - MARK - I told him we could all get on the phone next weekend - DAVE - You need to focus on what's happening a month from now. 
Not - MARK - SMU's gonna make a move, they're gonna take a run at it - we can be there at the beginning - DAVE - Don't do this. 
Don't do it. 
Stay clear about what we're working for. 91. 
MARK - I can't do this anymore. 
I can't do it - DAVE - It's not the time, Mark - MARK - John's killing me here - DAVE - He's not killing you - MARK - If we at least let Bachman know by the end of the week we'll have a place to go to after - DAVE - Stop. 
Stop it! Long beat as Dave looks at Mark. 
As gently as he can: DAVE (CONT'D) I will make sure you're taken care of after Seoul. 
I'll talk to John - whatever you decide: you want to stay, you want to go - I'll make sure you're taken care of. 
Mark's looking at his brother, something dawning on him for the first time. 
MARK You're not thinking of staying here...? 
DAVE I don't know, Mark. 
The schools are great, the kids are happy. 
They have eight hundred acres to run around in... 
Mark's at a complete loss. 
Just when he'd reconnected with his brother, it seems they'll be separated again. 
DAVE (CONT'D) If you win next month you're in a class by yourself, you write your own ticket. 
You live your own life however you want. 
Focus on that. 92. 
MARK (QUIETLY) My own life. 
DAVE That's right. 
MARK And you'll be here. 
DAVE I'll be here. 
Whenever you need me. 
Mark seems lost. 
Dave pats him on the shoulder and turns to walk toward his office. 
Mark watches him walk away, then - MARK What's on your forehead? 
DAVE What? 
MARK It says kids. 
DAVE To remind me to pick up the kids from school. 
MARK What does that mean? 
When are you gonna you see your own forehead? 
DAVE I don't have to. 
You just told me. 
On Mark, PRELAP: CORPORAL Here we go, sir. 
Five tons of fun. 
CUT TO: EXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE - MORNING An M-113 Armored Personnel Carrier (APC) is off-loaded from the back of a wide-load army trailer. 
A DELIVERY CORPORAL directs the operation. 
Du Pont watches. 
CORPORAL That's one beautiful vehicle. 
The CORPORAL watches du Pont climb atop the APC. 93. 
DU PONT Where's the grenade launcher? 
CORPORAL I'm sorry? 
DU PONT The 40mm grenade launcher that's supposed to be mounted up here. 
The Corporal pages through the sheets of his delivery order. 
CORPORAL I don't know, sir. 
I don't... 
I don't see anything in the order - DU PONT - It goes right here. 
Right here. 
CORPORAL Yes, it does. 
It does mount right there on the top. 
DU PONT So where is it?

He TURNS IT ON, the engine roaring to life. 
CUT TO: 94. 
INT. FOXCATCHER GYM - SAME TIME Dave is being interviewed for the documentary. 
He stands in his workout clothes, in front of the camera crew. 
Some of the wrestlers work out behind him. 
Dave's reading much of what he says from CUE CARDS held near the camera. 
DAVE My name's Dave Schultz. 
I'm Coach and head of recruiting here at Foxcatcher, under Head Coach John "Eagle" du Pont - CUT TO: EXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE - SAME TIME Dave's voice continues - DAVE (V.O.) - Coach du Pont, uh, understands excellence, he represents... excellence, he expects it from his ATHLETES - Du Pont drives the APC over a little ridge and starts down a long slope toward the POND. CUT TO: INT. FOXCATCHER GYM - SAME TIME DAVE (halting; trying so hard) - His... commitment to this sport is complete. 
He's made himself um, an... an expert in the sport of wrestling... 
Dave, who's been so good at playing along, takes it too far even for himself. 
As he says the next bit, he stumbles over his words - DAVE (CONT'D) Eagle is indispensable to - uh - what it... to - what we're trying to accomplish here. (looks down, UNCOMFORTABLE) We... consider John... (QUIETLY) one of us. (MORE) 95. 
DAVE (CONT'D) (SO QUIETLY) One of us. 
CUT TO: EXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE - SAME TIME Du Pont drives the APC down the slope, into the POND. He continues driving as the tank goes lower and lower in the water -- the water covers the vehicle, then his torso, his neck, his head. 
And he's gone. 
Completely submerged. 
Beat. 
Beat. 
The surface of the water is still. 
Beat. 
Du Pont BREAKS the surface. 
He looks around, then swims slowly to shore. 
The tank remains on the bottom of the pond. 
CUT TO: INT. DU PONT'S OFFICE - DAY Dave and Mark sit on the couch across from Stan Beck and du Pont. 
Dave is firm and clear, but entirely diplomatic. 
Du Pont looks dishevelled, he won't meet anyone's gaze. 
We can see the POSTER of Mark hanging on the wall. 
DAVE I'll commit to remaining at Foxcatcher so long as John wants me here, but only if my brother is taken care of. 
STAN BECK Taken care of how? 
DAVE So long as I'm here, Mark will continue to be paid. 
STAN BECK Paid what? 
DAVE His full salary. 
STAN BECK You want him paid even if he leaves? 
What if he quits? 
DAVE Whether or not he chooses to stay. 
That's right. 96. 
Stan's incredulous. 
He glances over at du Pont, but his boss doesn't make eye contact. 
Stan turns back to Dave. 
STAN BECK You're making quite an assumption about the value of your presence here. 
DAVE You're welcome to test the theory. 
STAN BECK What does that mean? 
DAVE We can see how many wrestlers stay if I decide to go. (BEAT) I hope it doesn't come to that. (BEAT) I'd also ask John to understand the delicate nature of the lead-up to Seoul, and please allow Mark some space. 
Let him train just with me. 
Du Pont winces at this, but keeps quiet. 
STAN BECK (TO MARK) You're that determined to leave? 
Mark doesn't respond. 
DAVE He'd like the option. 
Stan leans over to du Pont and WHISPERS in his ear. 
It goes on for several seconds. 
Finally, du Pont NODS very slightly. 
STAN BECK First of all, Mark has always been free to train in whatever - DAVE - That's not exactly how it's - STAN BECK - Just a minute - you've had your say. 
DAVE Sorry. 97. 
STAN BECK - To train in whatever way is most effective for him. 
Eagle offers his advice and counsel. 
If Mark chooses to ignore it, that's his loss. (THEN) Mr. du Pont would be prepared to accept your financial terms, but only if we get an answer to what we proposed weeks ago. 
DAVE What's that? 
STAN BECK That John du Pont, Head Coach of Team Foxcatcher, be seated in Mark's corner throughout the Olympic Games. 
Mark looks at Dave. 
Quiet, betrayed -- MARK You've talked about this? 
DAVE I was waiting for the right moment to bring it up with you. 
You haven't exactly been in a receptive frame of mind. 
A long beat. 
Then Mark shrugs, and looks away from his brother. 
He's given up fighting this fight. 
STAN BECK All right, then. 
I guess we're done. 
Silence as they all just sit there. 
SMASH CUT TO: INT. OLYMPIC STADIUM/HALLWAY/SEOUL - DAY C/U on Mark, in his wrestling gear, looking disoriented, unfocused. 
He's in the hall right outside the locker room, just steps away from the WRESTLING ARENA. Dave's in his face - talking to him INTENSELY over the sounds of the crowd inside - 98. 
DAVE This is your moment to prove yourself - your moment to step out alone, away from everyone, into the spotlight. 
This has nothing to do with me, nothing to do with John - Du Pont hovers a few feet behind Dave, being filmed by his CAMERA CREW. Mark's eyes keep glancing over at him. 
DAVE (CONT'D) - nothing to do with anyone but you. 
This is you, Mark.

DOCUMENTARY DIRECTOR We've bought several time slots next week on local station WPHI - DU PONT (STILL MOVING) Good. 
DOCUMENTARY DIRECTOR - Several late night slots, of course, but there was also an open afternoon half-hour, directly after "The Edge of Night." That should be a good one - Du Pont continues right out the door, down the hallway, not even turning to face him.

THE END
AMERICAN SNIPER Written by Jason Hall Based on the book by Chris Kyle with Scott McEwen and Jim DeFelice All gave some. 
Some gave all. 1 OVER BLACK 1 The groan of tank treads drowns out THE CALL TO PRAYER as an entire MARINE COMPANY advances over the top of us. 2 EXT. STREET, FALLUJAH, IRAQ - DAY 2 The sun melts over squat residences on a narrow street.

CHRIS KYLE Her arms aren't swinging. 
She's carrying something. 
CROSS-HAIRS ON WOMAN as she pulls a cylindrical object from her robes. 
His vision obscured but-- CHRIS KYLE She just pulled a grenade. 
An RKG Russian grenade. 
I think she gave it to the kid. 
COMMANDING OFFICER (OS) --you say a woman and kid? (03.18.14) 3.

THE KID moves toward the convoy with the grenade. 
CHRIS KYLE (OC) Fuck-- MOTHER motions the Kid to hurry along (ECU)-- her robes flutter, trash blows in the street, the dust off her son's footsteps; all blowing the same direction. 
THE KID sprints toward the Marines. 
IN THE STREET YOUNG MARINES. Wading into war.

Breathe it down. 
He struggles to get calm, fighting for control. 
SFX: THUMP-THUMP THUMP-THUMP THUMP-- CROSS-HAIRS left of the running target, leading him, compensating for a dozen different considerations as-- He pauses upon exhale. 
The world goes quiet. 
Landscape pulses with color and focus. 
He stokes the trigger and-- THE BULLET Leaps from the barrel. 
Cracks like a whip. 
The .300 round hurls forward, glinting as it enters the flesh of-- A WHITE-TAIL BUCK It staggers, draws and topples to the ground. 
We are-- 4 EXT. HILLS, WEST TEXAS - PRE-DAWN 4 A field shrouded in fog. 
CHRIS KYLE(8) jumps from a deer blind, innocent and excited, running toward the buck. (03.18.14) 4. 
MAN'S VOICE Get back here. 
Chris stops, turns back. 
WAYNE KYLE, his father, is sturdy and earnest with mutton chops and Texas calm. 
WAYNE Don't ever leave your gun in the dirt. 
CHRIS Yes, sir. 
WAYNE Helluva shot, son. 
You got a gift. 
You're gonna make a fine hunter someday.

Our lives unfold before us like puzzling reflections in a mirror. 
But on the day we rise, we will see with clarity and understand the mystery of his ways-- JEFF(6), his reedy little brother, watches Chris slip the Bible in his pocket. 
Jeff laughs and gets smacked by-- DEBBIE, their mother. 
She wears big oval glasses and runs a wayward-boys home with that same steady hand. 7 OMITTED 7 8 INT. CHRIS' BEDROOM 8 Dust motes drift across a dresser, settling on a Pop- Warner football, that BLUE BIBLE, and METALLIC TOY SOLDIERS guarding the bullet casing from his first buck. 
WAYNE KYLE (VO) There are three types of people in this world. 
Sheep, wolves and sheepdogs. 
PUSH THROUGH the modest ranch house into-- 9 INT. DINING ROOM 9 WAYNE lectures his boys over venison. 
WAYNE KYLE Some people prefer to believe that evil doesn't exist in the world, and if it ever darkened their doorstep they wouldn't know how to protect themselves... those are the sheep. 
Jeff bites back tears. 
Chris looks troubled. 10 EXT. SCHOOLYARD 10 FROM THE BACK, we watch a BIG BULLY pummel a KID ON THE GROUND. His meaty fists coming down repeatedly as-- WAYNE KYLE (VO) Then you got predators who use violence to prey on the weak. 
They're the wolves. (03.18.14) 6. 
KID ON THE GROUND is JEFF, his nose bloody. 
PUSH TOWARD the fight--(ECU) blood flecks fly from the Bully's fist. 
WAYNE KYLE (VO) Then there are those blessed with the gift of aggression and an overpowering need to protect the flock.

Wind blows dirt off his palms and it plumes out across the land. 
WAYNE KYLE (VO) They are the sheepdog. 12 INT. DINING ROOM 12 WAYNE removes his belt and lays it on the table. 
CHRIS looks at it, worried. 
WAYNE KYLE Now we're not raising any sheep in this family and I will whoop your ass if you turn into a wolf-- DEBBY Wayne-- WAYNE But we take care of our own. 
And if someone picks a fight with you or bullies your brother, you have my permission to finish it. 
CHRIS The guy was picking on Jeff. 
WAYNE KYLE That true? 
JEFF (eye swollen) Yes sir... 
Yes, he was... (03.18.14) 7.

Chris shows the swollen knuckles of his hand, and nods. 
WAYNE Then you know who you are... 13 EXT. BARN 13 A GROWN MAN(CHRIS) exits the barn into the light of day.

JEFF Wasn't nobody there and you come away with a belt buckle too damn big to wear. 
What you supposed to do with it? (03.18.14) 8. 
CHRIS (grabs belt buckle) You're supposed to get laid with it. 
I'm gonna wear it in and see if it puts Sarah in the mood. 
JEFF A strong wind'd put Sarah in the mood. 
CHRIS Is that what they say? 
JEFF You know what they called her in high school-- CHRIS Don't say it.

CHRIS What the fuck-- SARAH steps out, his high school sweetheart all grown up. (03.18.14) 9. 
SARAH You said you wasn't coming home until tomorrow. 
CHRIS (wounded) Why would you do this? 
Cowboy leaves his shirt open flaunting a big hairy chest. 
SARAH Just let him out. 
He didn't know... 
CHRIS (shamed, steps aside) You didn't know? 
Cowboy doesn't answer. 
Chris SLAMS HIS HEAD into the refrigerator and ramps him out the front door. 
SARAH What the fuck is wrong with you! What'd you expect? 
You drag me out here then run off with your damn brother every weekend! CHRIS Get out. 
She jumps at the chance-- ripping clothes out of closets. 
SARAH You think you're a cowboy cause you rodeo? 
You're no cowboy. 
You're just a lousy ranch-hand and a shitty fuckin lay! The door slams behind her. 
Chris stares at the dent in the fridge, wounded. 
He opens it and pulls out a beer. 18 LATER 18 TV plays across Chris' drunken face. 
He lays on the sofa, a beer on his chest. 
JEFF is sprawled in a chair.

CHRIS I love water, hooyah. 
INSTRUCTOR ROLLE My ass you do. 
A CANDIDATE chokes a giggle. 
Rolle wheels around on-- RYAN JOB(24), a goofy, overweight Oregon kid who looks like he should be taking orders at a drive-thru window. 
INSTRUCTOR ROLLE Is that you giggling you fat fuck? 
Look at you. 
You're so fat they had to baptize you at Sea World. 
Your momma fat too? 
RYAN No sir, she's not. 
INSTRUCTOR ROLLE Don't lie to me! I bet we could use her panties as a parachute. 
What the fuck are you doing here fatboy? 
Do your feet get wet when you shower? 
When's the last time you saw your pecker? 
You're not a Seal, you're a fuckin Walrus. 
A big giggling Walrus. "Biggles" that's your new name-- "BIGGLES" is choking, coughing, struggling. 
ROLLE points to A BRASS BELL mounted on the back of a truck. 
INSTRUCTOR ROLLE --and that's your ticket home. 
Just drag your jelly-roll ass up and ring it and you'll be headed home to momma Shamu.

THE BELL RINGS. Chris jerks up, worried it was Biggles but-- an ATHLETIC CANDIDATE staggers off. 
INSTRUCTOR ROLLE That's a quitter. 
If he quits here, he'll quit in battle. 
When shit gets hairy he can't step up. 
You get shot, he can't pull you out. 
We're gonna weed out the quitters and see if we can find a warrior or two.

CANDIDATES crouch in a pit they dug, hugging oars, shivering with hypothermia. 
CHRIS stands over the ditch, trying to make INSTRUCTORS laugh to earn a place by the fire beside BIGGLES. CHRIS --and when I told her the condom broke she started crying and begging me to do something. 
And I'm a virgin, I don't know what to do, but I'd heard if you pour Coke up there you won't get pregnant-- (guys start laughing) So we went to 7-11, got a liter of Coke and drove back into the woods. 
She took her panties off and did a handstand against a tree but when I start pouring, she starts screaming, "it stings, it stings" but when I'd stop, she'd scream "no don't stop" and it's fizzing out and-- INSTRUCTORS in stitches.

He has a rhythmic grumble and a meat-eater's glare. "D" That's alright, sir.

INSTRUCTOR "TONY" No? "D" No, I'm new black. 
We run slow, jump low, swim good and shop at Gap. 
We make white folk proud then hose their ladies. "BIGGLES" still giggles, but he's looking fit as they chip away everything that isn't a Navy Seal. 
INSTRUCTOR "TONY" You hungry Biggles? 
I'd bet you'd eat the ass out of a low-flying duck. 
BIGGLES Hooyah.

MULONEY'S BAR - NIGHT 29 A crowd watches the boys toss darts at a bulls-eye drawn on DAUBER'S naked back. 
At the bar, BIGGLES and CHRIS-- CHRIS I'm gonna try and get into sniper school. 
BIGGLES Can you shoot? 
CHRIS I can hunt. 
And what's cooler than being a sniper? 
BIGGLES Blowing shit up. 
Blowing shit up is way cooler. 
A brunette steps to the bar. 
A sharp object with heavy eye-shadow and tight leather pants. 
This girl owns her sexuality but she's often been used for it. 
This is "TAYA". She is trying to ignore the advances of A SHORT NAVY GUY but he's relentless. 
Chris watches as (ECU)-- Taya's fingertips whiten, gripping her glass. 
Chris edges closer, she looks up, defensive-- but he just stands there, letting his protective presence be felt. 
DAPPER NAVY GUY (OC) Come on, just let me buy you a drink. (03.18.14) 16. 
TAYA (end of her rope) Will a drink make you 6 inches taller and charming? 
Will it make you not married? 
DAPPER NAVY GUY I'm not-- TAYA I watched you take your ring off. 
Don't be a scumbag. 
Go home. 
Navy Guy retreats. 
Taya sips her scotch, doesn't look up. 
CHRIS It could be the leather pants. 
TAYA Yeah? 
What kind of pants does a girl have to wear to be left alone? 
CHRIS Corduroy. 
She takes him in. 
Loose sweatshirt, no hair gel. 
TAYA Is that how it is with you guys-- suddenly single after three beers? 
CHRIS Only thing that happens to me after three beers is a fourth. 
TAYA That's great. 
A real red-neck. 
CHRIS I'm no redneck, I'm a Texan. 
TAYA What's the difference? 
CHRIS We ride horses, they ride their cousins. 
TAYA (almost laughs) What do you do for work? 
You look like military. (03.18.14) 17. 
CHRIS I polish dolphins. 
They have to be polished in captivity or their skin disintegrates. 
TAYA Do I look stupid to you? 
CHRIS To be honest, you look a little sad. 
She's taken aback by his observation. 
CHRIS So am I tall enough to buy you a drink? 
TAYA Not until you tell me what you do. 
CHRIS How about this: one shot, one answer. 
Chris passes her a shot. 
She throws it back, fierce. 
TAYA You're obviously military. 
What branch? 
CHRIS I'm just finishing BUD/S. 
TAYA Are you kidding me? 
You're a SEAL? CHRIS That was two questions... 
TAYA (two angry shots) I know all about you guys. 
My sister was engaged to a SEAL. CHRIS What's that mean you know all about us? 
TAYA You're a bunch of arrogant, self-centered pricks who think you can lie and do whatever the fuck you want. (pushes him a shot) I'd never date a SEAL. (03.18.14) 18. 
CHRIS (confused) How can you say we're self-centered? 
I'd lay down my life for my country. 
TAYA Why? 
CHRIS Cause it's the greatest country on earth and I believe it's worth protecting. (climbs off stool) I'm sorry this guy hurt your sister but that's not me. 
Nice talking to you. 
TAYA Where are you going? 
CHRIS You said you'd never date a SEAL, so I'm going home. 
TAYA I said I'd never marry one. 
It's a lie and they both know it. 
CHRIS Well in that case... what's your name? 
TAYA Taya. 
CHRIS Nice to meet you, Taya. 
I'm Chris Kyle. 
TAYA (liquor softening her) Pretty egotistical of you to think you can protect us all, isn't it Chris? 
CHRIS Our instructors say our biggest enemies are ego, liquor, and women. 
TAYA Sounds like you're under attack. 
She levels a look and downs another shot-- (03.18.14) 19. 30 EXT. MULRONEY'S BAR, PARKING LOT - LATER 30 Mist rolls in. 
Chris holds Taya's hair as she pukes. 
She takes a deep breath, wipes her mouth-- TAYA --I'm not going home with you so don't even think about it. 
She smiles, then turns to puke again-- 31 EXT. RANGE - "SNIPER SCHOOL" - CAMP BILLY MACHEN - DAY 31 An arid range with human-shaped targets. 
PETTY OFFICER TOSH (Irish/Japanese, nasty) walks past prone students. 
PO TOSH Feel breath filling every cell of your body. 
This is our ritual. 
We master our breath, we master our mind--- FIND CHRIS on .300 Win-Mag. 
Both eyes open. 
Dip packed. 
Deep breaths. 
His finger taking up the trigger-slack. 
PO TOSH --pulling the trigger will become an unconscious effort. 
You will be aware of it but not directing it. 
And as you exhale, find your natural respiratory pause and the space between heart-beats. 
Chris exhales, pauses, strokes-- BAM! 32 INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE 32 A ZOLOFT BROCHURE shows smiling faces. 
TAYA wears a suit- skirt and tries to mimic the esprit of the brochure. 
She leaves a box of samples with the RECEPTIONIST but her smile fades as she pulls her trolley to the door-- 33 INT. TAYA'S CONDO - DAY 33 Blades of light leak through closed blinds. 
Taya hides under blankets on the sofa. 
PHONE RINGS, goes to message: CHRIS (OS) It's me again. 
The guy whose shoes you puked on? 
I was thinking maybe you didn't get my last message. 
Or the one before that. 
So, I figured-- (03.18.14) 20. 
She snatches up the phone-- TAYA You figured what? --looking for a reason not to be alone. 34 EXT. RANGE - CAMP BILLY MACHEN - DAY 34 ON CHRIS, both eyes open looking downrange. 
PO TOSH (OC) Aim small, miss small. 
If you aim for his shirt button, you might miss by two inches. 
If you aim for his shirt, you miss by two feet. (over Chris, raises binocs) You better close those groupings, Kyle. 
Chris chases his breath, trying to focus, but-- 35 EXT. OCEANSIDE PIER - DUSK 35 PAN ACROSS a "target shoot" game to a bench overlooking surf. 
CHRIS and TAYA sit with a GIANT TEDDY BEAR. TAYA Did you always want to be a soldier? 
CHRIS I wanted to be a cowboy-- but I did that and I felt like I was meant for more. 
TAYA So you started rescuing girls from bars? 
CHRIS I rescued that bar from you. 
She smiles at his sweetness. 
CHRIS Do you like country music? 
TAYA Only when I'm depressed. 
CHRIS You want kids? (03.18.14) 21. 
TAYA Someday. 
My mom says I have a nose for picking the wrong men. 
CHRIS That's a shitty thing to tell a girl. 
TAYA I've proven her right. 
CHRIS But those wrong picks put you here. 
They made you who you are. 
And I like who you are. 
The Ferris wheel casts its glow on them. 
TAYA What happens when there's a real person on the other end of that gun? 
CHRIS (uncertain) I don't know... 
I just pray I can do my job if that day comes. 
It weighs on him. 
And she feels safe. 
BACK TO: 35A EXT. RANGE - CAMP BILLY MACHEN 35A PO TOSH (on spotting scope) stands over CHRIS. Mirage boils off the horizon at 35 degree angle, pushed by wind. 
BAM! Chris' shot hits the outer edge of target. 
PO TOSH Mirage is boiling at 35 degree angle. 
CHRIS Check. 
I'm dialed for windage. 
PO TOSH Hold right-four, up-two. 
BAM! He misses. 
It spits dirt. 
Not even close. 
PO TOSH Are we looking at the same target? (03.18.14) 22. 36 INT. TAYA'S CONDO - NIGHT 36 CHRIS sits on the couch, anxious, until TAYA appears in the hall in lingerie. 
She slinks closer, straddling him, determined to blow his mind but-- CHRIS You're trembling... 
TAYA I know. 
I don't... 
She finds his eyes. 
Finds her breath. 
CHRIS We don't have to do this... 
TAYA I want to. 
I do... 
He gently lifts her up and lays her across the couch. 
ANOTHER ANGLE Soft light on pale bodies. 
Taya writhes with impatient longing but Chris' steady hand forces her into the present. 
She's swept up, eyes filling with tears as he eases into her-- she gasps and arcs and draws him deeper. 36A EXT. RANGE - CAMP BILLY MACHEN 36A PO TOSH stands over CHRIS, fed up now. 
PO TOSH You need to shut your off-eye. 
CHRIS If I close my off-eye I can't see what's out there. 
PO TOSH (OC) There is nothing out there but a target. 
CHRIS Negative. 
There's something-- CHRIS POV (BOTH EYES VIEW) The circular scope floats over the target. 
Left of scope, a SWATCH OF GRASS doesn't sway like the rest. (03.18.14) 23. 
PO TOSH Give me 50 push-ups. 
Clear and safe. 
Push `em out. 
The scope drifts left of target-- BAM! A RATTLESNAKE is flung through the air, blown to shit, 500 yards out. 
CHRIS There it is. 
He sets the rifle aside and starts cranking out push-ups. 37 OMITTED 37 38 OMITTED 38 39 INT. BEDROOM - MORNING 39 Ethereal white sheets. 
Two bodies lay like spoons. 
Chris WHISPERS SOMETHING. Taya closes her eyes. 
A beat-- TAYA You hardly even know me. 
CHRIS I know enough. 
You're a package deal, babe. 
She stares at the wall. 
CHRIS What are you afraid of? 
TAYA Nothing. 
Everything. 
I don't know. 
What if it doesn't work out? 
She moves to stand. 
He holds her put. 
CHRIS I'm going to marry you, and we're going to start a family. 
TAYA You got it all planned out, don't you. 
CHRIS I love you. 
I'm done. (03.18.14) 24. 
TAYA (crushed by his sincerity) Well... you're gonna need a ring if you want to talk all tough like that. 
She accepts with a deep kiss and prances off with the sheet. 
He smiles and falls back onto the bed. 
The curtains dance in the morning light. 
Then-- TAYA (OS) Oh my god! No! Chris-- Chris bounds up, running into the next room. 
Taya stands in front of the television. 
They both watch as-- ON TV NEWS: THE SECOND PLANE hits the World Trade Center. 
It steals their breath. 
Chris hugs her close, trying to shield her from it.

CHRIS two-steps TAYA around the dance floor to Van Morrison's romantic "Someone Like You." Chris looks boyish and dapper and Taya is flush with beauty and promise. 
The moment is quietly sincere with the entire WEDDING PARTY watching when-- TAYA (her hand smudged with paint) What the hell is on your neck? 
She pulls at his collar to reveal GREEN SPRAY-PAINT upside his neck. 
CHRIS Would you believe me if I told you I was painted green and on an IV two hours ago? (03.18.14) 25. 
TAYA What do you-- Then she sees BIGGLES, DAUBER, "D" and SQUIRREL rolling with laughter at the bar, and remembers who she married. 
CHRIS (smiles) Package deal babe. 
He dances her away from them and pulls his jacket aside, flashing his boys the Trident pinned to his chest. 
AT THE BAR TONY bowls up; once their instructor, now their Chief. "D" What's the word, Chief? 
TONY (looks them over) It's on boys. 
Just got the call. 
They hoist their drinks, barking approval, "HOOYAH!" ON DANCE FLOOR Taya sees the nod from Biggles to Chris, we're going. 
She tenses up in his arms, her feet growing heavy. 
CHRIS They say it'll be over in 6 weeks. 
TAYA I'm so afraid. 
CHRIS Don't be afraid. 
It's all part of the plan. 
He pulls her close, HIS EYES FIXED on someone else-- TAYA Your heart is beating out of your chest. 
CHRIS (nods, looking past her) I'm not the only one going to war.

MARC LEE AO2 (26) is a poster-boy Navy Seal, soulful and handsome. 
He glows like a halo in a river full of shit. 
MARC LEE AQI have put a price on your heads and extremists from around the globe are flooding the borders to collect on it. 
The rig hits a pothole and faces clench expecting an IED. MARC LEE You snipers will be paired with a man to watch your back and inserted along the main road to do "overwatch" for 1st Marines going door to door. 
Your job is to protect those Marines at all costs. 
The truck battles to a stop. 
MARC LEE The city was evacuated. 
Any military-aged male still here, is here to kill you. 
Let's bring these boys in safe and get our asses back home.

A DOZEN MARINES are posted outside an apartment complex. 
WINSTON They got this sniper that's been hitting headshots from 500 yards out-- 46 INT. APARTMENT COMPLEX 46 An open atrium eight stories tall.

They start up the stairs. 46A OMITTED 46A 47 INT. APARTMENT, SIXTH FLOOR 47 Chris walks from APARTMENT TO APARTMENT, some vandalized, others untouched, checking sight-lines out windows.

He unzips and peels off into the bathroom. (03.18.14) 28. 
WINSTON (OS) Fuck, fuck-- WINSTON FIRES TWO ROUNDS in the bathroom. 
Chris pulls a Springfield .45 as-- A GOAT Bounds out of the bathroom, runs out the apartment door and leaps OVER THE RAILING, falling six floors.

Chris rubs red "shooter's strawberries" from his elbows. 
CHRIS They still got one of our guys. (03.18.14) 35.

CHRIS (shedding gear) You still read comic books? 
BIGGLES It's a fuckin graphic novel. 
Talk to me, man. 
Did you pop your cherry? 
A heaviness falls over Chris, then slowly-- CHRIS This kid didn't even have hair on his balls and his mom hands him a grenade-- sends him running off to kill Marines. 
BIGGLES (sees his hurt) You saw his balls? (03.18.14) 36. 
CHRIS It was evil, man.

OVERWATCH Chris takes over for a MARINE SNIPER in a window. 
MARINE SNIPER Haven't seen shit all day.

Exhale, pause, pull. 
A SHOT RINGS OUT. MARINE SNIPER (OS) (just offstage) --are you fucking serious? 
MARINE INTEL TRAILER CHRIS scrunches that EMPTY WATER BOTTLE, gratingly, as JAG OFFICERS continue the interrogation: JAG OFFICER His wife said he was carrying a Koran. 
CHRIS Well, I don't know what a Koran looks like but I can describe what he was carrying-- it was pressed metal, fired 7.62s and looked just like an AK-47.

The Legend here would like you to know that when it comes to sniping it's better to be lucky than good! Our boy here has a Texas horseshoe crammed so far up his ass that-- Chris flings a cafeteria tray at his head. 56 EXT. ROOFTOP - DAWN 56 In murky predawn light, CHRIS sits on a SATELLITE PHONE-- TAYA (OS) Have you killed anyone yet? 
CHRIS That's not how the call-home goes, babe. 
TAYA (OS) Don't be weird with me. 
Seriously. 
I want you to tell me everything. 
Chris covers the phone as distant gunfire chatters. 
INTER-CUT WITH: 57 INT. CHRIS & TAYA'S HOUSE, SAN DIEGO - SAME 57 TAYA sits in front of a partially assembled baby-crib with a six month baby bump. 
She turns down the TV. CHRIS There are things we can't say over the phone. 
TAYA (playful) You knocked me up and now I'm stuck here by myself assembling baby-cribs and you can't talk to me? 
That's the big plan? 
HIS CROSS-HAIRS track across a distant rooftop. 
Socks sway from a clothesline in a 5 knot breeze. 
TAYA You guys almost done over there yet? (03.18.14) 39. 
CHRIS I can't stop thinking about that pink silky thing you wore on our honeymoon... 
TAYA It's called a nightgown. 
CHRIS Yeah-- TAYA And three days is not a honeymoon. 
CHRIS It was a good three days. 
I miss you bad. 
TAYA (curls up in chair) You want me to talk dirty to you? 
CHRIS Yeah. 
But I got my gun in one hand and the phone in the other-- TAYA Well, you'll just have to decide what's more important. 
CHRIS You're horny preggers. 
TAYA Fat and horny. 
It's kinda disgusting. 
CHRIS You could be 300 pounds I'd still do you. 
She's touched, hormonal, starts crying. 
TAYA -So romantic. 
CHRIS How's my boy? 
TAYA Nobody said it's a boy-- CROSS-HAIRS TRACK INSURGENTS on the street; then linger on a parked car, measuring distance by height-- CHRIS I can't wait to see the way you are with him. 
You're gonna be incredible. (03.18.14) 40. 
TAYA (harbors doubt) How do you know? 
CHRIS I just know. 
I can see it. 
TAYA I hope you're right. 
Her face falls as-- TV NEWS shows the graphic of "American Death Toll in Iraq." The number is 835. 
TAYA (suddenly) Did your dad get hold of you? 
CHRIS I haven't checked any email. 
CROSS-HAIRS follow insurgents as they slip out of view. 
TAYA Shit. 
You need to call him. 
Hang up and-- CHRIS What happened? 
TAYA I'm so selfish. 
I wasn't even thinking-- CHRIS Taya. 
TAYA Your little brother deployed. 
CHRIS What happened to jump school? 
I thought-- TAYA He didn't get in. 
Just call your dad-- CHRIS Deployed where?

AQI, his mercenary army, are 5000 strong. 
They're trained well, paid well and waging the heaviest urban combat since Vietnam. 
FIND CHRIS in back, scanning heads for his brother Jeff. 
COL. GRONSKI Zarqawi and his Lieutenants are our highest priority. 
Only way to root them out is to go house-to-house until we find them, or someone who will reveal their whereabouts. 
We need to clear ten structures an hour. 
It's aggressive so we'll loosen things up with air support-- Chris looks to Marc Lee, ten structures an hour? 59 EXT. CAMP FALLUJAH - MORNING 59 The sun hangs like a blood-clot in the sky. 
Chris and Marc Lee are walking, TALKING LOW-- CHRIS These Marines rush in like they been doing, they'll get their asses shot off. 
MARC LEE They're Marines. 
They don't get the training we do. 
Half of them were civilians six months ago. 
Chris reacts, hearing him describing Jeff. (03.18.14) 42. 
CHRIS So let's coach them up. 
I'll show them how Team Guys do it and lead a unit in the street. 
MARC LEE Can't do. 
We need you on overwatch. 
CHRIS But if I was down in the street-- MARC LEE House-to-house is the deadliest job here. 
You got some kind of savior complex? 
Maybe. 
CHRIS I just wanna get the bad guys. 
And I can't shoot them if I can't see `em. 
MARC LEE You got a hot hand. 
These Marines all know your name now and they think they're invincible with you up there. 
CHRIS They're not-- MARC LEE They are if they believe they are. 
Just keep banging on the long-gun and let these ground-pounders sniff out Zarqawi.

He's from Syria. (03.18.14) 43. 
Chris steals a glance at him, processing this as-- CHRIS SCOPE POV KILO COMPANY MARINES JOG to a pink house with windows boarded up. 
One of the Marines looks like Jeff Kyle. 
CHRIS (keys mike) Once you make entry I can't see shit, so keep it slow and push through the target. "Jeff Marine" sets a charge, turns-- not Jeff. 
The door blows off. 
Marines rush in. 
GUNFIRE POPS. Marines rush back out, dragging a WOUNDED MARINE. CHRIS Fuck this-- I'm going down to clear houses with the Marines. 
You coming? 
GOAT No man. 
No. I like my life. 
I wanna make it home. 
I go fishing and do all kind of cool shit. 
It's not my job to knock down doors. 
Those guys picked the wrong fucking job. 
I ain't doing that shit. 
CHRIS (smiles) If I don't see you down there, you make sure I don't see you again. 61 INT. STREET, SOLDIER'S DISTRICT - MINUTES LATER 61 KILO COMPANY firing on the structure. "CPT. GILLESPIE" (smart, sunburned) is shouting "hold your fire" as-- CHRIS (bowls up) You wanna be a sniper?

CPT. GILLESPIE Hey, any Navy Seal is cool by me. "THOMPSON" (big, wobbly voice) nods, lugging an M240G. (03.18.14) 44. 
THOMPSON You're that guy. 
They're calling you The Legend. 
You got like 24 confirmed kills. 
He recognizes his way to gain entry, so he plays it up. 
CHRIS It's 32. 
But who's counting. 
THOMPSON That's badass. "SANCHEZ" (neck tattoos, Catholic) chimes in. 
SANCHEZ There's some boy in Bravo catching up. 
CHRIS KYLE (packs a dip) Y'all are meateaters for sure but I got a little training I could show you, some simple shit, that might just keep us above ground. 
What do you say? 
His need to protect cloaked beneath cool cowboy calm. 62 OMITTED 62 63 EXT. MICHIGAN STREET - OUTSIDE THE WIRE - DAY 63 KILO COMPANY are doing house-to-house.

He follows Chris into a room with sofas, exotic rugs and-- (03.18.14) 45. 
A KID(12) stands across the room with dark eyes and pronounced forehead, staring at Chris. 
CHRIS Down. 
Down! On the floor, now! THE KID is rocking on his heels like he's going to run. 
CHRIS I will fucking shoot you! Down! Get down-- FATHER OF KID (OS) No, please-- THE FATHER runs in, tall and bearded. 
Gillespie clocks him and he drops. 
The Kid screams like he's deaf. 
FATHER OF KID (from the floor) Please! He can't understand. 
Look at him-- GILLESPIE He does look a little retarded. 
CHRIS You were ordered to evacuate. 
Why are you still here? 
FATHER OF KID This is our home. 
I won't give it to them. 
Or to you. 
SANCHEZ pushes THREE WOMEN (in berkas) into the room. 
SANCHEZ I found these bitches in the back closet. 
FATHER OF KID I'm Sheikh al-Obeidi. 
You are my guest but please tell the others to come inside. 
If they are in the street he will know we have spoken. 
SANCHEZ This sand nig' want us in here so he can blow us up. 
Check his ass for a vest. 
A KETTLE whistles in the kitchen. 
Guns still trained. 
CHRIS Who will know we've spoken? (03.18.14) 46. 
SHEIK AL-OBEIDI/FATHER Your enemy is mine enemy. 
We share this. 
You understand? 
Chris studies the women, and lowers his gun. 
CHRIS Bring the other guys in. 
TIME CUT - LATER Chris and Gillespie sit with "SHEIK AL-OBEIDI" while the kid ("OMAR") plays with his father's hair. 
SHEIKH AL-OBEIDI If we talk to US soldiers he will come to our home and make examples of us-- CHRIS Who is he? 
I need a name. 
The Marine Interpreter aka "TERP" (20s, in mismatched camo, face bandanna) repeats the question. 
SHEIKH AL-OBEIDI The man who comes we call The Butcher. 
He is the despaired one, son of Shaytan-- Sheik mumbles in Arabic, fearing the words on his tongue. 
TERP He calls him - the pure flame of fire- . 
Basically, this man comes to their house and prey on the weak with hurt. 
CHRIS So he's some kind of enforcer? 
SHEIKH AL-OBEIDI Enforcer. 
Yes. 
Top soldier of Zarqawi. 
CHRIS (jumps) We want Zarqawi. 
Where do we find Zarqawi? 
OMAR CACKLES like a crow, playing peeking games. 
SHEIKH AL-OBEIDI If you find The Butcher you will see he reports direct to Zarqawi each day. 
An F-18 rips overhead. 
RADIO CHATTER. THOMPSON steps out-- (03.18.14) 47. 
CHRIS How do we find him? 
SHEIKH AL-OBEIDI You must understand the risk to us. 
TERP He will ask for money. 
SHEIKH AL-OBEIDI We need one hundred thousand US dollars. 
THE BOOM of distant ordinance shakes the structure. 
CHRIS We don't even have proof this guy exists. 
The Sheik grabs his wife, pulls her arm from her robe-- her hand has been hacked off, the stump healing. 
SHEIKH AL-OBEIDI Is this not proof? 
CHRIS I'm sorry. 
I want to help you. 
I do. 
But I need names, places, phone numbers-- THOMPSON (rushes in) Hey, we got a Marine unit pinned down in a house just uprange-- CHRIS Give me a name, Sheik. 
Give me something. 
THOMPSON They're out of ammo. 
If we don't go now-- Sheik stonewalling, Chris stands to go, fuck-- SHEIKH AL-OBEIDI "Amir Khalaf Fanus".

CORNHUSKER football posters on his wall. 
AGENT SHEAD I guess that translates to "pay me" in just about any language, doesn't it? 
CHRIS Yes sir, it does. 
MARC LEE And you're the secret squirrel with the cash, right? 
AGENT SHEAD (not amused) When you were having tea with Sheik al- Obedie did he tell you he ran a network of highway bandits before AQI moved in? 
CHRIS KYLE He left that part out. 
AGENT SHEAD That's AQI's racket now. 
Your Sheik got edged out. 
This could be blowback. 
CHRIS Or he could be upset The Butcher cut off his wife's hand. 
Either way, seems like you'd wanna explore it. 
Shead would rather not enter into this with them but-- he slides a white-board to reveal an AQI HIERARCHY. AGENT SHEAD This is your guy here. (points to photo directly under Zarqawi) We believe The Butcher is Zarqawi's number two man. 
THE BUTCHER is a squat, rawboned man with eyebrows forming a grizzled line over dark bloodshot eyes. 
CHRIS But you don't know his real name or you'd have it written up there. (03.18.14) 49. 
AGENT SHEAD We have several aliases-- (picks up phone, dialing) If "Fanus" is legit we go see the Sheik. 
MARC LEE He's asking for 100,000. 
AGENT SHEAD If he delivers the Butcher he'll get it. (into phone) This is Agent Shead, DIA, I need a name check on "Amir Khalaf Fanus." I'll wait. 
He kicks his feet up, like he runs the war. 
CHRIS If we're going back out, TEAM 3 could pull security-- AGENT SHEAD If we're humping money the head-shed will want contractors on it. (into phone) I'm here.

They say his weapon of choice is a drill. 
Chris looks to Marc Lee, eyes closed in prayer. 
When he opens them he sees Chris looking. 
The rig sways. 
MARC LEE I went to seminary school before I joined the Navy.

He looks up at her, holding Colton. 
TAYA I had to make sure you didn't have an Iraqi girlfriend sending sexy videos. 
He lightens, touching her, eyes drifting back to the TV. CHRIS This sniper is recording his kills. 
Mustafa. 
They sell these in the street. 
TAYA That day we were on the phone-- Chris nods, it was him. 
TAYA You're not protecting me by not talking about it. 
CHRIS I don't want you thinking about it. 
I don't need you worrying. 
TAYA My imagination is so much worse than anything you could tell me-- CHRIS (cutting her off) No, it's not. 
They're savages. 
TAYA Chris-- CHRIS They're fuckin savages. 
His blood pressure pulses on his unyielding face.. (03.18.14) 62. 
TAYA It's not about them, it's about us. (hands him baby) You have to make it back to us. 
Her eyes trail off him as she steps into the kitchen. 
Chris holds his son, taken with his ruddy innocence. 
Then the BEDOUIN MUSIC swells, his arms tighten around his son, and his eyes are drawn back to Mustafa. "SECOND TOUR" 80 EXT. AL TAQADDUM AIRBASE, IRAQ - DAY 80 The tail of a C-17 draws down. 
YOUNG MARINES file off leaving CHRIS, squinting into a dirty sunset as he tucks his ring away like he's stowing part of himself. 
MASTER CHIEF MARTIN (sharp-nosed, fit) Welcome home, Petty Officer Kyle. 
Colonel Jones is waiting. 
How was the flight? 
CHRIS KYLE Slower than Christmas. 
Chris is following him toward a Blackhawk when-- CHRIS Can you give me a second--? 
MASTER CHIEF MARTIN The colonel is waiting-- Chris is already striding across the tarmac toward-- A SQUAD OF MARINES Loading onto a C-17 weary, injured, heading home. 
JEFF KYLE doesn't see Chris until he has hands on him. 
CHRIS KYLE Hey, grunt-- Chris shakes him and pulls him into his arms. 
JEFF Chris? 
Jeff is slow to react, like he can't see past the atrocity branded on back of his eyeballs. (03.18.14) 63. 
CHRIS KYLE Y'alright? 
You in one piece? 
He looks him over, undamaged but for the eyes. 
MARINE LCPL Let's go, PFC Kyle. 
Move your ass. 
Marines on-board the C-17. 
Jeff is anxious, shifting-- CHRIS You okay? 
Jeff?-- JEFF I heard you're kickin ass our here. 
All the guys, that's what they say-- Chris fixes Jeff's collar: a tender gesture. 
JEFF You're my hero, bro. 
Always have been. 
MASTER CHIEF MARTIN Lets go, Kyle. 
Colonel's waiting-- JEFF (swollen with emotion) The Legend... 
The four massive turbo-engines on the C-17 kick-on. 
JEFF (over deafening noise) I'm gonna miss my ride. 
CHRIS KYLE What happened? 
JEFF I'm just tired, man.

CHRIS Dad too. 
He's proud of you. 
JEFF Fuck this place-- (03.18.14) 64.

COL. JONES You made Chief. 
Congratulations. 
CHRIS KYLE Thank you, sir. 
COL. JONES Gronski's gone. 
A lot of top-brass are. 
We're working off a new playbook now. 
The Blackhawk lifts off, ZOOMING across the desert floor. 
COL. JONES I've studied insurgencies for the last decade. 
I know every stone thrown since before the first century. 
These wars are won and lost in the minds of our enemy. 
He hands over an AQI BOUNTY POSTER with an illustration of a SNIPER RIFLE and GALLIC CROSS and a reward. 
COL. JONES That you? 
Chris rolls his sleeve, showing his Gallic Cross tattoo. 
COL. JONES You're now the most wanted man in Iraq. 
MASTER CHIEF MARTIN That's $80,000 on your head. 
CHRIS KYLE Don't tell my wife, she might take that number right about now. 
COL. JONES I understand you wanted to put together a direct-action squad to hunt The Butcher. (03.18.14) 65. 
CHRIS KYLE Yes, sir. 
COL. JONES We plugged the rat-hole that is Fallujah and flushed them into Ramadi. 
We got some intel indicating his area of operations. 
As they cross the Euphrates the SLUMS OF RAMADI are laid out before them like a blanket of chaos. 
COL. JONES I want you to put the fear of God in these savages, and find his ass. 82 INT. OP SEC TENT, SHARK BASE - NIGHT 82 CHRIS stands in front of Team Three, armed with a 60-inch monitor and a TuffBook. 
They're chanting, "Power-point." CHRIS You guys know how I hate this shit so shut your traps. 
Our target is Amir Khalaf Fanus aka The Butcher. (clicks first slide) We'll be heading in under cover of darkness, sector P13, north of the river-- They're cracking up. 
He turns to see his slide has been hijacked with A PHOTO OF HIS BACHELOR PARTY; the "best men" pose with a spray-painted groom. 
They look so young. 
Chris turns back to his men and, for a moment, their smiling faces appear immortal in the feeble light. 
TIME FADE Brief finished, TEAM THREE file out past Chris-- BIGGLES You give good power-point, Legend. --grabbing ass and cracking jokes until one remains. 
MARC LEE Is this thing bulletproof? (holds Chris' Bible) You never open it so I assumed... 
CHRIS KYLE God, country, family, right? (03.18.14) 66. 
MARC LEE You got a God? 
CHRIS KYLE You getting weird on me? 
MARC LEE We had this electric fence around our property in Oregon and us kids used to see who could grab it and hang on the longest. 
War feels like that, it puts lightning in your bones, makes it hard to hold on to anything else. 
CHRIS KYLE You need to sit this one out? 
MARC LEE I just wanna believe in what we're doing-- CHRIS KYLE Evil lives here, we've seen it. 
MARC LEE It lives everywhere-- CHRIS KYLE You want to invite these motherfuckers to come fight in San Diego? 
Or New York? 
We're protecting more than this dirt. 
Marc adopts his zeal, letting it fill him. 
MARC LEE Hooyah then. 
Lets go kill this fucker.

BIGGLES is ready to wedge the cat-claw when he sees keys hanging from the door. 
He grins and simply opens it-- 89 INT. CORNER APARTMENT, SIXTH FLOOR 89 A modest apartment. 
TEAM THREE have seated the family; A PROTECTIVE FATHER hugs his BOY(6) as his WIFE frets. 
CHRIS Tell em they won't be leaving till we do-- (hands Terp a photo) Ask if they seen him. 
TERP TRANSLATES, showing a PHOTO OF THE BUTCHER. LOOKING OUT WINDOW The RESTAURANT BELOW is boarded up with painted metal. 
BIGGLES (Hall & Oates song) --Private eyes, we're watching you, watching your every move... "D" Why a restaurant? 
MARC LEE Big freezers. 
Marc turns away, leaving them to wonder. 
CHRIS Let's keep eyes on it get pictures of anyone coming and going. 
Biggles watches Chris collapse onto his ruck-sack. (03.18.14) 68. 
BIGGLES Fucking Chief Nappy-nap.

Despite rolling blackouts, light is visible around plywood on Fahima Halal windows. 
CHRIS What do we got? 
MARC LEE 16 military aged males have gone in. 
CHRIS Sixteen? 
BIGGLES They serve more customers than McDonalds. 
MARC LEE And check this. 
ON DIGI-CAMERA, ZOOMS ON PHOTO of The Butcher entering-- CHRIS He still inside? 
MARC LEE I'm only clocking one point of entry. 
He's in there, but it's no easy breach. 
BIGGLES When they see it's The Legend they'll probably just invite him in-- (03.18.14) 69. 
CHRIS You got a problem? 
I didn't promote myself. 
BIGGLES No, I did it for you. 
You'd never have made Chief if I nicknamed you "The Myth". 
Chris snaps Biggles down, wrestles him into a choke. "D" Myth becomes Legend when we occupy a house, get 23 kills, and 21 are his. 
TONY Enough. 
It's everybody's Navy. 
Chris releases him. 
Biggles is coughing. 
BIGGLES --naw, it's Legend's Navy now. 
Just hope he leaves some for the rest of us. 
CHRIS Hash out tactics. 
We go at zero-dark. 
And Big Giggles is making the coffee. 
Biggles is flipping him off when the FATHER SPEAKS: TERP (translates) He invites you to join him for Eid al- Adha supper. 
He says -on this day everyone has a seat at my table-. 
Chris nods dubious gratitude, meeting the Father's eyes. 
CHRIS Tell him that's very generous of him. 
DINING ROOM - LATER A braised head of lamb eaten clean. 
TEAM 3 are chowing down, in good spirits, as Chris watches THE FATHER teach his SON to read. 
He is moved by their connection and acutely aware of what this war is costing him. 
That's when he sees-- (ECU) "SHOOTERS STRAWBERRIES" on father's elbows. 
They're red and calloused, like his own. 
Chris darkens, stands and slips down the hall-- BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER (03.18.14) 70. 
CHRIS searches the closet, ripping through clothes, pressing wall panels. 
He's crossing to the bed when-- FLOORBOARDS CREAK beneath the rug underfoot. 
He stands there, shifting his weight, floor creaking. 
DINING ROOM/HALLWAY BIGGLES is shoveling food in his mouth when a hand stops him. 
Chris signals, no more. 
FATHER'S eyes flick up as-- CHRIS RIPS THE FATHER out of his chair, dragging him down the hall by his hair. 
WIFE and KIDS screaming. "D" holds them off as-- Chris dumps the father at a STASH HOLE in the floor. 
Inside, a CACHE OF AKs, RPGs, IED components. 
CHRIS Tell him he's gonna be shipped off for detention and the Iraqi courts can decide what to do with him-- or he can help us get inside that restaurant down there. 
MARC LEE That's a bad move-- BIGGLES He's our breech. 
He's a fucking way in-- MARC LEE If something happens-- BIGGLES He's AQI man, look what he's holding. 
CHRIS It's his choice.

Chris fires and the GUARD'S HEAD explodes. 
FATHER dives for Guard's weapon, FIRING BACK at Chris when-- GUNFIRE FROM INSIDE shreds him. 
He folds forward, dead. 
TWO MEN in robes (TONY & BIGGLES) rush the door tossing grenades, pulling the father out as the GRENADES EXPLODE. CHRIS, MARC LEE and "D" push inside-- 94 INT. FAHIM HALAL - NIGHT 94 A smoky banquet hall.

CHRIS Pull back! Loading-- BIGGLES Got you. 
Biggles is slaying combatants. 
Precise and deadly. 
BIGGLES RPG! AN RPG burns down the alley, screaming between them and EXPLODES INTO SNIPER NEST. As dust clouds the night-- THE BUTCHER Slips through smoke, shooting his way to a getaway truck.

An angry crowd hoists the FATHER'S BODY in the air as a MESSIANIC TRIBAL LEADER riles them with chants. 
THE SON stands up-front, small hands fisted, glaring at CHRIS. CHRIS (can't take eyes off son) I offered his father detention. 
I gave him a choice-- MASTER CHIEF MARTIN He picked the wrong fucking side. 
That's all there is to it. 
Fog of war. 
THE CROWD growing in tension and number. 
PFC ALVAREZ Sir, we have armed insurgents moving this way. 
We need to make tracks. 
MASTER CHIEF MARTIN (hops in Bradley) Helluva an effort here, Chief. 
You keep after this bastard. 
We'll get him. 
As they roar off, Chris pulls Terp over to the TRIBAL LEADER whose SHOCKING GREEN EYES reflect firelight. 
CHRIS KYLE Tell him this boy's father was fighting for the people that butchered the clerics we found in the freezer in there.

A dark shape sprints toward them. 
One man kneels, the other braces him. 
The reflective swoosh catches light as-- Mustafa runs up the man's back, leaping onto the wall. 
CHRIS/TRIBAL LEADER Tribal Leader rages, crowd at his back, eyes on fire-- TERP -I am the seventh son of Isaac of Abraham. 
This is the land of my father, and I am not afraid.- He says your evil is greater than those you fight. 
He calls you white satan, devil of Ramadi. 
Venom peels across Chris' face and makes it appear true.

MADS/YOUNG VETERAN Great, sir. 
I'm grateful to be alive. 
It hasn't been easy but-- He lifts his pant-leg and shows an ARTIFICIAL LEG. MADS It cost lots of guys more than a leg. 
CHRIS Did you lose some friends? 
MADS That too, but I'm talking about guys that lived. 
They made it back but they're just not back. 
They can't seem to get right.

Even when you're here you're not here. 
Taya pulls McKenna off her breast. 
Chris scoops her up. 
TAYA I hate the teams for it.

BIGGLES So much for leading us to the Butcher. 
CHRIS So much for him having my horseshoe. (03.18.14) 85. 
Chris pulls his mask down. 
He has a beard and the sturm und drang of war are writ loud on his face. 
DISTANT BALUSTRADE MUSTAFA lays prone, mumbles a prayer and takes two deep breaths before putting his eye to the scope. 
MUSTAFA SCOPE POV CROSS-HAIRS TACK to fluttering sheets, the wind revealed in their billow. 
TWO FIGURES are cloaked there, indistinguishable heads peaking over laundry lines. 
He aims left-and-above the head closest to him. 
ON THE ROOF Chris and Biggles stand among the billowing sheets. 
CHRIS She'll take it to Zales and try to find out how much your spent. 
BIGGLES She's not like that. 
CHRIS They're all like that. 
BIGGLES It's giant, bro. 
Four karats. 
It had to belong to one of Saddam's bitches-- Chris is laughing when he sees a FLASH OF GLASS in the distance. 
Before he can utter a warning-- A GUNSHOT SOUNDS The bullet flays the muzzle of Biggles M4. Shrapnel enters his face. 
Biggles goes down in a red mist-- CHRIS No!-- The right side of his face is a pulpy cavity. 
His eye socket obliterated. 
He appears mortally wounded. 
CHRIS (dives on him, keys mike) Biggles is down. 
Man down. (pulls Biggles close, chiseled with grief) No, buddy. 
No! Stay with me-- (03.18.14) 86. 
He drags him one way, then another. 
He can't see past the blood-spackled sheets. 
A SHOT pocks the roof at his feet. 
CHRIS (keys mike) Cover! I need cover. 
He's picking us off. 
ANOTHER SHOT inches from his head. 
They are being hunted. 
BIGGLES (gargled) I'm got it. 
I got it-- I can walk-- Biggles pulls himself up, tilting his head forward to not choke on his own blood. 
With heroic effort, he stumbles to the stairs. 
Chris, stunned he's alive, ducks an arm-- 107 EXT. STREET 107 TWO MARINE UNITS provide cover as the Humvee speeds off. 108 INT. HUMMER 108 MARC LEE drives.

I shouldn't have had us up there-- BIGGLES Am I gonna die? 
Chris looks to Dauber-- DAUBER We'll rub a little dirt in it, get you a sip of water, you'll be fine. 
Dauber shakes his head, he's not going to make it. 
BIGGLES --it was always gonna be me-- CHRIS Coulda been any of us. 
Just hang on-- (03.18.14) 87.

CHRIS He was 1000 meters out. 
Only one enemy sniper makes that shot. 
A jeep pulls up. 
COLONEL JONES and MASTER CHIEF MARTIN step out. 
COL. JONES Will he make it? 
Chris turns away, choked up. 
DAUBER Doesn't look good, Master Chief. 
MASTER CHIEF MARTIN That's the first SEAL hit, sir. "D" Fuck! The sun high. 
COL. JONES A Shi'a cab driver we source is saying there's a stronghold seven doors down. 
MASTER CHIEF MARTIN Marine units that covered your exfil are still engaged there. (03.18.14) 88.

TWO BRADLEY TRANSPORT vehicles follow. 
A CAR pulls into the road ahead. 
INSURGENT PASSENGER leans out, FIRING AN RPG. It explodes across the tank but does no damage. 
Tank still coming, Insurgents pull away-- But the tank catches them. 
Treads climbing the back of the car, overtaking it. 
INSURGENTS are trying to get out, screaming, as steel folds around them and flattens them. 
And the ABRAMS vaults off the other side-- 112 INT. BRADLEY TRANSPORT VEHICLE 112 THE PUNISHERS. Ears pinned back.

DAUBER and TONY are pinned between windows. 
MARC LEE steps to the nearest window to lay suppressive fire. 
MARC LEE Contact-- GUNFIRE STRAFES IN AT AN ANGLE, HITTING MARC LEE IN HIS OPEN MOUTH. HE'S BLOWN BACKWARDS, HITTING THE WALL AND-- MARC LEE is down. 
Blood pooling. 
A forever stare. 
CHRIS Marc-- CHRIS is staggered but his training takes over and he steps into the same window, BLASTING FIRE. DAUBER is trying to intubate Marc but the back of his head is gone. 
He was dead before he hit the wall.

MARC'S LEE MOM "My question is when does glory fade away and become a wrongful crusade?" CHRIS HEARS MARC'S VOICE: MARC LEE (VO) "When does it become an unjustified means by which one is completely consumed." COLTON reaches for his father's hand. 
Chris jumps, startled. 
He looks at Colton, then Taya. 
He's caught with his guard down and it appears he may let them in... 
But he quickly returns his gaze to the flagged casket. 
CLOSE ON CASKET NAVY SEALS bang their Tridents into the coffin.

THE KIDS chatter in back. 
CHRIS drives, in a fugue-state when he spots-- A BROWN VAN, four cars back, same as the one in Ramadi. 
TAYA Marc wrote that letter two weeks ago. 
Did he say any of that to you? 
VAN ROARS up the turning lane. 
It's pulling alongside them. 
Chris grips the wheel, ready-- the van roars past TAYA Chris? 
I want to know what you thought of his letter... 
CHRIS (slow, absent) An AQI informant called in a tip. 
Biggles had just been shot. 
We were operating off emotion and-- we walked into an ambush. 
The kids grow quiet. 
The air sucked from the car. 
CHRIS But that's not what killed him. 
That letter did. 
That letter killed Marc. (looks to her) He let go and he paid the price for it. (03.18.14) 92. 
Taya turns away, wrecked. 
They drive in silence. 116 INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 116 TV lights the dark room. 
NEWS GRAPHIC: "Americans killed in Iraq: 3932". 
CHRIS and TAYA talk to the ceiling. 
CHRIS If something ever happened to me-- you'd meet someone else. 
You'd be alright. 
His detachment is unearthly. 
TAYA Do you want to die? 
Is that what it is? 
CHRIS No. TAYA (cheeks shine with tears) Then tell me why do you do it. 
I want to understand. 
CHRIS I do it for you. 
To protect you. 
TAYA No you don't. 
I'm here. 
Your family is here. 
Your children have no father-- CHRIS Without this, there's nothing. 
TAYA Bullshit. 
It's not about us anymore. 
You don't know when to quit. 
It's over- (violent) You did your part! We sacrificed enough. 
Let somebody else go-- CHRIS I could never live with myself. 
TAYA You find a way! You have to. 
I need you to be human again. 
I need you here. (no response, she calms) If you leave again, we might not be here when you get back. 
It startles him and he seems suddenly alert to her suffering. 
He reaches for her, holding her to his chest. (03.18.14) 93. 
CHRIS I know. 
Her eyes sink into a well of ruin. 116A OMITTED 116A 117 INT. NAVY HOSPITAL, SAN DIEGO - DAY 117 A DUST MOTH flutters around the wall sconce.

Part of his head caved-in and badly marred, one eyelid open on a milky-white eyeball. 
BIGGLES Chris? 
Where are you? 
CHRIS I'm right here just give me a minute-- (hobbles around the bed) Just blind as a bat, huh? 
BIGGLES Yeah... 
It fucking blows. 
They're gonna fix my face though. 
CHRIS That's good. 
Your face always needed a little fixing. 
Chris sounds upbeat but his eyes betray him. 
CHRIS I heard you proposed? 
Did you tell Kelly the diamond was from Zales? 
BIGGLES Naw, I bought a new one. 
A small one. 
Her dad helped me out. 
CHRIS Nice. 
BIGGLES She wouldn't leave me, bro. 
I told her to go-- but she wouldn't leave. (MORE) (03.18.14) 94. 
BIGGLES (CONT'D) (voice cracking) She's getting a raw fucking deal. 
CHRIS No she's not. 
How can you say that? 
She's getting you. (eyes welling up) All four inches. 
Biggles laughs and tears roll from his vacant eye. 
BIGGLES I'm glad this happened to me and not you. 
No way you could've handled it. 
CHRIS You're probably right. 
There is a pause. 
BIGGLES They say you're the deadliest sniper in U.S. 
Military history. 
CHRIS Is that what they say? 
Biggles grows quiet. 
CHRIS The bad guys fled up into to Sadr City. 
BIGGLES You're not going back? 
CHRIS We're gonna wall `em in and hunt `em down. 
BIGGLES You don't have to do this. 
CHRIS Yes I do.

Across from him-- MARINE LT. The Legend, right? 
I heard you killed 101 men your last tour. 
The hajis call you The Devil of Ramadi. 
Chris removes his wedding band, hangs it from his necklace. 
MARINE LT. So how many kills you got now?

CHRIS Hold there! We are 30 seconds out-- (pointing ahead) Go. Straight ahead. 
Go-- They run for their lives. 
Unable to see two feet ahead. 
Sand shredding their skin. 
Chris is struggling-- Squad passing him. 
Knees failing him. 
He can't keep up. 
INT. STRYKER THE GUNNER stares at REMOTE WEAPONS SCREEN when SIX FIGURES EMERGE from the dust. 
He's about to fire-- GUNNER BDUs-- That's them! Drop the ramp. 
The ramp drops. 
STORM HOWLING. RANGER-ONE dives in, MARINES follow, then "D" rolls in. 
The rig pulls off. (03.18.14) 108. "D" Where's Chris? 
He was just-- IN THE STREET Chris falters forward. 
Insurgents pursuing. 
The Stryker just visible ahead-- pulling away. 
IN THE STRYKER M2 GUNNER can't see shit on his monitor. "D" --stop the rig, man! Stop-- DRIVER I don't see him-- IN THE STREET Chris is ten feet behind the rig, sprinting. 
Bullets sing past. 
He sheds flack-jacket and webbing, Bible and flag. 
He drops his gun in the dirt and dives. 
His hand clutches the last rung of slat-armor and-- Chris Kyle is dragged off the battlefield. 
IN THE STREET Sand buries the METALLIC TOY SOLDIER that followed him since childhood. 
Wind whips pages of the Bible and pulls at the flag until it flaps unfolded. 
WE'RE BLOWN AWAY with it, twisting and clapping into an otherworldy beige. 
IN THE STORM We catch glimpses of the city below: graffiti'd T-walls, a cracked expanse of desert floor and the lanky body of an enemy sniper splayed across a rooftop. 
Wind rips the Hefty bag away and sand pocks the DEAD FACE OF MUSTAFA-- before we're swept up into the howling rage. 
LONG FADE: 137 OMITTED 137 138 OMITTED 138 139 OMITTED 139 (03.18.14) 109. 140 OMITTED 140 140A INT. AIRPORT BAR - NIGHT 140A CHRIS sits hunched at the bar, his eyes track patrons and staff (ECU) their hands, torsos, eyes. 
HIS PHONE RINGS. CHRIS (into phone) --hello? 
TAYA (OS) Where are you? 
I got a weird message that you were on a plane? 
He can HEAR THE KIDS in the background. 
CHRIS (into phone) Yeah, I got out early. 
TAYA (OS) So are you in Germany, or-- CHRIS I'm here, I'm stateside. 
TAYA (OS) You're home? 
What are you doing? 
CHRIS (looks around for answer) I guess I just needed a minute. 
TAYA (OS) Chris, the kids are dying to see you. 
It's been nine months. 
CHRIS Yeah, I know... 
Me too. 
I'm coming. 
TAYA (OS) (pause) Are you alright? 
CHRIS Yeah. 
I'm good. 
TAYA (OS) Then come home. 
We miss you. 
He nods silently, listens to his kids. (03.18.14) 110. 
CHRIS Okay. 141 OMITTED 141 141A INT. KYLE HOME 141A CLOSE ON- the back of Chris' head. 
He watches a WAR MOVIE on TV. As CAMERA CIRCLES the room, we glimpse THE MOVIE; an injured soldier calls for help amid shocking gunfire. 
TRACKING BEHIND THE TV, we see Chris' wrought face and a household bustling around him. 
COLTON carries party plates outside, MCKENNA fights to get cowboy boots on and- TAYA CALLS to him from the kitchen but we can't hear her until the CAMERA TRACKS to HER POV-- the gunfire is gone, the TV IS OFF. That war movie is playing in his head. 
TAYA Chris...? 
He finally looks up, slick with sweat, affecting calm. 142 EXT. BACKYARD - DAY 142 Streamers twist against gunmetal sky. 
COLTON and MCKENNA set up birthday decorations. 
The family dog, A PYRENEES SHEEPDOG, bounds about. 
TAYA AND CHRIS, on back steps. 
TAYA --his game is Saturdays. 
He's the tallest kid on the team. 
The doctor said he could be six-four. 
I can't wait for you to see him play. 
Maybe you could even coach? 
Chris looks past his kids, looking a thousand yards out. 
TAYA McKenna's about to lose that tooth and I'm worried she's going to swallow it. 
She said she'd let you pull it. 
But only you. 
His head falls. 
When he looks up-- COLTON'S BIRTHDAY PARTY UNDERWAY 6 YEAR OLDS and PARENTS mill around but all WE HEAR-- (03.18.14) 111. 
TAYA (VO) (CONT'D) I wish you'd talk to me, Chris. 
COLTON AND TWO FRIENDS chase each other around the yard. 
TAYA (VO) (CONT'D) I just feel this dark space between us and I don't know how to reach you. 
THE SHEEPDOG jumps on the back of COLTON'S FRIEND. The boy goes down hard, gets up crying, running from the dog. 
The Sheepdog does it again. 
THE BOY FALLS AND HIS CRYING is cuts into scene. 
THE BOY'S MOM runs over. 
His back clawed up. 
BOY'S MOM Get him off! Get away-- Chris rips the dog off by its collar. 
The dog snaps at him and in an instant he whips out his .45 to shoot it. 
TAYA (OC) No! He's a puppy. 
He doesn't know! Chris looks up, bent with animus, and he's looking at the face of his children, their friends, and their parents-- They look at him, terrified. 
He releases the dog. 
Lost. 143 OMITTED 143 144 OMITTED 144 145 OMITTED 145 146 OMITTED 146 147 OMITTED 147 148 INT. VETERAN'S HOSPITAL - DAY 148 Harsh light. 
Water-stained walls. 
CHRIS looks beaten, afraid and dubious of this BUTTONED-DOWN DOCTOR. (03.18.14) 112. 
DOCTOR Maybe you saw things, or did some things over there that you wish you hadn't-- CHRIS That's not me. 
DOCTOR What's not you? 
CHRIS I was just protecting my guys. 
They were trying to kill our soldiers and-- I'm willing to stand before my creator and answer for every shot I took. (struggles) The thing that haunts me are all the guys I couldn't save. 
NAVY DOCTOR You want to save more guys, walk down any hall in this hospital. 
We got plenty soldiers that need saving. (pulls prescription pad) I'm going to recommend Zoloft and-- 149 OMITTED 149 150 EXT./INT. REC ROOM 150 CHRIS steps to a window looking in on TEN YOUNG VETERANS sitting around a TV; wounded, edgy, in need. 
A legless Marine with a jelly-roll face looks up; this is "WYNN". 151 EXT. SHOOTING RANGE, UNIDENTIFIABLE LOCALE - DAY 151 CHRIS kneels before WYNN (wheelchair) who's armed with a .300 resting on Chris' shoulder. 
Wynn takes aim, FIRES-- CHRIS How's it feel? 
WYNN Feels like The Legend is trying to fuck up my shot. 
Stay still, man. 
Gun on shoulder, Chris is calm, he's found peace. 
BAM! WYNN Bulls-eye, boy! Damn, if that don't feel like I got my balls back. (03.18.14) 113. 
Chris dusts himself off. 
There's healing here. 
WYNN Why you spend all this time with us? 
I know you got a family. 
CHRIS I heard you had a nice boot collection before the war and-- WYNN (laughs) Seriously man. 
Why do you do it. 
CHRIS We gotta take care of our own. 
Chris squints into the falling sun and time passes with-- LONG FADE: 151A EXT. ROADWAY 151A The black F350 roars past a "Welcome to Texas" sign on the interstate. 152 OMITTED 152 153 EXT. KYLE HOME - MIDLOTHIAN, TEXAS - DAY 153 A residential neighborhood. 
Texas flags wave from stoops. 
CHRIS and COLTON carry boxes inside. "MAX THE SHEEPDOG" bounds along with them and never leaves Chris' side. 
BEDROOM Chris enters to find Taya has placed his old COWBOY BOOTS at the foot of the bed. 
He takes a seat and looks down at the combat boots on his feet. 
He bends to unlace them-- 153A EXT. PASTURE, TEXAS - DAY 153A A pale Stallion gallops through prairie grass. 
Chris and McKenna admire it from a rustic fence. 
Her pink cowboys boots kick Texas dust onto his old boots. (03.18.14) 114. 153B INT. BATHROOM, KYLE HOME - DAY 153B Chris is showering when Taya sneaks in and flushes the toilet. 
He howls at the scalding water and she's laughing, rushing for the door when-- he lunges out and grabs her, pulling her in with all her clothes on. 154 OMITTED 154 155 OMITTED 155 156 EXT. FIELD - DAWN 156 Under a watercolor dawn, CHRIS leads COLTON across a prairie, hunting rifle on shoulder, teaching as they go. 
THE SCORE BUILDS and follows them into morning. 157 INT. KYLE HOUSE - DAY 157 Dust motes drift across blades of light falling through blinds onto CHRIS. He wears the BELT BUCKLE he won long ago, pleated Levis, and twirls an antique six-shooter. 
CHRIS Get `em up, lil' lady. 
Hands in the air. 
TAYA is at the window gazing at their kids in the yard. 
TAYA Can I tell you something. 
CHRIS Tell it to the judge. 
TAYA I'm proud of you and I don't say it enough. 
I feel blessed. 
You're an incredible father and-- I feel lucky to have my husband back. 
CHRIS We could lock the doors. 
They can't get out of the yard. 
TAYA I know how hard you fought to get here. (03.18.14) 115. 
CHRIS You're worth fighting for. 
She crosses to him, running a hand up his leg. 
TAYA Did you pleat those jeans? 
CHRIS Yes, ma'am. 
Right up the middle. 
TAYA Well, you're just a regular old cowboy again, aren't you? 
He kisses her, lifting her-- CHRIS I meant what I said about locking the doors. 
TAYA Aren't you and Chad going to the range? 
CHRIS (checks watch) Not for four minutes. 
TAYA Is that all it takes. 
CHRIS It'll take half that. 
Then I got two minutes leftover just to look at you. 
He sways with her, dancing a little two-step. 
TAYA Who are you taking out? 
CHRIS This Marine. 
His mom does parking at school and she asked for my help. 
TAYA Well don't be late for dinner. 
COLTON and McKENNA race in, hugging on their dad. 
COLTON Dad, you want to play Skylander? 
Please-- (03.18.14) 116. 
CHRIS I gotta go do something but when I get back, okay? 
But you have to let me win. 
COLTON No way. 
MCKENNA Poke the bear-- McKENNA pokes Chris and he BARKS like a dog. 
MCKENNA No. You're supposed to roar. 
Like Grrr. 
She pokes him again and Chris emits a RUMBLING ROAR. She giggles and hugs him so he'll save her. 
CHRIS I should get going... 
He kisses his daughter and tosses his son's hair. 
CHRIS Look after our women, Bubba. (turns to Taya) Love you, babe. 
TAYA Love you too. 
Chris kisses Taya and lingers, worshiping her. 
Dust motes drift past and he appears immortal in the bladed light. 
Then-- He walks out the door for the last time. 
The house grows quiet. 
Colton plays video games. 
McKenna colors. 
The dog lays by the door. 
And Taya stands in the golden light. 
FADE TO BLACK: CARD(1): "On February 2, 2013, Chris Kyle was killed by a former Marine he was trying to help. 
He died as he lived... looking after one of his own." OUT OF BLACK: 157A EXT. TEXAS HIGHWAY 157A Rain falls to Randy Travis singing Amazing Grace. (03.18.14) 117. 
ACTUAL FOOTAGE: A funeral procession appears over a distant ridge. 
Police escorts lead a white hearse and 300 vehicles down a highway lined with people waving flags. 
The last car finally passes. 
An UNKNOWN CIVILIAN stands alone in a muddy field saluting a fallen hero. 
THE END
A MOST VIOLENT YEAR Written by J.C. 
Chandor This film is set in New York City, 1981: Murders: 2,228 Forcible Rape: 5,405 Violent Crime: 180,235 Aggravated Assault: 60,329 Property: 1,029,749 Vehicle Theft: 133,041 Robbery: 112,273 Burglary: 360,925 Larceny-Theft: 535,783 Crime Index: 1,209,984 1981 was the most violent year in NYC history as recorded by overall Crime Index in relation to population. 2 JANUARY 31, 1981 Over black we hear the opening of a garage door. 
The light spills in and we see. 
EXT. UPPER MIDDLE CLASS RESIDENTIAL HOUSE, QUEENS NYC - SUNRISE Open on ABEL MORALES. It is early morning and still almost dark out. 
He has a rugged yet prosperously-handsome face and is in his mid-thirties. 
He is struggling to get started with his morning jog. 
EXT. SHIP GRAVEYARD, STATEN ISLAND NYC - DAY It is early morning. 
A large bulk fuel oil transport truck sits idling next to a decrepit old dock. 
The dock sticks into a backwater section of New York harbor that is filled with the decaying remains of half-sunken abandoned barges and tug boats. 
JULIAN, the young driver of the truck sits and nervously scans the horizon. 
Eventually a large fuel barge appears in the distance being pushed by a tug boat. 
The barge is steered past the skeletons of the other sunken ships and makes its way to the dock in front of the tanker truck. 
JULIAN gets out of his truck and readies a large connecting hose. 
He looks around nervously. 
JULIAN steps across the broken boards of the dock and struggles to get the hose to the barge. 
He hands it to the BARGE OPERATOR with a nod of the head and no words. 
They connect the hose and start a large generator as it begins to pump fuel into the truck. 
They both scan the horizon again as the sun begins to come up. 
EXT. MORE INDUSTRIAL QUEENS NEIGHBORHOOD- SAME TIME ABEL is still jogging as the light begins to increase. 
It is freezing out. 
He is a very serious guy. 
He is not happy that he is out of shape. 
Finally he stops and bends over to catch his breath. 
We have run with him from the nicer part of the neighborhood to a rougher section. 
As he catches his breath he stands up and looks around. 
He is unsure of his feelings. 3 INT. ANNA'S DRESSING AREA The camera slowly moves in as ANNA sits in a slip at her make up table putting on her face for the day ahead. 
She looks into the mirror as if she is putting on a coat of armor. 
INT. DRIVER'S CAB OF A BULK OIL TRANSPORT TRUCK - DAY STANDARD HEATING OIL, "We set the Standard" is written in logo form on the side of the tank. 
The truck idles in traffic waiting to pay the toll to cross the Verrazano bridge that spans the mouth of New York harbor. 
JULIAN, the young driver from the dock, cautiously looks around as the traffic inches along. 
He finally approaches the toll booth and pays. 
JULIAN Good morning. 
JULIAN speaks English with a well-sanded accent. 
Is it Central American or Mexican? 
The female collector gives him a smile. 
He heads through the booth, but there is still traffic on the other side as the lanes merge together. 
Just as the traffic is about to pick up he looks in his rearview mirror and we see TWO GUYS come walking through the traffic and towards the cab. 
Before we know it they are climbing up the cab steps. 
The GUY on the driver's side, LOUIS SERVIDIO, is small and very slight but he moves with great speed and strength. 
He shatters the glass side window with his elbow. 
Unlocks the door just as his partner, THUG #2, does the same thing on the passenger side, but he is holding a gun. 
They are not wearing masks. 
It's very brazen. 
Before THUG #2 even asks JULIAN to get out of the cab LOUIS SERVIDIO crushes him in the jaw with three swift punches then pulls him out of the cab and down onto the roadway. 
LOUIS SERVIDIO pulls the door shut and they drive away with the truck leaving JULIAN sitting in the middle of the road staring, as blood starts to flow from his jaw. 
INT. PARKING YARD OF STANDARD HEATING OIL- SAME TIME Two almost-matching late model Mercedes pull up to a chain- link gate with a small sign that says "STANDARD HEATING OIL: WE SET THE STANDARD". The DISPATCHER opens the gate. 4 They both pull into reserved parking spaces next to each other. 
ABEL is dressed in a very tasteful custom made suit. 
ABEL's wife ANNA was driving the car behind him. 
She is a beautiful, tall, blonde woman dressed to the nines but with a streak in her eye that this is all business. 
You would not want to cross this woman. 
ABEL Ready? 
ANNA Yes. 
ABEL You look very nice. 
ANNA Thank you. 
ABEL You sure? 
ANNA Yes. 
ABEL walks around and opens his trunk. 
He takes out two large empty briefcases. 
He carries the briefcases as they both walk over to a large, unmarked, armored van that is idling in the middle of the parking lot. 
Two ARMED GUARDS get out of the van. 
One is holding a clipboard. 
He walks up to ANNA and ABEL. He hands them the clipboard. 
They look at each other one last time and then both sign the document. 
The other GUARD opens up the back of the truck. 
ABEL hands him the briefcases and the guard begins to fill them with cash. 
Lots of cash. 
ABEL and ANNA stand at the open back of the van and just watch. 
Finally he finishes and hands the now- heavy cases to ABEL. ABEL picks up the two cases and walks a bit away from the truck. 
He turns to ANNA. ANNA (CONT'D) Don't do anything stupid. 
ABEL We don't have any more money so what else could I do. 
She gives a small smile. 
He looks at his watch. 
They kiss. 5 ABEL turns and begins walking with the cases. 
He gives a nod to the DISPATCHER, who we now see, is in a small gatehouse, and he begins to open the front gate. 
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE THE FRONT GATE- SAME TIME ABEL walks out through the gate and down the abandoned industrial street about 25 yards, then looks to his right. 
He looks down at the cases in his hands, turns, and stands looking into the neighboring site. 
EXT. MASSIVE OIL TANK FARM: BROOKLYN NY WATERFRONT - DAY ABEL comes walking across the parking lot and sees ANDREW WALSH standing in the middle of the dusty parking lot. 
ANDREW is their longtime LAWYER/RIGHT-HAND MAN and is in his mid fifties. 
He is smart but tired. 
The oversized briefcase in his left hand seems to have permanently tilted his posture that direction. 
The large oil-holding tanks loom above them. 
The place is rusting and could use some work. 
As they wait, the setting has the look and choreography of an illegal transaction about to go down. 
ANDREW WALSH So how are we this morning? 
ABEL (gives a smile and nod) ANDREW WALSH Well I woke up feeling very good about this. 
ABEL Really? 
They both take a look at their watches. 
ABEL (CONT'D) You've been telling me not to do this for a year. 
ANDREW WALSH Well we are going all in... so now I love it. 
Gives him another slight smile. 
They stand around in awkward silence. 
Finally a late-model Ford Ltd. station wagon pulls into the lot. 6 ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D) Here we go. 
And a group of FIVE HASIDIC JEWS gets out. 
There are two guys in their twenties, two in their fifties, and one in his mid- to-late seventies. 
They all shake each other's hands then stand around for a beat. 
ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D) Should we head inside? 
INT. SMALL TEMPORARY OFFICE TRAILER - DAY The group is now jammed around a folding table inside the trailer. 
ABEL and his lawyer sit at one end facing the rest of them. 
Finally, the senior member of the group, JOSEPH MENDELSOHN, eyes up ABEL and leans forward. 
His accent is strong yet you can understand every word. 
JOSEPH So why is it you want this land? 
ABEL I'm sorry? 
JOSEPH It has been difficult for you to get me here, no? 
Over a year? 
ABEL Almost two. 
JOSEPH There are many like it around? 
And thanks to all these tests you paid for, we now know it is as much of a mess below the ground as it is above. 
My people have looked at your books, I know this is a lot of money for you, so why have you kept on us so... just for this ugly and polluted little piece of the earth. 
ABEL I have been looking over my fence at this property for a very long time. 
JOSEPH So it is just proximity? 7 ABEL No... 
I imagine I want it for the same reason you did. 
JOSEPH And what's that? 
ABEL To grow. 
JOSEPH Well, I am in the garment business so I appreciate that sentiment. 
But I inherited this land from my uncle. 
Sadly he had no children of his own. 
He was the one that let them build these tanks here. 
So this place can do little for me... in fact thanks to all those tests you've done it may be a liability. 
As you know I offered to lease the site to you at a fair price, but you were not interested? 
ABEL No. JOSEPH Why not? 
ABEL I like to own the things I use. 
JOSEPH I can see that. 
Long pause. 
ABEL So. JOSEPH Yes. 
This contract here, your lawyers have fully reviewed it? 
ANDREW WALSH Of course. 
JOSEPH And you have brought the money? (ABEL nodes yes) So you realize you have only thirty days to close this transaction? (MORE) 8 JOSEPH (CONT'D) No extensions, no... contingencies whatsoever. 
ABEL I understand. 
JOSEPH I want you to know this up front. 
I am a very fair man but I believe in honoring contracts. 
You will fulfill your end of this contract and the property is yours. 
If you can't we will keep your money and will sell it to your competitor who has been chasing us almost as badly as you have. 
I like you, but know that the only reason I am choosing you is because of the favorable terms of this contract. 
So this is business... and when you sign this.... 
ABEL I understand. 
JOSEPH Well then, let's see this money, and then I will sign these papers. 
ABEL turns to ANDREW and gives a slight nod. 
ANDREW pulls the black briefcase onto the table and opens it. 
It has seven hundred thousand dollars in cash in it. 
He slides it over to their side. 
The old man signs the contract and they shake hands. 
EXT. MASSIVE OIL TANK FARM PARKING LOT - DAY ABEL stands next to ANDREW's car. 
ANDREW WALSH Congratulations. 
ABEL It's not ours yet. 
ANDREW WALSH Well, it was a hell of a job just getting them to this point. 
It's a good day for us. 
Take a walk around. 
Enjoy it for a second. 
ANDREW gets in his car and drives away. 
ABEL looks around and decides to go for a little walk. 9 He heads out towards the tanks and walks among them. 
They tower seven stories above him. 
As he walks, he is cut off like a maze from any other visual input. (Similar to being inside a Richard Serra sculpture) Finally he emerges into some light and as ABEL looks up the camera reveals his view. 
It's midtown Manhattan in all its glory, just across the East River from the site. 
He stares at the city and we see the true depths of his ambition lock on his face. 
He looks to his watch. 
INT. 1981 MERCEDES 500 SEC ABEL drives away from New York City. 
We see it behind his head. 
INT. CAR ON MERRITT PARKWAY The terrain turns to upscale country. 
EXT. COUNTRY HOUSE - DAY ABEL's car drives into a long driveway through the woods. 
Then an architect-designed, 80's modern house, still under construction, appears. 
He pulls up in front. 
He gets out of the car and stands there looking at the large house. 
He walks into the house and we see more clearly that it is nearing completion. 
It is empty. 
INT. 80'S MODERN HOUSE - DAY ABEL walks over to the massive floor-to-ceiling windows and stands looking over the large pond that sits down the hill from the house. 
As he stares out his CONTRACTOR comes quietly walking in behind him. 
CONTRACTOR Hello? 
ABEL There he is. 
He walks up behind him and they both look out in silence for a beat. 
ABEL (CONT'D) You have done a beautiful job here. 
CONTRACTOR Thank you. 10 ABEL I mean it. 
You and your men should be very proud. 
CONTRACTOR We are. 
ABEL Most people don't have anything beautiful like this to show for their day's work. 
You are a lucky man. 
CONTRACTOR I am. 
ABEL Well I thank you... my family will be very happy here. 
CONTRACTOR I hope so. 
ABEL Now I think I owe you some money. 
CONTRACTOR That may be true. 
ABEL It is. 
ABEL reaches into his jacket pocket and takes out a thick envelope of cash. 
As he does we see a transformation of his personality from pleasant philosopher to a direct voice of unquestioned authority. 
ABEL (CONT'D) This is the seventeen outstanding. 
But we are arriving here in four days. 
It must be done. 
CONTRACTOR Yes. 
ABEL Well, I'll let you go. 
He says this as he leads him to the door. 
ABEL (CONT'D) And the tile in the master bath... 11 CONTRACTOR It's being replaced, as I mentioned to your wife, that was an error on our part. 
Congratulations on your home. 
ABEL Thank you. 
EXT. TOP OF HILL ON OTHER SIDE OF POND LOOKING BACK AT HIS HOUSE. - DAY ABEL stands, surrounded by massive trees in the thick forest, looking across the ridge back at his house. 
He is a little out of breath after climbing the hill but he looks strangely comfortable even though he is standing in the woods in a suit, tie, and dress shoes. 
He takes a nice cigar out of his pocket, lights it and has a real moment of joy. 
He looks up to the tops of the trees, then back at the new house. 
He exhales a long deep breath. 
Then we hear a large truck come rumbling in the driveway. 
He hears it. 
His face shows that he knows the sound immediately. 
EXT. HOUSE DRIVEWAY - DAY ABEL comes out of the woods and sees a smaller heating oil delivery truck (with the same Standard Heating Oil logo) parked in the driveway. 
His face shows it probably isn't great news. 
INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY ABEL comes down a hallway and then turns through a curtain into a treatment area. 
Sitting on the table is the young driver of the truck, JULIAN. He has a contraption on his head that is holding his jaw shut in place. 
His eye is black. 
ABEL goes over and gives him a tight hug. 
But then he ever so slightly checks himself and places him back down on the table. 
ABEL looks up and sees ANNA, standing in the corner. 
She is all business. 
They stare at each other. 
ANNA They broke his jaw. 
ABEL Have they found the truck? 12 ANNA Yes. 
ABEL Are you alright? 
JULIAN (NODS YES) ABEL Have the police been here yet? 
ANNA He was left in the middle of the highway without a truck, they brought him in. 
ABEL Can you speak? 
ANNA'S temper is rising. 
ANNA Not for a couple days... 
Can I speak with you outside? 
ANNA heads out into the hallway. 
ABEL looks around a beat then follows. 
EXT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY -SAME TIME ANNA is waiting in the hallway. 
ANNA Did they sign the contract? 
ABEL Yes. 
ANNA And took the deposit? 
ABEL Yes. 
ANNA So it's a go? 
ABEL (he gives a nice nod yes) ANNA Congratulations. 13 ABEL To you as well. 
ANNA We have thirty days? 
He nods ever so slightly yes, and she gives him a knowing smile back of equal measure. 
We are beginning to see that they actually work quite well together. 
ABEL These fucking guys. 
This poor kid has been working his ass off. 
ANNA Do you want me to speak to my Brother about this? 
ABEL No...don't talk to him or your father. 
ANNA This can't continue. 
ABEL It won't. 
ANNA It will if we don't do something. 
ABEL I'm meeting with the D.A. in the morning. 
ANNA Oh, fuck the D.A. 
He's more interested in coming after us than helping us. 
ABEL looks around in disapproval. 
She thinks this through and then looks in at JULIAN. ANNA (CONT'D) It's not fair to them. 
You're at war here. 
ABEL No we are not. 
ANNA Really... because they are. 14 ABEL Well I'm not. 
They look each other over. 
She then finally leans in and gives him a caring kiss, she walks off. 
ANNA And you're going out to check on the new house? 
ABEL Yes. 
He watches her walk away then looks back into the hospital room. 
He enters. 
INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY ABEL walks into the room and looks at JULIAN. He looks up and ABEL has trouble putting it to words. 
ABEL I have to get going. 
JULIAN gives a nod. 
ABEL (CONT'D) Can we get you anything? 
Nods no. 
ABEL (CONT'D) We'll pick you up when they let you out of here. 
They look at each other. 
ABEL (CONT'D) These men are cowards. 
Too weak to make a living... or even fight with their own hands, and too stupid to think up anything else to do. 
Finally he turns and leaves. 
EXT. ABANDONED RACETRACK PARKING LOT - QUEENS NY - DAY ABEL drives up to the drop off scene. 
There is the large bulk transport truck and one lone police car just sitting in the middle of the parking lot. 15 ABEL gets out, walks up, and stops to stare at the truck. 
A young beat cop is sitting on the hood of his car waiting. 
ABEL May I take it? 
BEAT COP Excuse me? 
ABEL May I take it now? 
BEAT COP Is it yours? 
ABEL Yes. 
BEAT COP Well, I'm sorry about that. 
Once the owner or an owner's representative files the claim form in Corona she's yours... again. 
ABEL So you guys have done what you needed to? 
BEAT COP Yes. 
ABEL And what was that? 
BEAT COP I'm sorry? 
ABEL You just said you've done what you needed to... so what was it that you've done? 
BEAT COP (looks back dumbfounded) ABEL Did you fingerprint or anything? 
BEAT COP No need, these guys always wear gloves. 
ABEL So you've done nothing. 16 BEAT COP I'm not exactly sure, I just got here at four. 
My shift is actually up. 
ABEL So who's coming? 
They stare at each other, then the truck. 
ABEL then climbs up and we see he knows his way around the truck. 
He goes up top and opens and looks into a valve, the tank is empty. 
BEAT COP Sorry. 
The cop gets in his car and prepares to drive away. 
BEAT COP (CONT'D) Why did they want it? 
ABEL They stole the $6,000 of fuel that was in it. 
The cop leaves. 
ABEL is left standing on top of the truck in the parking lot alone with his battered truck. 
He looks down at the open loading valve and begins to come up with an idea. 
The sun is setting. 
EXT. STANDARD HEATING TRUCK YARD - DAY A sign on the inside of the gate reads. "It's not safety first... 
It's safety always". 
The motor on the gate starts in and it opens. 
In drives ABEL'S car. 
INT. ANNA'S OFFICE STANDARD HEATING OIL - DAY ANNA is working away on an adding machine in her office. 
She is listening to the radio that sits behind her on the desk. 
We can see that she is in her comfort zone. 
INT. BROOKLYN ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - DAY The ASSISTANT D.A. is sitting behind his desk as DEPUTY LANGE stands off to the side. 
He is only in his early thirties but with confidence and ego to spare. 
They know each other. 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE Andrew. 17 ANDREW WALSH Lawrence. 
Thank you for seeing us on such short notice. 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE Of course. 
And Mr. Morales. 
Please sit. 
I didn't realize you were coming as well. 
ANDREW WALSH Yes... 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE So what can I do for you? 
ANDREW WALSH We need your help. 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE In what way? 
ANDREW WALSH Our trucks. 
They are being robbed. 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE (he looks over at DEPUTY LANGE) ANDREW WALSH We have a serious security issue. 
DEPUTY LANGE There have been a series of hijackings of bulk-fuel delivery vehicles. 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE Yes. 
ANDREW WALSH Our drivers are being put in danger. 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE Mr. Walsh, as I know you know, this office has been investigating your entire industry. 
ANDREW WALSH Of course. 
There is an awkward pause as LAWRENCE decides how he should continue. 18 A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE And as much as I'd like to be able to help you, you know this is a police issue. 
It's not what we do here. 
ANDREW WALSH I understand. 
But this is turning into an urgent and pressing matter for us. 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE Urgent? 
ANDREW WALSH Yes. 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE I'm not sure what you mean. 
There were more murders and rapes in this city last year then there ever have been, so if you have come to tell me that we have a urgent security issue here, trust me I'm aware. 
ABEL cuts in. 
He can't help himself. 
ABEL My people are at risk just driving around in this city, just trying to do their jobs. 
And I... 
I have done everything you have asked of me. 
It's been two years since you first started investigating my company and I have spent thousands of dollars hiring lawyers for this and that to provide you with every piece of information your office has requested. 
And I expect that you have been asking the same from my competitors. 
So with all this information that you have gained... 
We are just asking if you have any idea who has been doing this to us? 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE I don't. 
This sits unanswered. 19 A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE (CONT'D) I understand your frustration. 
And although everyone else seems to have given up and left this city for dead, I haven't. 
And as you know we have been investigating industry-wide corruption in your business that seems to have been going on for years. 
And the simple fact is that the only person who could do anything with 8000 gallons of heating oil in a matter of minutes after stealing a truck is someone from within that industry. 
And almost certainly someone with local storage capacity. 
So you're right. 
That means you all are stealing from each other. 
Which is, as far as I can tell, just a refreshing new take on what you've been doing to your customers and fellow taxpayers for the last fifteen years. 
This sits in the room for a long beat. 
ABEL First, please know that we respect the work you are doing to try to help our business and the city. 
But also know I have never taken anything I haven't earned from anyone so when you say you've... 
He pulls himself back. 
ABEL (CONT'D) We are on the same side here. 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE Well yes and no. 
See, all that I can do is to try and put people away in the simplest and most economical way possible with the limited resources at my disposal. 
It doesn't really matter to us who it is or how we do it as long as it's progress. 
ABEL Well, it makes a difference to me. 20 A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE I know it does. 
This city is a very difficult place to do business right now. 
ABEL Yes. 
This more conciliatory tone makes LAWRENCE think through his next reply for a long beat. 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE You know... 
Mr. Morales you seem like a decent man, and because of that I'm really not comfortable just sitting here with you pretending that the elephant perched on the corner of my desk isn't there. 
LAWRENCE looks over at DEPUTY LANGE whose body language says `don't go down this road'. 
But he does. 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE (CONT'D) I can't go into specifics at this moment but we believe that you and your company have broken the law and that we have enough evidence to prove that. 
So next week, Monday actually, we will be bringing a case against you. 
This drops like a bomb. 
ABEL and LAWRENCE stare at each other. 
Then ABEL glances to the corner of the desk. 
We see that a large draft copy of the case is actually sitting there. 
ABEL looks back up. 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE (CONT'D) I'm sorry to do this in person. 
It's awkward, obviously, but I didn't want to have this happen on Monday not having said something here in person today, out of respect. 
ABEL I understand. 
ABEL stands up to leave and ANDREW is still a little stunned but stands. 21 ABEL (CONT'D) You have your job to do. 
But know that you are wrong and that we will take advantage of every opportunity to prove that. 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE I'm sure you will. 
They turn to leave. 
And LAWRENCE has one more thought. 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE (CONT'D) One more thing... 
Have you been doing anything different in your business over the last year? 
ABEL I'm sorry? 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE I'm just looking here through these reports. 
It looks like out of the nineteen registered heating oil companies in the city your trucks have been getting hit three to one. 
ABEL Yes? 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE So are you maybe doing something to bring this on yourself? 
ANDREW WALSH Like what? 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE Like enter a new market? 
ABEL I am always trying to expand my business. 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE Of course. 
But I think you understand what I'm saying... there are always some markets that are more difficult than others to enter. 
ABEL Every new market is a difficult market. (MORE) 22 ABEL (CONT'D) But my driver was assaulted and my truck and oil were stolen in broad daylight in front of fifteen toll collectors and six police officers yesterday. 
And yet no one saw anything. 
That is a problem... no? 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE I have a lot of problems coming across my desk every day Mr. Morales. 
ABEL I'm sure you do. 
INT. HALLWAY OF BROOKLYN D.A. 
COURT BUILDING - DAY ABEL walks out in front of ANDREW. ANDREW WALSH Abel. 
Abel. 
He stops and turns. 
ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D) (his words escape him) ABEL Exactly. 
ANDREW WALSH No... let's not overreact. 
We don't even know what they are bringing against us. 
It could be total bullshit, and they are just trying to use us along the way. 
This isn't anything yet. 
ABEL I know. 
INT. ANNA'S OFFICE STANDARD HEATING OIL - DAY ANNA is working away on an adding machine in her office. 
She is listening to the radio that sits behind her on the desk. 
We can see that she is in her comfort zone. 
ABEL enters. 
ANNA How'd it go? 23 ABEL The DA... 
He said he's going to bring down charges on us next week. 
ANNA For what? 
ABEL We don't know yet. 
ANNA Who else? 
ABEL Right now they are just saying us. 
Beat. 
ABEL (CONT'D) Where are we exposed? 
ANNA We follow standard industry practice on every front. 
ABEL Anna? 
ANNA I need to know what they are saying we did. 
Beat. 
ABEL Okay. 
INT. HOSPITAL LONG HALLWAY - DAY ABEL walks down the long hallway and enters a room. 
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY JULIAN is sitting on the edge of the bed, waiting. 
His jaw is in bandages, and there are crutches sitting next to him, but he looks much better than the previous day. 
They look at each other intensely but say nothing. 24 INT. SHIT-HOLE TENEMENT STAIRWELL - DAY ABEL is helping JULIAN up the stairs. 
They struggle together. 
Finally they get to the top floor and stand outside apartment number . 
JULIAN stops, not really wanting to open the door in front of his boss. 
ABEL I'm very sorry this happened. 
Do you need anything else? (JULIAN nods no) If you do, you call the office... 
Okay then. 
He turns to leave and walks back to the stairs. 
JULIAN Abel? 
ABEL turns and looks at him. 
JULIAN (CONT'D) Do you think I am ready to move into sales? 
ABEL thinks this through. 
ABEL I don't. 
JULIAN I... 
I'm not sure I will be able... 
ABEL You will. 
JULIAN changes the subject. 
JULIAN Did you get the truck back? 
ABEL Yes. 
They took the load. 
JULIAN This is the sixth one? 
ABEL Seventh... you get some rest. 25 EXT. BUILDING BY ABEL'S CAR - DAY ABEL comes out of the building and walks towards his car where a group of TOUGH-LOOKING KIDS in their early twenties are sitting, looking to see who is going to come and claim the brand new car. 
He walks right though them without being overly aggressive but without a hint of being intimidated. 
He gets in and drives away. 
INT. BROOKLYN BARBERSHOP - NIGHT ABEL is sitting in the barber chair getting a trim. 
Through the window we see ARNOLD KLINE, a competitor of ABEL'S walking by. 
They see each other. 
ARNOLD KLINE comes into the shop followed by a BODYGUARD. He sits down next to ABEL. This conversation happens with them both looking at each other in the mirror. 
ARNOLD KLINE Well, look who it is. 
ABEL Arnold. 
ARNOLD KLINE Just a touch off the side Jimmy. 
Not all of us are as lucky as Mr. Morales here in terms of keeping our hair. 
BARBER JIMMY You're a good looking man. 
ARNOLD KLINE I know I am. 
So I hear congratulations are in order? 
ABEL What's that? 
ARNOLD KLINE You got yourself in contract over there. 
ABEL We are working on it. 
ARNOLD KLINE Thirty day close I hear, you better be. 
ABEL We are, thanks for your concern. 26 BARBER JIMMY finishes ABEL, and he stands up to leave. 
ABEL has his back to KLINE as he pays. 
ARNOLD KLINE I saw a couple of your trucks over in Rego Park the other day. 
This brings ABEL around to look at him square. 
ABEL Really? 
When was that? 
ARNOLD KLINE A couple times. 
ABEL It's possible. 
ARNOLD KLINE Is it? 
ABEL Yes. 
ARNOLD KLINE That's a tough market. 
ABEL It is. 
ARNOLD KLINE My father struggled for years before he broke in there. 
ABEL Any new market is a tough one. 
I'll see you. 
ABEL walks out of the shop and looks around. 
It is now dark outside. 
EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NEXT MORNING ABEL is jogging again but this time he is deep in the woods. 
He runs along the road. 
We then hear a car coming from behind him. 
The car noise then turns into more of a truck noise. 
He stops and turns around as we see a large truck coming towards him. 
He gets himself over to the side of the road. 
We have a slight fear it might hit him. 
But as it passes we see it's a large moving truck. 
There's a second one following right behind it. 27 As the trucks pass it registers on ABEL's face. 
He cuts into a path in the woods. 
EXT. DRIVEWAY ABEL walks up to his house, and we see the moving trucks preparing to unload. 
ANNA gets out of her car with the kids, and they run around and check out the house as ANNA directs the movers. 
ABEL comes up and stands next to her. 
They smile a protected smile at their new home. 
ABEL gives her a kiss. 
INT. DINING ROOM OF NEW HOUSE - NIGHT The whole family sits around the table in candlelight. 
They are eating takeout, but with a mismatch of formal and everyday tableware that has been unpacked. 
There are boxes all around them. 
ANNA I know it has been a long road, and that not all of you wanted to do this, but thank you. 
For me... 
ABEL A toast. 
All six raise a glass. 
ABEL (CONT'D) A toast to our new home. 
It's as beautiful as my wife and daughters and as strong as me...(kids laugh) May we be happy, prosperous and safe here. 
Cheers. 
INT. GYMNASIUM GIRLS YOUTH SOCCER GAME - NEXT MORNING ABEL is standing watching the game as he waits for his coffee to come out of the snack bar. 
Over his shoulder we hear... 
PETER FORENTE So you made the move? 
ABEL turns and sees PETER FORENTE standing there. 
He's in his mid-forties, very well-dressed, and handsomely bald. 
ABEL Peter... it's official as of yesterday. 28 COUNTER PERSON Sir. 
ABEL picks up his coffee, and they both walk back over to the sideline together. 
Although they are standing a bit off to the side from everyone else. 
PETER FORENTE So I heard about your rig getting picked off again. 
ABEL Yes. 
PETER FORENTE We should probably get together to discuss this and go over some of the preventative measures that we've been taking. 
We haven't had an incident since November. 
It doesn't do any of us any good to have this kind of attention brought to us. 
They both stare out at the court for beat. 
PETER FORENTE (CONT'D) So I think I may have seen one of your new trucks the other day. 
They look at each other. 
PETER FORENTE (CONT'D) Out near here, at the Miller Road diner? 
ABEL That's possible. 
PETER FORENTE The driver looked like a member of the Hitler Youth. 
I haven't seen a teamster that blond and blue-eyed since I was a kid. 
ABEL He's from Ohio. 
Played football. 
I like my drivers to fit in with the neighborhood... 
PETER FORENTE That's new territory for you, no? 
This brings them both back in to look at each other. 29 ABEL Just picked up a few new accounts over there. 
Weekend houses of some old clients from in the city. 
PETER gives a bit of a stronger look. 
Then finally turns back towards the field. 
PETER FORENTE Which one is yours? 
ABEL Right there. 
They look out. 
PETER FORENTE She's beautiful. 
ABEL Thank you. 
PETER FORENTE Welcome to the neighborhood. 
You should be proud. 
ABEL Proud? 
PETER FORENTE Yes. 
INT. GARAGE OF THE NEW HOUSE - DAY The garage is filled with boxes. 
ABEL stands in the middle of a few that are partially unpacked. 
He has set up an old radio in the corner of the garage, and it is playing a New York Giants football game. 
ABEL takes an object out of one of the boxes and looks at it with significance. 
Coming from the main house we hear the doorbell ring. 
ABEL'S oldest daughter, ANNIE, comes to the door of the garage. 
ANNIE Dad. 
Mr. Walsh is here. 
ABEL looks around behind ANNIE to see ANDREW standing there. 
He waves him into the garage. 
The boxes are stacked almost to the ceiling around them. 30 ANDREW WALSH I'm sorry for the dramatic drop in but your phone doesn't seem to be working. 
ABEL It's not set up yet... 
So I am guessing this isn't good news here on a Sunday night. 
ANDREW WALSH No... 
It looks like they are coming after us. 
ABEL That describes many people at this point. 
Slight smile. 
ANDREW WALSH The D.A. 
ABEL How bad? 
ANDREW WALSH I still haven't seen it yet. 
But my guy in his office just gave me a heads up an hour ago. 
It's not good. 
ABEL Where are we exposed? 
ANDREW WALSH I'm not sure, a couple places probably. 
ABEL A couple places? 
This hits ABEL. He thinks for a beat than goes over to the door to the house and calls for his wife. 
ABEL (CONT'D) Anna... 
Anna! They wait. 
She enters, she is a bit surprised to see ANDREW in her garage. 
ANNA Andrew. 31 ANDREW WALSH Anna... sorry you've got no phone. 
ABEL As of tomorrow I'll have my new radio hooked up though so you should be able to reach me wherever I am... 
He is making light of the situation, but as she looks at their faces she knows there is a problem. 
ANDREW WALSH The D.A. is going to bring down charges on us tomorrow. 
ANNA For what? 
ANDREW WALSH We don't know yet. 
ANNA Who else? 
ANDREW WALSH Right now they are just saying us. 
ABEL Where are we exposed? 
ABEL looks at his wife. 
She looks at ANDREW. ANNA We follow standard industry practice on every front. 
They all give each other a long look, as this means they have been bending the rules in several places, as do all their competitors. 
ABEL What does that mean? 
ANNA You know what that means. 
ANDREW WALSH It means we may have some accounting exposure where we have pushed things a little too far. 
ABEL How far? 32 ANDREW WALSH You always told us to push until we couldn't push any further. 
Well, we may have hit that line. 
So we will handle it and move on. 
ABEL Anna? 
ABEL shoots her a stinging worried glance. 
ANNA I need to know what they are saying we did. 
ANDREW WALSH Let's not get ahead of ourselves here. 
You have always followed standard industry practices. 
We aren't even sure what this is yet. 
I just wanted to make sure you had all the information I do. 
This is a badge of honor, it means we are big enough to give a shit about now. 
Don't worry. 
That sits for a beat. 
ABEL Okay. 
ANNA Thank you for coming by Andrew. 
ABEL reaches into his pocket and takes out a remote for the automatic garage door opener. 
As it opens you can see the pride in his face as this remote is a fairly high-tech new item. 
They all sit and watch as it opens the whole way then stops in silence. 
ANDREW is now standing outside in the driveway. 
ANDREW WALSH Very impressive. 
ABEL Thank you. 
ANNA It only cost him a year of the kid's tuition. 33 ANDREW WALSH And one more thing. 
I got a call from the union... 
O'Leary. 
This grabs both their attention. 
ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D) They've been getting word back from our drivers. 
ANNA What word? 
ANDREW WALSH There is real concern about their safety. 
ABEL Who? 
ANNA All of them. 
ANDREW WALSH The drivers are feeling unprotected. 
ANNA Because they are. 
ANDREW WALSH I just think you should talk to them about it. 
Before it grows into something. 
ABEL Okay. 
ANDREW WALSH Good night. 
INT. ABEL AND ANNA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT ABEL is lying in bed, awake. 
ANNA is as well. 
He is staring at the ceiling. 
Their dog is lying at the foot of the bed asleep as well. 
Eventually the dog wakes up and looks out towards the doorway. 
He growls ever so lightly. 
Then he stops, listens, and starts growling a little more. 
ANNA looks up ever so slightly. 
ANNA What's he doing? 34 ABEL is now standing up to go look. 
ABEL Quiet... don't worry. 
It's nothing. 
ANNA tries to go back to sleep. 
INT. HALLWAYS/KID'S ROOMS - NIGHT ABEL walks out of the bedroom and slowly heads down the hall to his kids' rooms. 
He looks in each room and the CHILD is sleeping soundly with nothing out of place. 
INT. KIDS' ROOMS/HALLWAY- SAME TIME As he comes out of the last bedroom back into the hallway he sees his dog standing at the top of the stairs looking down over the balcony into the living room. 
The dog is starting to quietly growl once again. 
ABEL'S face goes from total comfort that his kids are safe to total paranoia. 
He slowly walks down the hall. 
He stops off in his bedroom closet and grabs a mid-size baseball bat/billy club. 
Now he is heading down the stairs with the club trying not to freak himself out. 
INT. OPEN LIVING ROOM/ENTRY HALL/FRONT DOOR - NIGHT ABEL walks down the stairs and the dog just stands at the top, still growling every now and then. 
ABEL comes into the living room and everything seems perfectly normal. 
He then relaxes and turns towards the dog. 
ABEL Quiet. 
It's nothing. 
Come down here. 
He snaps his fingers and calls the dog. 
The dog finally comes down the stairs. 
ABEL now heads towards the kitchen in a relaxed state, but then the dog starts growling again and looking out the windows next to the front door. 
ABEL comes over, he opens the front door but the dog refuses to go out. 
ABEL (CONT'D) Go. Oh come on. 
Go. ABEL thinks he hears something. 
He clicks on the lights and pulls his bat back up into position. 
He heads outside. 35 EXT. FRONT DOOR TO ABEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT ABEL comes to the end of the front walk and there is nothing. 
The dog has now followed him outside and is slowly heading over to a area where a small exterior hallway leads to a side entrance. 
It is dark. 
The dog starts barking and going crazy. 
ABEL slowly heads over to the covered passageway. 
All hell now breaks lose. 
A BURGLAR, in all black, comes blasting out of the shadows. 
The dog tries to bite him as he goes by. 
ABEL swings his club and hits BURGLAR square on the shoulder but he keeps coming. 
He knocks ABEL over and runs towards the driveway. 
ABEL is up and chasing after him faster than we expect. 
EXT. BASE OF THE RAVINE DEEP IN WOODS- CONTINUOUS There is a pretty good moon out so we can see them running full throttle through the very thick woods. 
ABEL is keeping up with him and in fact may be gaining on him. 
ABEL is still in his pajamas. 
He has a rage that has been building up inside him for a good two weeks that is now pouring out of him in the energy to chase this guy down. 
They come to the top of a small ravine which ABEL seems to know from his runs through the woods and ABEL takes a bit of an easier/quicker path down. 
EXT. WOODS BEHIND ABEL'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ABEL now cuts him off at an angle and swings the bat at his legs. 
BURGLAR trips and goes flying. 
ABEL falls as he swings at him. 
They both sit on the ground for a beat. 
ABEL is exhausted. 
They stare at each other. 
A brief look of panic comes across BURGLAR's face. 
Then he is up again and running off into the woods. 
ABEL gets himself up and chases after him. 
EXT. ROAD NEXT TO THE WOODS - NIGHT ABEL comes out of the woods into the middle of the road, and in the distance we see BURGLAR run up to a waiting van with its lights and engine on. 
The guy gets into the passenger side of the van, and it peels out. 
ABEL is left standing in the middle of the road, barely able to breathe and holding the bat. 36 EXT. ABEL FRONT DOOR - NIGHT ABEL comes walking back towards his front door. 
ANNA is standing with all the lights on and with the dog sitting next to her. 
She looks at him in shock. 
ANNA Where were you? 
ABEL (looking to the dog) A lot of help you were. 
ANNA Abel? 
They both look down at his bare feet. 
He has been in some kind of shock and hasn't even noticed that his bare feet are cut up to pieces from running in the woods through the ice. 
His feet are bleeding all over the walkway. 
INT. POWDER ROOM OF ABEL AND ANNA'S HOUSE - NIGHT ANNA is in warrior mode. 
Any panic in her voice has disappeared, and she is speaking with a calm yet deadly seriousness. 
She is cleaning the cuts on his feet and putting bandages on them as they talk. 
ANNA Who was it? 
ABEL What do you mean, how am I supposed to know who it was? 
She gives him a look. 
ABEL (CONT'D) I don't know. 
She gives him another look. 
ABEL (CONT'D) I think it was just some punk, looking to rip us off. 
ANNA If you... 
ABEL Ouch! If they had wanted to send a message he could have... and he didn't. 37 ANNA Seems like a message was sent loud and clear. 
ABEL Please. 
Don't get going on this. 
We are a big new house. 
He probably wanted the TV. He didn't have a gun, he had nothing. 
The alarm will be in on Monday. 
It was some kid. 
They aren't coming back. 
She looks at him with considerable concern. 
He leans in and starts kissing her. 
She holds still at first then gives in. 
INT. TRAINING ROOM AT STANDARD HEATING OIL - NEXT MORNING ABEL is in a suit but is kneeling and almost lying on his back showing three SALES RECRUITS what they should be looking for. 
Another INSTRUCTOR looks on. 
We see ABEL in his element. 
He is a salesman. 
ABEL What you are looking for here is the opening to the burn chamber. 
Now at this point you have not tipped your hat in anyway. 
From the minute you walked in the house you should have been working to create an impression of total impartiality. 
But now... 
He reaches over and opens the small door. 
A fire is burning inside. 
On cue the instructor hands ABEL a crisp clean white handkerchief. 
ABEL (CONT'D) When this door opens you begin to close. 
It must always be spotless. 
If they see you have ever done this before it is over. 
He takes it and reaches up into a small exhaust chimney. 
ABEL (CONT'D) Now, you do this and only this... 
You look down at the cloth and don't say a word... 
You just keep staring at the cloth and then you slowly just start shaking your head. 
Very very slowly and small. (MORE) 38 ABEL (CONT'D) Don't look up at them. 
Just at the cloth. 
Then ABEL makes a small clicking noise. 
INSTRUCTOR Do you hear that noise... that's the noise. 
SALES STUDENT ALEX What noise? 
ABEL It means you are close... 
Then after sitting in silence way longer than is comfortable, you turn. 
And say "I'd love to run a few numbers for you. 
Is there somewhere more comfortable we could sit." They will almost always take you to the dining room table and will offer you something. 
And whatever it is you always take the fancy option. 
INSTRUCTOR Can I get you a coffee or tea? 
ABEL A tea please. 
INSTRUCTOR We have some homemade lemonade or a soda. 
ABEL I'd love a lemonade, thank you. 
SALES STUDENT ALEX Why? 
ABEL Because, we are never going to be the cheapest option, so we have to be the best. 
And they want... no, need... to feel that you want the best too. 
That's why our trucks are the newest or cleanest, and our drivers are approachable. 
Just then the woman who works behind the front desk (STANDARD FRONT DESK) comes to the door. 
STANDARD FRONT DESK They need you. 39 ABEL I gotta go, but the final point I will make is the hardest one. 
Once you have done the math and shown them what we can save them over the long haul through proper maintenance, you need them to sign. 
And the problem is by hiring you that means they are firing someone else. 
And that's never easy. 
So to get them over the line you need to close them. 
So when you show them the number look up at them both... and just stare at them... 
ABEL begins staring at the recruits. 
He continues to stare. 
ABEL (CONT'D) You stare longer than you should. 
Because this is not a joke. 
You will only keep this job if you close. 
And that's not funny to you. 
And I am only interested in this company growing, and when it isn't I don't think it's funny at all. 
These people work very hard for their money and these other guys are ripping them off, treating them poorly, because they don't know... so when you look them in the eye you have to believe that we are better, and we are, but you will never do anything as hard as staring a person straight in the eye and telling the truth. 
ABEL then does exactly that to them. 
And he holds it for a long beat. 
ABEL (CONT'D) Well... it was great to meet you. 
Welcome and I wish you luck. 
ABEL walks out of the room and straight into. 
INT. LARGE STAFF MEETING ROOM - DAY There is a great high/low nature to the way ABEL runs the company. 
While he wears great suits and his trucks are impeccable, he does not waste money. 
So this room where the drivers have company meetings is very basic. 40 The room is filled with all of the drivers. 
There is a bit of a nervous energy in the room. 
It quiets as ABEL comes in. 
He stands aside. 
STANDARD FRONT DESK Trucks 16 through 23 you should be ready to go... 
As STANDARD FRONT DESK sees ABEL standing behind her, she stops. 
ABEL walks forward a few steps. 
ABEL Good morning. 
First off, I picked up Julian yesterday and he is back home and doing much better. 
And I just wanted to make sure you are all aware that we are doing everything we can to deal with this situation. 
We are working with law enforcement, and they seem to be closing in on these guys. 
But, sadly these are the times we are living in and we must rise above them. 
So, on that front we have these. 
He puts one of the new radios on the dais. 
ANDREW comes into the room behind ABEL and stands. 
ABEL (CONT'D) These will be in every truck by the end of the week. 
Much to my wife's concern I spent some serious coin and we now have our own closed channel that shouldn't have any blackout areas. 
You will always be in contact with us. (a hand goes up in the BACK) Yes, Eddy. 
SENIOR DRIVER EDDY I have heard that the union is considering recommending other more active options for us to consider. 
Do you know about this? 
ABEL looks to ANDREW. ABEL We have been in constant contact with the union and they aren't considering any new course of action at this time. 41 SENIOR DRIVER EDDY So this radio is what we got? 
ABEL Yes. 
EXT. ABEL AND ANNA'S HOUSE - DAY ANNA is walking back from the mailbox looking through the day's mail. 
As she approaches the house she looks up and sees the two younger daughters, ELIZABETH (6 years old) and CATHERINE (4 years old), playing in front of the house. 
CATHERINE comes out from under a bush near the side door with something in her hand. 
ANNA looks back down at the mail. 
As she gets closer to the house we see a look of concern come across her face. 
The look then turns to one of complete horror but as she gets closer to CATHERINE she tries to control her emotions. 
ANNA Catherine... 
Catherine. 
Katie! She drops the mail. 
And goes right up to her daughter. 
CATHERINE Mommy. 
As ANNA comes up to CATHERINE we now see that the little girl is holding a large very real looking handgun in her little hands. 
ANNA is besides herself. 
ANNA Where did you get this? 
Catherine where did you find this? 
CATHERINE Right here. 
The little girl points over towards the bushes near the side door where LOUIS SERVIDIO was hiding and got hit the night before. 
ANNA Show me. 
The little girl walks over to bushes and kneels down. 
CATHERINE It was just sitting right here. 
ANNA turns to the middle daughter, ELIZABETH. 42 ANNA Did you see this? 
ELIZABETH Yeah, she went under there to get that ball and came out with it. 
ANNA Maria! ANNA yells towards in the house. 
ELIZABETH What is it? 
ANNA walks towards the front door to retrieve the NANNY MARIA. ANNA Maria! ELIZABETH Mom, is it real? 
INT. ABEL'S OFFICE STANDARD HEATING OIL - DAY ABEL is sitting down at his desk. 
ANNA comes to the door. 
She gets his attention and then walks right up to the desk. 
She puts the handgun down right in front of him. 
ABEL What is that? 
ANNA A gun... 
It's a gun Abel. 
ABEL Where did you get it? 
ANNA Your youngest daughter found it in the bushes outside our front door. 
She was playing with it. 
ABEL is totally speechless. 
ANNA (CONT'D) It's loaded... with the safety off. 
This sits like a bomb in the room. 43 ANNA (CONT'D) Those weren't kids looking to rip off our TV Abel, that was a fucking goon with a loaded gun looking in our windows! What the hell is going on here? 
ABEL Let me see that. 
I'll take care of this. 
ANNA Damn right we will. 
Who is this? 
ABEL I don't know, but I will take care of it. 
ANNA What does that mean you will take care of it. 
This isn't a brick through our car window or some other cute little warning that I've put up with in the past. 
This is your daughter playing with a loaded gun! He turns back quickly. 
And stares at her. 
ABEL (YELLS) I know what it is! He slowly walks back across the room and picks up the gun. 
His hand shows a shake ever so slightly as he touches it. 
ABEL (CONT'D) Let me deal with this. 
ANNA You better. 
Because you won't like what's going to happen once I start getting involved. 
This causes him to stop in his tracks. 
He turns very seriously. 
ABEL You are not to tell your father about this. 
She looks back at him with a tinge of a smile. 44 ABEL (CONT'D) Do you hear me. 
ANNA'S look changes and she understands. 
ANNA ...I won't. 
ANDREW comes to the door and knocks. 
ANDREW WALSH Can I talk with you both? 
ANNA I found a gun outside our front door. 
Somebody left it there last night. 
ANDREW WALSH Who? 
ABEL I don't know. 
ANNA looks over to ANDREW letting him know her disgust. 
ANDREW WALSH Well... 
He looks around then closes the door behind him and gets their attention. 
ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D) It's not good... 
It's bad He takes out a folder containing the formal indictment and hands it to ABEL. ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D) It's a fourteen count indictment. 
Most of it is crap. 
Piggyback issues. 
But... 
As ANDREW keeps talking, trucks go rumbling by behind them. 
ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D) The first three counts are where we start to have real issues. 
They know what's going on in this industry. 
They say we are rigging scales and under-reporting income. 
We don't know what they have or how they got it. 
But no matter how they got it, it's a problem. 45 ABEL That truck just went out filthy. 
ABEL looks out the window as a truck leaves the yard. 
ANNA Abel! ANDREW WALSH We are going to owe them some money. 
This brings him back. 
ABEL How much? 
ANDREW WALSH That depends on a bunch of factors. 
But that's an accounting question. 
They both look to ANNA ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D) And there is one other thing. 
The bank... 
This hits ABEL. ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D) We need to sit down with them immediately. 
I set a dinner. 
We need you both there to lay everything out and be totally up- front. 
This shouldn't be a problem. 
Lord knows they've given money to bigger crooks than us. 
But I don't want us hiding anything from them. 
ABEL does not like this joke. 
ABEL You need to get home and start going through our set of books. 
How far back are they going? 
ANDREW WALSH Seems like all the way back to when you bought out Anna's father. 
ANNA I'll get into it. 46 He looks out the window and sees a Cadillac pull in.. 
ABEL What is O'Leary doing here?. 
Abel looks to ANDREW. ANDREW WALSH He's been wanting to talk to you for days. 
ABEL (under his breath) Jesus. 
ABEL gets up to go out. 
As ANDREW shuffles to leave ANNA STOPS HIM: ANNA Andrew can I talk to you for a minute. 
ABEL leaves and they stay. 
EXT. STANDARD HEATING OIL YARD - DAY ABEL How are you Bill? 
BILL O'LEARY I'm ok. 
Can't say I'm used to making house calls like this anymore though. 
ABEL I would have come to see you. 
BILL O'LEARY That's alright. 
You've got bigger things to worry about. (Long pause) So, I can't have this situation with your guys continuing. 
ABEL My guys. 
BILL O'LEARY Your drivers. 47 ABEL Good. 
I would love you to help on this. 
Because I can't have it going on any longer either. 
BILL O'LEARY So let them protect themselves, that would stop all this very quickly. 
ABEL I respectfully disagree. 
BILL O'LEARY They are picking on your men because they are just sitting there... weak. 
ABEL They are taking shots at me because I am growing, expanding, getting stronger not weaker. 
This frustrates Bill because he knows ABEL is right. 
He tries a new tack. 
BILL O'LEARY It's quite simple for me: I can't have my drivers getting hit like this. 
It looks like I can't protect them. 
ABEL Well, it appears that you can't. 
This is a little too sharp for the head of the NYC teamster's taste. 
BILL O'LEARY I can. 
And will. 
Because of all my job descriptions that is the one I consider most sacred. 
ABEL I agree. 
But these are truck drivers, not soldiers, this will lead to chaos. 
BILL O'LEARY It will stop immediately. 
ABEL No, it won't. 48 He resets, again. 
BILL O'LEARY You seem to be under pressure from many sides right now... which I understand. 
Trust me I understand. 
So let me think this through. 
But whatever decision I make on this, it stands. 
Those men show up every morning for you because I tell them to. 
It's important for you to realize that these are very dangerous times, and we need to adapt. 
It's not like when we were driving. 
ABEL Yes. 
BILL O'LEARY Sometimes the weak man is the stronger man if he has the right tools. 
ABEL It may seem that way... but if you are weak eventually it will show... it always does. 
And if you want this to all be behind us, help me find out who is doing this. 
You know a lot of people, and that would be the most help to me. 
BILL O'LEARY It's not always as simple as it appears. 
ABEL I'm sure that's true. 
BILL O'LEARY It is... well, I got to get going. 
ABEL Thank you for coming Bill. 
EXT. GATE AT STANDARD HEATING OIL - DAY O'LEARY walks over to ANDREW as he is getting in his car. 
ANDREW WALSH How did that go? 49 BILL O'LEARY Not well. 
ANDREW WALSH He feels very strongly about this. 
BILL O'LEARY I can see that. 
ANDREW WALSH I don't think he fully understands it. 
BILL O'LEARY What's to understand? 
ANDREW WALSH It's illegal. 
BILL O'LEARY It's not illegal if I say it isn't. 
My responsibility is to provide safe and timely passage of goods and products into and around this city. 
And because of this situation it is appearing to those whose opinions I care about that I can't do my job. 
That can not and will not continue. 
ANDREW WALSH I understand. 
BILL O'LEARY So talk to him. 
You need to protect yourself. 
This is very serious. 
Just know that. 
ANDREW thinks this through. 
ANDREW WALSH How would this work? 
BILL O'LEARY What does that mean? 
ANDREW WALSH I guess I'm not even sure exactly what you are suggesting. 
BILL O'LEARY Are you kidding me with this? 50 ANDREW WALSH No. BILL O'LEARY Every driver in your fleet gets a handgun. 
ANDREW WALSH And a permit? 
O'LEARY nods yes. 
ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D) When? 
BILL O'LEARY By Friday. 
ANDREW WALSH Are the permits legit? 
BILL O'LEARY That depends what they do with it. 
If they kill their wife with them, then no. 
Then that is a very fake permit, and I'll walk away very quickly. 
But they just need to show that they are defending themselves, and this will stop. 
ANDREW WALSH Who is it? 
BILL O'LEARY I don't fucking know... 
ANDREW WALSH I'll talk to him. 
INT. MORALES' GARAGE - DAY ANNA is struggling through the boxes in the garage. 
She moves some things and then finds what she is looking for. 
A pile of about nine matching file boxes that are all labeled the same. 
It is their off the books bookkeeping. 
INT. STUDY/LIBRARY OF THE NEW HOUSE - DAY The library is filled with custom made bookshelves that are still waiting to be filled. 
There is a large desk sitting in the corner that hasn't been fully unpacked yet. 51 ANNA comes in struggling carrying the file boxes from the garage, she piles them on the desk. 
She looks around her feet at the pile, it's literally the skeletons from her closet. 
She resets, walks over to the window to look out over her new beautiful home. 
Then she turns back at the pile of boxes that hold their past and their future. 
EXT. LONG SUBURBAN DRIVEWAY - DAY A Standard Oil DRIVER steers his truck down the driveway. 
As he approaches the end he sees a massive bulk oil truck of one of their competitors parked blocking the exit of the driveway. 
He stops his truck and gets out warily. 
He looks around. 
No one is in the cab of the truck. 
But he sees a small note taped to the window. 
It reads: "Engine trouble, back later... 
Fuck you." INT. STUDY/LIBRARY OF THE NEW HOUSE The phone starts ringing. 
ANNA gets up from her work and answers it. 
We stay on her as she gets the news. 
ANNA He's not here. 
Her face fills with building anger as she hears. 
ANNA (CONT'D) Okay. 
I will. 
ANNA hangs up the phone and walks over to the window and looks out and over at the other main wing of her new beautiful home. 
Then she turns back and looks at the pile of boxes that hold their past and their future. 
EXT. GATE AT STANDARD HEATING OIL O'LEARY walks over to ANDREW as he is getting in his car. 
ANDREW WALSH How did that go? 
BILL O'LEARY Not well. 
ANDREW WALSH He feels very strongly about this. 52 BILL O'LEARY I can see that. 
ANDREW WALSH I don't think he fully understands it. 
BILL O'LEARY What's to understand? 
ANDREW WALSH It's illegal. 
BILL O'LEARY It's not illegal if I say it isn't. 
This takes ANDREW back a step. 
BILL O'LEARY (CONT'D) My responsibility is to provide safe and timely passage of goods and products into and around this city. 
And because of this situation it is appearing to those whose opinions I am concerned with, that I can't do that right now. 
That can not and will not continue. 
ANDREW WALSH I understand. 
BILL O'LEARY So talk to him. 
You need to protect yourself. 
As a company. 
ANDREW WALSH I will try to talk with him. 
BILL O'LEARY This is very serious. 
Just know that. 
ANDREW WALSH thinks this through. 
ANDREW WALSH How would this work? 
BILL O'LEARY What does that mean? 
ANDREW WALSH I guess I'm not even sure exactly what you are suggesting. 53 BILL O'LEARY Are you kidding me with this? 
ANDREW WALSH No. BILL O'LEARY Every driver in your fleet gets a handgun. 
ANDREW WALSH And a permit? 
O'LEARY nods yes. 
ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D) When? 
BILL O'LEARY By Friday. 
ANDREW WALSH Are the permits legit? 
BILL O'LEARY That depends what they do with it. 
If they kill their wife with them, then no. 
Then that is a very fake permit, and I'll walk away very quickly. 
But they just need to show that they are defending themselves, and this will stop. 
ANDREW WALSH Who is it? 
BILL O'LEARY I don't fucking know... 
INT. ABEL'S OFFICE - LATER ANDREW comes to the door. 
ABEL is staring out the window but looks up as ANDREW sits down. 
ANDREW WALSH They just got another truck. 
ABEL I know. 
ANDREW WALSH Who was driving? 54 ABEL Leo. 
ANDREW WALSH Is he alright? 
ABEL Yes. 
ANDREW WALSH The drivers' security aside... this shit is starting to have a very significant financial effect on us here. 
It can't continue. 
ABEL I know. 
ANDREW WALSH How was your talk? (nothing) I spoke with him after. 
He's going to keep going `til he gets the answer he's looking for. 
ABEL I said I wouldn't do it. 
They sit for a long beat. 
ANDREW WALSH I'm not sure we are in a position to say that. 
ABEL What's that? 
ANDREW looks around. 
He's getting paranoid. 
ANDREW WALSH Do you want to go for a walk? 
ABEL Are you really serious with this, this is what it's come to, walking around outside like fucking gangsters? 
ANDREW WALSH I am and it is. 55 EXT. STANDARD HEATING OIL TRUCK - DAY Throughout this conversation ABEL is walking over to a section of the yard where WORKERS are loading some sort of additive chemical to the fuel trucks. 
ANDREW WALSH It is looking like we must do this. 
ABEL I must? 
This gets a little personal. 
ANDREW WALSH They will shut you down. 
ABEL These men, they work for me. 
These trucks they drive, the customers they serve. 
They are here because we built this. 
ANDREW WALSH That's true, until its not. 
And the last person in the world right now that we need working against us is the president of the fucking teamsters. 
This company is out of business in a month if he gets these guys to walk. 
We are running out of cash. 
ABEL What are you even talking about here? 
ANDREW WALSH The union provides a handgun and a permit to every one of the drivers. 
And they think this whole thing is over in a week. 
ABEL These men are fucking truck drivers. 
This is insane. 
You know who is gonna get it in the end here, me. 
This comes back to me. 
ANDREW WALSH It does either way. 
ABEL I'm not doing it. 56 ANDREW WALSH Would you put everything at risk to stand by that. 
ABEL thinks this through. 
ABEL It will be the end of everything I have worked for. 
If one of these guys shoots somebody it's me they will bring down for it...I'll talk to him... 
And we need to close this deal. 
We can't stay like this any longer. 
We must close on that property... 
We are so weak right now. 
They are now standing on top of one of the trucks tanks as a worker pours the additive into the tank. 
The container says "GREEN DYE #7" on it. 
ABEL looks down as it flows in. 
He stands up and looks out across the fence at the container property. 
ANDREW WALSH Why do you want this so badly? 
ABEL Because I have my entire savings at risk with this deposit. 
It is everything. 
ANDREW WALSH That's not what I mean. 
Why did you want it so badly in the first place? 
It was a risk... always. 
ABEL thinks this through. 
ABEL I don't know. 
ANDREW WALSH You don't know? 
Have you ever thought about it? 
ABEL I've thought about it every day for the last five years. 
This place was sitting over that fence mocking.... 
ANDREW WALSH I didn't mean have you ever thought about that place... (MORE) 57 ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D) I mean have you ever thought why you want it so badly? 
ABEL I don't know what you mean. 
ABEL looks to him in a sincere way wanting him to answer but ANDREW just waits. 
Finally. 
ABEL (CONT'D) I know what you are asking and no... 
I never ask myself why I do this. 
It just feels right... wanting to be bigger feels better. 
It feels right. 
ANDREW WALSH That's very simple. 
ABEL Yes... 
With this he gives him a deadly serious look. 
ABEL (CONT'D) ...It is. 
ANDREW WALSH You take these risks... 
ABEL Only when necessary. 
ANDREW WALSH We have to get going, we need them to show up. 
INT. WHITE TABLECLOTH RESTAURANT - NIGHT ANNA leads the boys to the table, and we see a whole new side to her. 
She is going to get this done. 
As they approach the table we see two BANKERS stand to greet them. 
The Bank President, ARTHUR LEWIS, and Bank VP IAN THOMPSON. ANNA Arthur. 
ARTHUR LEWIS Anna, you look amazing as always. 
ANNA Thank you. 58 ARTHUR LEWIS Gentlemen. 
Do you know Ian Thompson? 
One of our new VP's. 
ANNA Ian. 
They all shake hands and sit. 
The WAITER comes over. 
WAITER So what can I get you to drink? 
ABEL A lot. 
Awkward laughter. 
ABEL (CONT'D) A wine list please. 
WAITER I'll be right back. 
ARTHUR LEWIS So how are you? 
ABEL We've been better... but we are good. 
ARTHUR LEWIS Yes I heard about that... if you stay in business long enough it's bound to happen eventually. 
ANNA Well that's exactly right. 
And we wanted to sit down with you tonight to make sure we were being totally up-front with everything that is going on and make sure that you understand the nature of the complaints and are comfortable that it is not going to affect our business in an adverse way. 
ANDREW WALSH Did you have a chance to look over the outline that I sent over? 
ARTHUR LEWIS Yes, we did. 59 ANNA Hopefully it made clear that even in a worst case situation we will pay off any and all fines and be able to move forward with very comfortable capital on hand. 
ABEL jumps in taking some offense. 
ABEL But you should know Arthur that this man has been digging through our industry for over two years looking for anything he can find. 
And as you know probably better than anyone, having worked with some of our competitors the thought that he would have singled us out is ridiculous. 
It reeks of everything that is wrong with this city right now. 
We run a fair and clean business and follow every standard industry practice and I will fight `til my last day to prove that... 
This silences the table for a long beat. 
ABEL (CONT'D) But... but... 
ABEL holds up his finger and points at ARTHUR across the table to make his point. 
ABEL (CONT'D) ...Don't think for a moment that I am going to allow this mess to interfere with our plan to grow. 
We need to know you are standing by us. 
BANK VP IAN THOMPSON Yes, what is it with this piece of property that you find so integral or that can't be put off `til after this legal matter is dealt with? 
ABEL is a little taken aback by this comment. 
It goes against everything that comes naturally to him as a person. 
ANNA and ANDREW know this and are concerned he might go off. 
ABEL thinks it through. 60 ABEL That's a very good question. 
This property gives us many things... firstly direct access to the river. 
So I can bring in fuel directly from any provider in the world straight to my tanks, then it has over 10 million gallons of storage capacity, so I can buy in the summers when my price is low and sell to my customers and most importantly some of my competitors when the price is high. 
I won't just drive trucks anymore... 
I will control my fate... but the real answer to your question... 
Now ABEL stares right at IAN THOMPSON. ABEL (CONT'D) ... is that when it feels scary to jump Ian... that is exactly when you must jump... or you risk ending up staying in the same place your whole life... and that I can't do. 
IAN THOMPSON awkwardly laughs a bit as ABEL just stays deadly serious staring right at him. 
Finally. 
ARTHUR LEWIS We've always been there with you and know that we will continue to be. 
INT. ABEL'S CAR - NIGHT ABEL is driving, and ANNA sits in silence looking out the passenger window. 
They are heading along the main backwoods road to their house. 
ANNA Well, that went about as well as could be expected. 
ABEL Yes. 
Arthur is a good man. 
ANNA Do you think they will close? 
ABEL Of course. 61 Just as he says this a deer comes running out in front of them. 
ABEL tries to slam on the brakes but isn't able to stop in time. 
The car hits the deer and it careens over the windshield and on to the road behind the car. 
He continues to slam on the brakes and comes to a complete stop. 
They both catch their breath and look around to make sure they are both okay. 
Then they look back at the deer. 
It is laying on the road but is still breathing. 
ABEL (CONT'D) Are you okay? 
ANNA Yes... you need to go put it out of its misery. 
ABEL Jesus. 
ANNA I mean it. 
We can't just leave it here. 
EXT. BACKWOODS ROAD - NIGHT ABEL gets out of the car and looks at his smashed hood. 
He then walks back and approaches the animal. 
It is laying on the side of the road. 
He comes right up to it and stares into its eyes. 
It stares back at him. 
ABEL walks back to the car. 
ANNA Is it dead? 
ABEL No. ANNA Well you need... 
ABEL I know. 
He reaches down to open the trunk. 
ANNA What are you doing? 62 ABEL Getting the tire iron! This whole situation has stressed them out and they are on edge. 
ABEL goes to the trunk and gets out the large wrench. 
He walks back over to the deer. 
He bends down next to it and stares into its eye again. 
ABEL is thinking back on something, or many things. 
He makes a small starting movement like he is going to hit it over the head but he stops himself. 
He can't quite do it. 
Then he sits with the animal a beat longer. 
We come in very close to ABEL and see his hand is struggling to deliver the blow. 
Just as he grips the tire iron waiting... 
BANG! BANG! Two very loud GUNSHOTS go off from right over his shoulder. 
He ducks for cover then slowly turns behind him. 
ANNA stands there holding a small-yet-powerful Saturday Night Special- style handgun. 
Smoke is still rising from the end of the pistol. 
The deer is dead. 
He looks at her dumbfounded... where did she get this gun? 
She gives him a look. 
Then turns and walks back to the car. 
He stays and struggles to get the deer out of the road. 
INT. ABEL'S DAMAGED CAR - NIGHT ANNA is sitting in the car waiting. 
We hear ABEL'S footsteps as he approaches the open driver's side door. 
He gets in without saying a word. 
We stay with them as they drive on in silence. 
INT. MORALES HOUSE, FRONT HALLWAY - NIGHT The door opens and ABEL walks in. 
ANNA is already in the house talking with NANNY MARIA who's been baby-sitting. 
ANNA Hello Maria, sorry we are a bit late. 
They were fine? 
NANNY MARIA Oh yes. 
All is good. 
ANNA Great, thank you. 
We'll see you in the morning then. 63 NANNY MARIA Okay. 
NANNY MARIA comes around the corner and passes ABEL who is just standing in the living room. 
He only gives her a nod. 
ANNA is standing on the other side of the room just waiting in silence as well. 
NANNY MARIA goes over to the closet and gets her coat out and puts it on. 
The tension is building like a kettle. 
Finally NANNY MARIA gets herself together and walks out and as the door shuts they come immediately at each other. 
ANNA What? 
ABEL What? 
ANNA Yes... what? 
ABEL Are you kidding? 
ANNA No. ABEL Okay then... what is this gun? 
ANNA I told you I wasn't going to just continue to stand around and let these people come and get me and my children. 
So unlike you who seems to be totally comfortable just standing around like some... fucking pussy... 
I did something about it. 
ABEL is slightly stammering at this point, not quite sure what to do. 
They are still standing on opposite sides of the room from each other. 
He just waits... finally. 
ABEL Where did you get it? 
ANNA You know where I got it. 
ABEL Do you have a permit? 64 ANNA Not yet. 
This sets him off. 
He comes walking across the room at her as if he might hit her. 
He gets closer and closer. 
ABEL You must be a bigger fucking idiot than I even thought. 
You are trying to protect your children? 
Protect them? 
Do you have any idea what happens if you get caught using that thing? 
He is now standing right over her. 
ABEL (CONT'D) You dress yourself up in these fancy clothes, and look at you here in your mansion. 
I've given you everything you could possibly want but you still can't stop thinking like the Brooklyn corner-store gangster's daughter that you are. 
ANNA You've given me? 
You? 
Are you delusional? 
Do you even understand how ridiculous that makes you sound? 
They are really going at it now. 
He tries to grab her purse, which she still has over her shoulder. 
They struggle for it. 
ABEL Where is this thing? 
Let me see it. 
ANNA Abel. 
ABEL Let me see it. 
Is this going to make you safe? 
With that he uses brute force, probably hurting her arm, but she doesn't let on. 
He takes the purse from her. 
He opens it and takes out the small gun. 
ABEL (CONT'D) You know who uses guns like this? (HE SCREAMS) Whores! 65 With that, she SLAPS him across the face. 
They just stare at each other for a very long time. 
ABEL (CONT'D) It's a trap... and you are walking right into it... 
You need to get that thing out of our house. 
ANNA You need to protect us. 
ABEL That is what I'm doing. 
He walks out the front door. 
INT. MAIN LIVING/DINING ROOM OF MORALES HOUSE - NEXT DAY There are twelve SEVEN-YEAR-OLDS sitting around the dining room table yelling "Happy Birthday" to one of the Morales daughters as she blows out the candles. 
A large GROUP of the PARENTS surround the table. 
GROUP Happy Birthday! Just as ELIZABETH blows out the candles the doorbell rings. 
NANNY MARIA heads to the front door. 
The camera stays with the party. 
NANNY MARIA comes back into the room and standing behind her, we see a POLICE OFFICER holding some kind of clipboard. 
ABEL walks over quickly trying not to create a scene. 
He leads the POLICE OFFICER back over to the front door. 
The PARENTS certainly notice and start stirring. 
EXT. FRONT STEPS - DAY ABEL leads the OFFICER outside, and as he looks up he sees that his driveway is packed with four police cars, some unmarked and there are about five OFFICERS waiting to come into the house. 
ABEL I understand. 
But as you can see this is a terrible time for us. 
I am having my daughter's birthday party. 
ABEL is trying to remain calm and not lose his temper. 66 POLICE OFFICER I understand and I apologize, I do. 
But this is a warrant and we need to gain complete access to the property. 
They stare at each other just as ANNA comes to the door. 
She sees the scene in her driveway. 
ANNA What is this? 
POLICE OFFICER Let me go check something. 
ANNA Are they serious? 
ABEL is seething and can only manage a slight nod. 
As they look across the driveway they see the OFFICER talking to someone. 
The officer shifts out of the way and they see he is talking to ASSISTANT D.A. 
LAWRENCE. ABEL I'm going to kill this guy. 
ANNA Abel. 
ANNA is trying to get his attention quietly. 
ABEL Abel. 
He turns and they look at each other. 
She signals towards the library and they share a knowing, concerned glance. 
ABEL (CONT'D) Give me five minutes. 
She nods and heads down the path towards the police and LAWRENCE. Abel heads back in the doorway. 
ABEL (CONT'D) Maria. 
Keep the kids playing for a few minutes. 
ANNA walks up to the LAWRENCE. ANNA Mr. Lawrence is it? 67 A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE Yes. 
ANNA Anna Morales. 
She reaches out her hand to shake his with a smile. 
ANNA (CONT'D) May I speak with you for a minute. 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE (thinks, then) Yeah. 
They walk away from the others down the driveway a stretch. 
ANNA I understand you and your men have a job to do here. 
But we are in the middle of a seven-year-old's birthday party. 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE I understand, and I'm sorry. 
But we are coming in. 
She turns a little on him. 
ANNA That's not a problem, as we have nothing to hide from you. 
It's just that, we recently moved to this area, and there are twenty guests in our house... please... can you give me five minutes so we can ask everyone to leave calmly before you come into my home? 
He thinks this through. 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE You can get them out of the house. 
ANNA Thank you. 
INT./EXT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE STUDY/DECK ABEL comes down the hall carrying file boxes and brings them out onto the deck. 
ANNA comes out onto the deck as he is looking over the edge. 68 ANNA Where are you going? 
ABEL Bring the last few out. 
ANNA You've got three minutes. 
ABEL What's going on out there. 
ANNA Our guests are leaving. 
ABEL tries to speak but can only shake his head. 
Finally he jumps over the edge and she starts handing boxes down to him. 
He then stops again. 
ABEL Do we even need to be doing this? 
What exactly are we hiding here? 
She thinks this through. 
ANNA I don't want them going through all this before I've had a chance to. 
EXT. GROUND BELOW DECK The camera is now on the ground level with ABEL. ABEL Is that the last one. 
Get back out there. 
ABEL looks around for a place to stash them. 
EXT. WOODS - DAY ABEL exhales then takes three of the boxes and sneaks off into the woods. 
We follow him as he struggles. 
Finally he gets to a small clearing and starts to stack them. 
EXT. FRONT LAWN - DAY ANNA is standing out front trying to hand out goody bags and to maintain pleasantries with the parents as they leave. 69 ANNA Thank you for coming. 
Here you go. 
Bye, Rebecca. 
Thanks. 
I'm sorry. 
Bye. 
When the last one goes she looks up at the ASST. DA to give him the all-clear. 
But as she does she gives him a look that could kill. 
The police file into the house in front of her. 
EXT. UNDERNEATH THE DECK - DAY ABEL has placed the load of file boxes underneath the deck and is putting the last one in place. 
He sits down on the pile and looks out into the woods in sadness. 
INT. MAIN LIVING/DINING ROOM OF MORALES HOUSE ANNA is looking around the house as the cops search through everything. 
She seems oddly calm. 
She decides that they are being respectful and heads out into the driveway. 
EXT. DRIVEWAY ANNA walks outside and stands, waiting. 
LAWRENCE comes out of the house and stands near her. 
They wait. 
ANNA This is probably one that you are going to regret. 
LAWRENCE looks at her trying to figure her out. 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE Excuse me? 
ANNA My husband is a very honorable man. 
Coming on a Saturday? 
It's very aggressive. 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE This is standard. 
ANNA Really? 
I know you think you are just doing your job. 
But we are not what you think we are. 
And you have embarrassed him in front of his family and friends. 
She gives him a long, almost scary look. 70 A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE I think I know your father. 
ANNA Good for you. 
My husband is not my father. 
Not even close. 
So if I were you I would start treating us with a little more respect or he'll make it our only mission to ruin you. 
This was very disrespectful... and you are not going to find a fucking thing. 
With that she walks back towards the house as the POLICE start filing out. 
INT. ABEL'S OFFICE - MORNING ABEL is sitting at his desk looking out the window as the trucks come and go. 
As he looks across the lot he sees JULIAN coming walking across towards the locker room. 
A smile crosses ABEL'S face. 
INT. STANDARD HEATING OIL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS As ABEL comes out into the hallway SALES STUDENT ALEX is walking by his door. 
ABEL stops to check in. 
ABEL Hey, how are you? 
SALES STUDENT ALEX Good. 
A bit nervous. 
I'm heading out on my first calls alone today. 
ABEL You'll do great. 
Remember... 
When you get them there. 
Hold the eye contact longer than you would like... but you watch what happens. 
He gives him a big smile and a pat on the back and sends him on his way. 
ABEL (CONT'D) Good luck. 
INT. DRIVER LOCKER ROOM- DAY ABEL comes into the room and JULIAN is getting ready. 71 ABEL It is good to see you back here. 
You look good. 
JULIAN Thank you. 
JULIAN is very quiet and timid. 
He is missing a spark. 
ABEL Are you ready to get back to work? 
JULIAN I think so. 
ABEL You are. 
JULIAN Thank you. 
ABEL Where are you heading? 
JULIAN Bulk delivery to Chase. 
ABEL Manhattan. 
That's a cakewalk. 
JULIAN does not agree. 
ABEL can no longer ignore his young protege's concern. 
JULIAN I feel very vulnerable. 
ABEL jumps on this. 
ABEL Good... 
Because you are. 
We all are. 
Someone came to my house a couple nights ago to rob me... 
A large truck rumbles by and they wait for silence to return. 
ABEL (CONT'D) I tried to chase them away... but really there's nothing I can do. 
I am vulnerable. 
We all are. 
They can come back tonight. 
But to succeed and be great you must keep going back. 
And I know what all these guys want to be doing. 
But it doesn't make you any safer. (MORE) 72 ABEL (CONT'D) And then they will come after me with everything they have... 
So this is what we do. 
And the times will get better and safer. 
They will. 
So go. 
You are strong just by going. 
Stronger in fact. 
JULIAN looks down at the ground, shuffles a foot, then climbs into the waiting truck. 
EXT. FRONT PORCH SMALL OF HOUSE IN OZONE PARK - DAY SALES STUDENT ALEX gets out of his car and walks up to the front door. 
He is nervous. 
He builds the courage and finally rings the doorbell. 
He waits. 
The door opens and a nice lady in her 40's comes to the door. 
SALES STUDENT ALEX Hi Mrs. 
Rose. 
I'm Alex with Standard Heating Oil, we had an appointment. 
MRS. ROSE Of course, come in. 
INT. CAB OF LARGE BULK OIL TRUCK - DAY JULIAN is back behind the wheel and trying to convince himself that all is well. 
He is making a difficult right turn to get onto the 59th Street Bridge. 
INT. OZONE PARK HOUSE BASEMENT - DAY SALES STUDENT ALEX is now leaning down on the ground next to the furnace doing the exact same procedure that ABEL did in the training session. 
SALES STUDENT ALEX Now as I mentioned on the phone this is a 17 point inspection that will help us to decipher if our maintenance plan will improve your efficiency. 
Just then he brings out the white cloth and wipes the inside of the exhaust. 
And he then does the pause and the look just as he was taught. 
He holds the look for a very long beat. 
We hear a door opening upstairs and then feet walking across the floor. 73 MRS. ROSE Oh good, it's my husband. 
SALES STUDENT ALEX Great. 
INT. TRUCK CAB, 59TH STREET BRIDGE - DAY JULIAN is up on the bridge moving slowly along with the traffic. 
He is getting paranoid. 
Looking in his rearview mirror. 
Looking around. 
But there is nothing. 
No one. 
INT. OZONE PARK HOUSE BASEMENT - DAY The SALES KID is still on his knees next to the furnace as feet come into frame coming down the basement steps. 
Slowly the HUSBAND comes into frame. 
MRS. ROSE Here he is. 
The SALES KID stands up to shake his hand. 
SALES STUDENT ALEX Mr. Rose, I am Alex with Standard Heating Oil. 
HUSBAND Hey. 
SALES STUDENT ALEX I was just showing your wife the results of my inspection. 
Should we head upstairs to run through some numbers? 
HUSBAND Sure. 
I just had one question about our exhaust chimney. 
Would you be willing to take a look. 
SALES STUDENT ALEX Of course. 
HUSBAND It's just outside on the other side of this wall here. 
MRS. ROSE I'm going to head up. 
Can I get you something to drink? 
Coffee... tea? 74 The KID gives himself an ever-so-tiny smile. 
SALES STUDENT ALEX Tea would be great. 
The man walks over to a back basement door and opens it. 
He ushers the SALES KID through. 
HUSBAND Please. 
I/E. 
DOORWAY OZONE PARK BASEMENT - DAY As the SALES KID goes through the door a massive fist of SOMEONE who has been waiting on the other side of the door comes swinging into frame and pounds the side of our KID'S head. 
Knocking him out instantly. 
INT. TRUCK CAB, 59TH STREET BRIDGE RAMP - DAY JULIAN is close to getting off the bridge and is starting to feel better. 
Just as the traffic in front of him starts to clear up, out of the corner of his eye he sees something. 
In his side-view mirror he sees LOUIS SERVIDIO getting out of a random car behind him. 
His heart starts racing. 
He looks over in the other mirror and there is THUG #2 walking up. 
Again. 
JULIAN thinks for a second then reaches for the CB RADIO. JULIAN Cathy! They are coming again. 
Over. 
Help. 
Help. 
On Bridge. 
He then fumbles the CB and it drops to the floor of the cab. 
He looks up into the mirrors again and sees that they are still coming for him. 
The camera now comes in tight on his face and he pauses for a long second, and he then makes his decision. 
He reaches under his seat and takes out a handgun. 
He doesn't really seem to know what he is doing with it. 
But he opens the door of the truck and gets out. 
He aims the gun at LOUIS SERVIDIO walking towards him. 
LOUIS SERVIDIO sees him and is very surprised and stops. 
LOUIS SERVIDIO Whoa, whoa, whoa! Take it easy there. 75 He glances over at THUG #2. 
JULIAN Get the fuck away from me! LOUIS SERVIDIO Okay, man. 
People in the cars behind the truck are starting to honk. 
Then LOUIS SERVIDIO gives a nod signal to THUG #2 who is on the other side of the truck, and JULIAN'S gun fires by mistake. 
It totally misses THUG #2. 
He jumps out of the way and is hiding behind the wheel. 
LOUIS SERVIDIO (CONT'D) Watch it now, man. 
You're going to hurt someone. 
JULIAN is now in a total state of panic. 
He is hiding back in front of the truck. 
The three men are basically doing a slow- motion, very stressful hide-and-seek around the truck. 
The two THUGS now have their guns out. 
The honking has now reached a total insane level as traffic is backing up. 
Then THUG #2 makes one last play to take the truck. 
He tries to climb into the cab and JULIAN goes into a rage. 
He quickly fires three shots, missing THUG #2 with each one, but that forces LOUIS SERVIDIO to shoot two shots of his own at JULIAN to protect THUG #2. 
They miss as well, but one hits the main section of the tank and a small but steady stream of heating oil starts pouring out onto the roadway. 
Just then we hear sirens starting to come closer in the background. 
This adds a new element. 
LOUIS SERVIDIO (CONT'D) Where are you? 
THUG #2 Over here. 
LOUIS SERVIDIO Where is he? 
THUG #2 Over here. 
JULIAN is just trying to decide what to do next. 
The sirens are now getting much closer. 76 LOUIS SERVIDIO Get the car! THUG #2 takes off. 
This now leaves JULIAN and LOUIS SERVIDIO all alone with the police coming. 
As JULIAN is hiding, trying to figure out what to do next, LOUIS SERVIDIO goes running by him. 
As he does: LOUIS SERVIDIO (CONT'D) Run for it! JULIAN thinks for a second and then runs. 
EXT. 59TH STREET BRIDGE - DAY JULIAN runs all along the bridge and then sees LOUIS SERVIDIO run through a small door into the body of one of the four massive stone anchor structures that hold up the bridge. 
INT. THE 59TH STREET BRIDGE, SUPPORT COLUMN - DAY Once he is inside, there's another set of stairs. 
He locks the door behind him and starts racing down the stairs. 
As he heads down he hears someone just in front of him. 
He stops and looks down the center column of the stairs and looking up at him about three flights away is LOUIS SERVIDIO. LOUIS SERVIDIO Oh, there he is. 
Had to be the hero eh? 
JULIAN Fuck you. 
LOUIS SERVIDIO Couldn't just let us take the truck. 
JULIAN Fuck you! JULIAN is screaming in a fit of panic at this point. 
LOUIS SERVIDIO Hey man relax... calm down. 
Did they see you come in here? 
JULIAN can't stop breathing very heavy at this point. 
JULIAN I don't think so. 77 LOUIS SERVIDIO Did they or not? 
He thinks. 
JULIAN No. LOUIS SERVIDIO Alright, there's a door down here about four more flights. 
Don't go out there, that's the street. 
Go down about two more flights after that and you'll come out below the bridge. 
They won't be there. 
JULIAN Fuck you! LOUIS SERVIDIO You're welcome. 
Then LOUIS SERVIDIO's head disappears and we can hear his feet flying down the steps again. 
JULIAN thinks for a beat, then he starts off down the stairs again as well. 
The camera stays right where it was as JULIAN heads down out of sight. 
We just hear the sounds of his feet getting lower and lower. 
INT. BRIDGE GROUND FLOOR - DAY JULIAN comes to the first door and looks at it. 
We can hear sirens in the distance on the other side of the door. 
He keeps going. 
Down two more flights, just as he said, there is another doorway. 
JULIAN walks up to that door very carefully. 
He listens on the other side but doesn't hear anything but his own breath. 
INT. STAIR LANDING LOWEST LEVEL - DAY Then we hear the door back up top fly open. 
JULIAN then quietly opens the door in front of him and right in front of his face is a woman in full jogging clothes running by him. 
He looks around, and after a second to get himself orientated, we see he's on a riverfront esplanade where there are many people jogging and walking, enjoying the evening. 78 JULIAN looks at his hand and realizes he is still holding the gun out in the open. 
He puts it away and then looks up at the bridge that is hovering above him. 
He knows he left his life as he knew it up on that bridge. 
FADE TO BLACK. Over the black we begin to hear the rumble of a very large truck. 
It gets louder and louder. 
INT. OF A VERY LARGE EMPTY DUMPSTER - DAY We now see that SALES STUDENT ALEX is inside a massive, empty construction dumpster. 
And as he looks around, we realize it is on the back of a truck that is currently driving pretty fast. 
With each bump that the truck goes over the noise inside the dumpster is deafening. 
As the KID comes to his senses he tries to stand up. 
As he does, we see that the sides of the dumpster are at least eight feet tall and the interior is very slick without anything to grab or stand on. 
He is trapped. 
Just then the truck goes over another huge bump and comes to a stop. 
It idles for a minute then begins backing up. 
It stops. 
A warning, beeping alarm is heard, and finally one end of the dumpster begins rising. 
As it gets higher and higher our KID tries to hold himself back, but he begins to slide towards the low end. 
As he does he sees that the end that he is heading towards is on a hinge and it is starting to swing open. 
Finally the thing is at such an angle that he can't hold on any longer and he slides towards the opening. 
As he falls out he/we see that he's being dumped over the edge of a cliff of some sort. 
He falls probably 10-12 feet, into a pile of garbage. 
As he gathers himself and tries to stand, we see he is standing in a massive landfill. 
He looks around as the truck pulls away. 
He's left totally alone. 
INT. TENNIS COURT OF SUBURBAN MANSION - DAY ABEL is led by a MAID into an indoor tennis court. 
The house is massive and designed like an English Country Estate. 
As ABEL walks up we see PETER FORENTE on the court playing against an automatic tennis ball machine. 
He is in full tennis whites as he hammers the balls back at the machine. 
ABEL approaches the court and watches for a beat. 79 PETER FORENTE It's a pretty cool machine, isn't it? 
ABEL nods. 
PETER FORENTE (CONT'D) I was paying a guy five bucks an hour to do this with me last year. 
ABEL Peter. 
This causes PETER to look up and see the serious look on ABEL's face. 
He hits one last shot and walks a little closer to ABEL. The machine is still hitting balls behind PETER. PETER FORENTE Yes. 
ABEL I need to speak with you. 
PETER FORENTE I see that. 
PETER walks over to the machine and unplugs it. 
He points over towards the chairs courtside. 
He and ABEL sit down. 
ABEL This has gotten out of control... 
There was a guy with a gun at my house. 
ABEL lets this sit for a minute, and he is intently reading PETER's face. 
He hopes not, but he is judging to see if PETER had anything to do with all these attacks. 
PETER just looks back at him with a very strong poker face. 
ABEL (CONT'D) My wife and children were home at the time. 
PETER FORENTE Is everyone okay? 
ABEL Yes. 
I managed to chase him off. 
PETER FORENTE Well, I'm sorry, that must have been scary... what can I do. 80 ABEL I need to know who is doing this. 
PETER FORENTE Abel... 
ABEL It's one thing to come after my trucks and drivers... and to steal from me... but this... it's different. 
PETER FORENTE Yes. 
ABEL Have you ever dealt with anything like this? 
PETER FORENTE Have you met my father? 
They both smile. 
His father is an old-school gangster. 
PETER FORENTE (CONT'D) A bunch of thugs invaded our home when I was a baby... 
My mother was there with us... 
My brother remembers it. 
Nothing happened. 
They were trying to scare my father. 
They ended up just leaving and we never found out who it was. 
But after that we moved to a fortress just like this. 
And those guys who let you in. 
They are here to shoot anyone who isn't invited. 
ABEL I refuse to live my life that way. 
I won't do it... 
I am going to ask for a meeting. 
They both look out and think it through a bit. 
PETER FORENTE Who? 
ABEL Anyone with more than 20k of storage. 
Can I count on you being there? 
PETER looks away for a long beat. 81 PETER FORENTE Yes... 
When are you closing on the terminal? 
ABEL Monday. 
PETER FORENTE Congratulations. 
ABEL Hold that... it's not done yet... you may be hearing from me. (Trailed by an awkward laugh.) PETER FORENTE Well, good luck. 
ABEL stands up ready to go. 
ABEL Thank you for seeing me. 
I want more than this... 
PETER FORENTE I know you do. 
My father is in jail... as you know. 
And I have always wanted to conduct myself differently than he did. 
ABEL And you have. 
PETER FORENTE Almost exclusively, yes. 
But I know why he did what he did. 
Because at the time it's easier. 
ABEL But it's not. 
PETER FORENTE Yes it is. 
You are a good man. 
I will see what I can find out. 
This isn't good for any of us. 
ABEL Thank you. 82 EXT. PETER FORENTE'S DRIVEWAY - DAY ABEL is walking across the beautifully-manicured driveway, and as he gets nearer to his car he starts to hear the mayhem that is coming from the CB radio in the front seat. 
As he gets closer he gets more and more details. 
RADIO DISPATCHER V.O. 
Where is the truck now? 
RESPONDING DRIVER V.O. 
It's still on the bridge. 
RADIO DISPATCHER V.O. 
Is it still leaking oil? 
RESPONDING DRIVER V.O. 
No. They have stopped the leak. 
RADIO DISPATCHER V.O. 
Did it reach the river? 
RESPONDING DRIVER V.O. 
Some did. 
RADIO DISPATCHER V.O. 
How many shots were fired? 
ABEL now slams open the door and gets into the driver side and picks up the microphone. 
ABEL Joanne it's me. 
What are you talking about... what shots? 
The camera now comes around to the outside of the car looking back at ABEL through the windshield. 
The mansion is looming in the background. 
We see ABEL'S face react as he hears the news of the incident on the bridge. 
The camera pulls back as ABEL'S face goes totally cold. 
INT. COURT ROOM - DAY ABEL walks into an almost empty courtroom. 
LAWRENCE is packing up his things at the front of the room. 
They catch each others eye. 
ABEL makes his way forward as everyone else leaves. 
They look at each other for a beat. 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE I heard. 83 ABEL I need to make sure you know that we had nothing to do with this. 
It's not the way I do business. 
In fact I have been warning my men against doing this sort of thing. 
It is terrible for me. 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE It's not good... for either of us. 
ABEL Yes. 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE In my job we use whatever leverage we can gain, as I'm sure you do in your business. 
It's an ongoing investigation, and it will be just one piece of many. 
So while I appreciate you coming here... 
I have nothing I can tell you. 
LAWRENCE looks around the room thinking while ABEL says nothing, just waiting. 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE (CONT'D) What a fucking mess this place is... 
Do you know where he is? 
ABEL No... but I'll find him. 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE You should. 
And when you do, bring him to us. 
A situation like this, happening in such a dangerous and public way, within an industry I'm charged with cleaning up. 
It's very bad for me... professionally speaking. 
They look at each other one last time. 
ABEL gets the message. 
EXT. SMALL QUIET SIDE STREET, QUEENS - DAY SALES STUDENT ALEX is walking down the street looking terrible. 
His clothes are ruined by garbage, and he is scared. 
As he approaches his car his face drops. 
The car has a two-by-four slammed through the shattered windshield. 84 He stops dead in his tracks and then carefully looks around and scans the street looking for anything. 
It is eerily empty. 
EXT. OUTER GATE, STANDARD HEATING OIL YARD - DAY ABEL pulls up in his car and the gate starts to open. 
As it does we see ARTHUR LEWIS standing waiting next to his car. 
ABEL pulls in next to him and gets out. 
There is an overriding, almost unsettling calm to this conversation. 
ARTHUR LEWIS Abel. 
ABEL Arthur. 
ARTHUR LEWIS I wanted to come and talk to you in person... 
We aren't going to be able to show up for you on Monday. 
We can't do the loan. 
ABEL I... 
ARTHUR LEWIS I wanted to let you know as soon as possible so that you could try to put something else together. 
ABEL Thank you for coming... 
This is not right. 
ARTHUR LEWIS I know. 
ABEL What can I do? 
ARTHUR LEWIS Nothing... 
The loan review committee met this afternoon and won't meet again for two weeks. 
ABEL And you are aware of the position this is putting me in? 
ARTHUR LEWIS I am. 85 ABEL I paid off my first loan to you eleven years ago. 
ARTHUR LEWIS I know. 
ABEL Do you remember the term on that loan? 
ARTHUR LEWIS I don't. 
ABEL I had seven years to pay you back. 
They both nod knowing what's coming next. 
ABEL (CONT'D) Do you know how long it took me to pay you off? 
ARTHUR LEWIS Seven months? 
ABEL Six and a half. 
ARTHUR LEWIS I'm sorry. 
ABEL I put 40 percent down as a deposit on this. 
It's all we had. 
ARTHUR LEWIS You now have three separate serious pending legal cases against you. 
One with sixteen counts of misconduct ranging from fraud to tax evasion. 
And then in the middle of our meeting today I get a report saying you had armed your entire fleet of drivers which led to a shoot-out on the 59th Street Bridge. 
ABEL None of it is true. 
ARTHUR LEWIS That may be. 86 ABEL May? 
They look at each other. 
ARTHUR LEWIS It doesn't matter. 
ABEL It does matter, that you know we didn't do this. 
ARTHUR LEWIS I do... 
I do. 
But it doesn't matter, I can't do anything. 
I'm sorry. 
ABEL's demeanor shifts. 
ABEL I'll find it. 
ARTHUR LEWIS I know you will. 
The banker gets into his car and backs out. 
The gate opens and he drives out. 
Just as it is about to close it starts opening again. 
SALES STUDENT ALEX drives in with his car trashed. 
He pulls up and gets out of the car looking at ABEL. He knows what has happened and is crushed. 
Neither of them say a word, finally ABEL gives the kid a cautious but meaningful hug around the shoulder and leads him inside. 
INT. ABEL AND ANNA'S LIVING ROOM - THAT NIGHT ABEL walks into the room and ANNA is sitting at the large dining table smoking a cigarette inside. 
She has been crying. 
ANNA It's horrible. 
ABEL Yes. 
ANNA Where is he? 
ABEL We're looking for him. 
ANNA And they haven't gotten the other guys? 87 ABEL Of course not. 
ANNA Are you okay? 
ABEL No... 
I'm not... 
They're out. 
This gets her attention. 
ANNA Who? 
ABEL The bank. 
With that ABEL walks out of the room and heads up the stairs to his bedroom. 
When he's halfway up the stairs she stops him. 
ANNA So what does that mean? 
ABEL It means we need to find the money somewhere else. 
ANNA We have two days! ABEL I'll figure it out. 
INT. ANNA'S CAR, WESTCHESTER SCENIC HIGHWAY - DAY ABEL is driving ANNA'S car towards the city. 
ANNA is in the passenger seat and the three DAUGHTERS are in the back. 
ANNA and ABEL do not look any better. 
In fact there is now a tinge of anger mixed into the sadness. 
The DAUGHTERS are arguing about who's taking up too much room in the back seat. 
DAUGHTERS Move. 
ANNA Quiet. 
DAUGHTERS You move. 88 ANNA turns and snaps at them a bit. 
ANNA Stop. 
I've told you guys not to push it this morning, this is not the morning to be doing this... but since the second you all woke up. 
It's this, it's that. 
Just stop. 
The world does not revolve around you! This shuts them up for a beat. 
ABEL is seething. 
But then ELIZABETH (middle) nudges ANNIE (oldest) so she gives CATHERINE (youngest) a good hit. 
ANNA sees it and freaks. 
ANNA (CONT'D) That's it Annie we've told you... 
Before ANNA can get the full sentence out ABEL suddenly pulls the car off the side of the highway into the grass. 
Everyone in the car is taken aback. 
The road is a smaller scenic highway not some eight lane affair but this whole sequence still plays out with the menacing roar of the cars going by right next to them. 
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY ABEL gets out of the car and slams the door. 
He walks around the back of the car as the cars fly by them on the highway. 
He goes around to his oldest daughter's door and pulls ANNIE from the car. 
They stand behind the car and go at it with the traffic flying by. 
ABEL is louder than he has been in the entire film. 
He is losing it from all the pressure but his daughter bears the brunt. 
ABEL You are thirteen years old. 
What are you doing? 
Your mother asks you an hour ago to help her get out of the house smoothly and you are acting like an... 
ANNIE Oh fuck you! ABEL What? 
What? 
What are you talking about? 
ABEL is looking around for someone to help him and witness this. 
He then switches, he has had enough and gets right up in her face. 89 ABEL (CONT'D) I'm not sure who the hell you think you are, but you don't talk to me that way... 
You are in serious danger of becoming a rich little spoiled brat and I can tell you from experience there is nothing worse in the world than a rich little girl who thinks the whole world revolves around her. 
ANNIE is yelling back over the traffic. 
ANNIE The world revolves around me? 
Me! What about her? 
And what about you? 
You're both so totally obsessed with your stupid business. 
You walk around like you are saving the world but what are you doing... nothing! This stings. 
He now changes his tone to a quiet low roar. 
But he can't keep quiet and by the end of the line he is yelling again. 
ABEL First off I don't walk around like I am saving anything. 
I chose this business because I looked at the world and said `What's the last bill people stop paying every month when they are low on cash?' `Cause that's a business I want to be in. `Cause failure wasn't much of an option for me. 
I lived in reality... not whatever this world is you are living in. 
And we help people stay warm... which isn't all that bad. (now he is yelling again) Maybe you've got grander ambitions but for now this is how you eat, sleep, and get all dressed up... 
So you better shape the fuck up and NEVER speak to me like this again! ANNA Stop!! They both look over and ANNA is standing there. 
A calmness suddenly falls down on all of them. 90 INT. ANNA'S CAR ON HIGHWAY - DAY All five of them are sitting in the car, sadness prevails. 
INT. ANNA MORALES' LIBRARY - NIGHT The camera moves slowly across a dark hallway. 
We hear the sounds of a manual adding machine grinding away. 
As we come through the doorway we see ANNA MORALES sitting at her desk in a pool of light from the desk lamp. 
She is deep in it crunching numbers. 
Finally ABEL walks into the doorway, he looks exhausted. 
ABEL Hey. 
She looks up with a small but sweet smile. 
ANNA Hi. ABEL How's it coming? 
ANNA I've made it to 1975. 
ABEL That was a good year. 
ANNA gives a slight look that the numbers may not totally support that claim. 
ABEL (CONT'D) Well it was for me...how is it? 
ANNA I'm not sure yet... but it's not as bad as they are saying it is... 
Turns out I kinda knew what I was doing. 
They give each other a slight smile. 
ANNA (CONT'D) How'd you do? 
ABEL I got us a three more days... and one piece... from Saul. 
But we're still about a million short. 
They look at each other with concern. 91 ANNA You're going to see your little brother? 
ABEL First thing. 
ANNA And Peter? 
ABEL Probably. 
As they look at each other ABEL ANNA This is all worth it. 
He pauses just long enough to think. 
ABEL Of course. 
A sense of caring and resolve comes over them. 
At least now they know what needs to be done. 
ABEL (CONT'D) You should get to bed. 
ANNA I'll be up. 
ABEL I love you. 
ANNA I love you too. 
ABEL turns to go upstairs as ANNA starts in again with the machine. 
INT. HALLWAY, OUTSIDE OF JULIAN'S APARTMENT - DAY ANDREW stands in the hallway about to knock, but he waits for a beat. 
He knocks. 
The door opens to a young woman, presumably JULIAN'S wife, LUISA. ANDREW WALSH Is Julian here? 92 LUISA No. ANDREW WALSH Abel would like to speak with him. 
To help him. 
LUISA I will tell him. 
JULIAN steps into the frame from behind her. 
EXT./INT. LARGE LATE-MODEL AMERICAN CAR, PARKED - DAY A DRIVER is sitting in the driver's seat. 
ANDREW walks up and gets in the front seat. 
JULIAN gets into the back and looks over at ABEL who is sitting next to him. 
They drive off and nobody says a word for a very, very long time. 
EXT. EMPTY PARKING LOT - DAY The car finally pulls into a large empty parking lot. 
For a couple beats JULIAN has a look on his face that he may be getting rubbed out. 
Then off in the distance we see two cop cars. 
The car pulls up to them and stops. 
ABEL and the DRIVER get out of the car without a word, but ANDREW stays and turns around and now gives him a total debrief. 
JULIAN He's turning me in? 
ANDREW looks at him without much remorse. 
ANDREW WALSH Of course we are turning you in. 
You have put everything that man has worked for for the last 20 years at risk. 
If it was up to me we would be dealing with this in a very different way. 
JULIAN But I know things... 
This causes ANDREW to turn quickly back to him with as sharp a look as he has. 
ANDREW WALSH Really? 93 JULIAN Yes. 
ANDREW WALSH And what things do you know? 
JULIAN looks back at him. 
ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D) I strongly suggest you think that through before you answer it. 
Because even if you did, what does it do for you? 
Nothing. 
There is nothing there for you to gain. 
Nothing. 
JULIAN I'm sorry. 
ANDREW WALSH I am too. 
ANDREW now changes his tone. 
ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D) They say they have you firing four shots, is that right? 
JULIAN I don't know. 
ANDREW WALSH Where's the gun? 
JULIAN stutters for a moment, then. 
JULIAN I threw it in the river. 
ANDREW WALSH Good. 
Your background check with us says you have never been arrested, is that true? 
JULIAN Why is this putting everything at risk? 
ANDREW WALSH Have you ever been arrested? 
JULIAN No. 94 ANDREW WALSH Because no bank will touch us right now. 
So we can't close on the new property. 
And he's going to lose everything on his deposit. 
This sits heavily on JULIAN. ANDREW hands him a card. 
ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D) This is a lawyer who will meet you when they bring you to the station. 
You no longer work for us. 
You've been fired. 
But Abel wants to pay for the lawyer. 
So... this guy should be able to help you. 
Good luck. 
With that JULIAN gets out of the car. 
ABEL is standing there. 
They meet. 
JULIAN I'm sorry. 
ABEL I know. 
JULIAN I was scared. 
ABEL I know. 
JULIAN Aren't you scared? 
ABEL Sometimes. 
JULIAN What do you do? 
ABEL thinks this through long and hard. 
ABEL I have always been much more scared of failure than anything else. 
JULIAN I... 
ABEL It wasn't always like this. 95 JULIAN Are you ruined? 
ABEL Not today... but by the end of the week... maybe. 
JULIAN I'm sorry. 
ABEL Good... 
JULIAN No... 
I am not strong. 
ABEL That does not have to be true. 
JULIAN Trust me... 
I am not... 
I'm sorry. 
With that JULIAN walks across the parking lot towards the POLICE to turn himself in. 
ANDREW walks up behind ABEL and stands there looking. 
ANDREW WALSH I'm late. 
I will meet you at four. 
ABEL I'm gonna try to get us a little more time. 
The three COPS are standing waiting as JULIAN walks towards them. 
ABEL turns around, facing the camera, and closes his eyes in sadness. 
With ABEL in the foreground we see JULIAN make it halfway to the COPS, then he stops. 
COP 1 Hey. 
ABEL'S face tells us he knows what is coming. 
JULIAN sets off running. 
Before the COPS can get close to him he is off. 
ABEL turns and sees what is happening. 
He does not follow chase. 
His head just drops. 96 EXT. VARIOUS 1980'S URBAN DECAY LANDSCAPES We are now with JULIAN again, running. 
But as this chase continues we see his face turn from fear, to desperation, to a creeping sense of evil. 
He does not know how it has come to this, but as he jumps down from fences and runs across deserted lots we see that his weakness is turning. 
As he runs through some of the most bombed-out, destroyed sections of Queens, he just never stops. 
With each step his fear turns to... anger. 
EXT. BLOWN-OUT BUILDING He stops, collapses, and hides behind a blown-out building wall just as a COP CAR drives by. 
He starts to almost cry, but then it again becomes something else. 
His survival instinct is taking over and we are not sure what will become of it. 
Anger. 
INT. OLDEST HASIDIC BUSINESSMAN'S LIVING ROOM - DAY ABEL sits across from the oldest Hasidic member of the family, JOSEPH, from the first scene. 
ABEL Thank you for seeing me. 
JOSEPH Of course. 
ABEL I need more time. 
JOSEPH Of course you do. 
ABEL I know our agreement doesn't allow for that. 
But... 
I need more time. 
JOSEPH Why? 
This takes ABEL back a bit. 
ABEL Thank you for asking. 
Many, many reasons. 97 JOSEPH It's a difficult time to do business. 
ABEL Yes... it is. 
JOSEPH I'll give you three more days. 
Then it's over. 
ABEL Thank you. 
INT. ASSISTANT DA'S OFFICE - DAY ANDREW sits across from LAWRENCE and DEPUTY LANGE. They wait while LAWRENCE writes something down on a pad in front of him. 
He finishes. 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE So. I should start by thanking you for your assistance in... in attempting to bring in your driver? 
ANDREW WALSH We didn't think he'd react that way. 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE Yes... 
Well, the officers there didn't set it up very well on their end either. 
ANDREW WALSH I'm sorry. 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE We are looking for him. 
ANDREW WALSH So are we... it's very sad. 
He was very close to Abel. 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE I understand. 
Well... 
Ms. Lange. 
DEPUTY LANGE It has been brought to our attention that it might be beneficial on your end to resolve this issue in a time sensitive way. 98 ANDREW WALSH Possibly. 
DEPUTY LANGE So we have prepared an offer for you to review. 
They slide the offer across the table. 
ANDREW opens it and gives it a once over. 
ANDREW WALSH I'll show this to them. 
He'll never go for it, but it's a start. 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE This could get a lot worse for you all. 
ANDREW WALSH I know... 
I will present it to him. 
ANDREW gets up and prepares to leave. 
LAWRENCE stands with him and walks him out into the hallway. 
ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D) Thank you. 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE And Andrew, one other thing. 
He turns. 
They are now alone in the hallway. 
INT. IMPOSSIBLY LONG HALLWAY - DAY A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE I need this to stop. 
ANDREW WALSH You need what to stop? 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE This fucking bullshit with the open warfare. 
I won't put up with it. 
It's starting to be a real problem. 
ANDREW WALSH Starting to be? 
No shit. 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE Not for you... but for me. 
This lingers for a beat as the meaning sinks in. 99 A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE (CONT'D) I need the driver. 
ANDREW WALSH I understand. 
The kid went out and got his own gun. 
This was not us. 
No matter what you think of him, Abel doesn't work this way. 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE I really could give a fuck, but you need to get your man to talk to these people, give in, stop doing whatever you are doing to bring this shit on you. 
It needs to stop. 
ANDREW WALSH He wants to talk to them. 
We've been trying to set up a meeting. 
O'Leary hasn't been able to get it done. 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE I'll talk to him. 
ANDREW gives him a look. 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE (CONT'D) He's an old friend... and get that kid back in here. 
I'm up in it a little bit here and I need something. 
LAWRENCE turns and walks back into his office. 
ANDREW walks down the hallway all alone then stops. 
He reaches into his briefcase and takes out the offer. 
He looks it over again. 
Then he looks towards the ground and almost looks like he might cry. 
There is a distinct sense of responsibility for the situation that ABEL finds himself in that is starting to bring ANDREW to the edge. 
EXT. CEMETERY - DAY ABEL is waiting standing next to his car. 
ANDREW comes driving into the lot next to him and gets out. 
ABEL I talked to the Hasid, I got us three days. 
ANDREW nods. 100 ANDREW WALSH Is that enough? 
ABEL I don't know. 
ANDREW WALSH Well here it is. 
It's just a first pass. 
He hands him the plea deal from the DA. ABEL looks it over but shows almost no emotion. 
Then. 
ABEL Felons can't vote. 
This takes ANDREW back. 
ANDREW WALSH I'm sorry? 
ABEL This plea has me... 
ANDREW WALSH I know. 
It's just a first offer. 
ABEL I would never take this. 
ANDREW WALSH I know. 
ABEL looks off and resets. 
ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D) He's going to get us the meeting. 
ABEL Who? 
ANDREW WALSH Lawrence, he's tight with O'Leary. 
ABEL Of course he is. 
ANDREW WALSH Does Julian have anything? 
ABEL gives him a look? 
ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D) Anything on us? 101 ABEL All the drivers could have us on scales. 
Why? 
ANDREW WALSH If we are cutting deals, we can't have anything new come up at the last minute. 
ABEL He would never do that. 
ANDREW WALSH We need to find him... 
Lawrence needs him. 
INT. JULIAN'S APARTMENT - DAY ABEL stands outside the door for a very long beat then finally knocks. 
JULIAN'S wife, LUISA, opens the door. 
She gestures him in. 
He enters the apartment and looks around. 
She gestures for him to sit. 
He chooses a seat right across from her. 
He stares at her for a beat. 
Then for the first time we hear him speak Spanish. (This whole conversation is in Spanish) ABEL Thank you for letting me in. 
LUISA Of course. 
ABEL moves his chair closer. 
It's meant to be, and is a bit threatening. 
ABEL Have you seen Julian? 
LUISA No. ABEL questions her with a look. 
ABEL We need to find him. 
LUISA I know. 
ABEL I am worried about him. 102 LUISA So am I. 
ABEL You know we were going to support him. 
I do not know why he ran. 
LUISA He was scared. 
ABEL shakes his head. 
ABEL I know. 
LUISA He has always wanted to make you proud. 
You know that right? 
ABEL Yes. 
Well this time that hasn't worked out. 
LUISA No... 
How did you do it? 
ABEL Do what? 
LUISA This. 
She motions towards his suit. 
LUISA (CONT'D) Success... that's all he wanted. 
ABEL I know. 
It makes me very sad, because he is a very talented young man. 
But there are some decisions that you cannot come back from. 
I need to know where he is. 
And I need him to turn himself in. 
His actions are hurting me and my business. 
And I refuse to let other people's weaknesses hurt me. 
I don't know how it has come to this, but it has. 
If he does the right thing I will help to take care of his responsibilities. 
You and your family. 
When you see him. 
Tell him this. 
Please. 103 LUISA I will. 
ABEL gets up and starts looking around the apartment a bit. 
He walks over to a small cabinet. 
ABEL Does he have any money? 
LUISA I'm sorry? 
ABEL Money? 
Has he taken money out of your bank account? 
LUISA I don't know? 
ABEL You need to start looking into these things. 
It is very important that we find him safely. 
And with that JULIAN comes smashing out of the tiny cabinet where he was hiding and knocks over ABEL. JULIAN runs to the front door with ABEL chasing him. 
He starts flying down the stairs at top panic speed. 
ABEL follows him down half the flight and realizes it is useless. 
ABEL (CONT'D) (IN ENGLISH) Stop! Stop running away! Andrew! He's coming your way! This is screamed at the top of his lungs but JULIAN never stops. 
We just hear his footsteps going down. 
INT. BOTTOM/TOP OF JULIAN'S STAIRWELL - DAY ANDREW comes up the first few steps and we see him waiting for JULIAN. ABEL then looks back up the half flight of stairs and sees LUISA standing there in the hall. 
He walks back up to her in an aggressive way. 
We fear for her. 
He gets right up in her face but does not touch her. 
ABEL (in Spanish again) I understand why you lied, but it is not smart. (MORE) 104 ABEL (CONT'D) There are other people looking for him. 
I am as good an option as he has. 
Know this. 
And with that he heads down the stairs. 
EXT. BACK OF JULIAN'S APARTMENT/PARK STAIRS - DAY JULIAN is running out the back of the building and down a huge exterior staircase that is in a small park. 
He is about half way down when ANDREW gets to the top. 
ANDREW screams. 
ANDREW WALSH Fuck You! You better run! INT. A SLIGHTLY RUNDOWN CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY ABEL sits across a table from an OLD MAN in his late-70's who seems to have early-onset dementia and a WOMAN in her early- 20's, LORRAINE LEFKOWITZ who's overweight, but confident. 
The old man, SAUL LEFKOWITZ, just sits there through the scene. 
ABEL Thank you both for agreeing to meet with me. 
LORRAINE LEFKOWITZ Of course. 
ABEL I think we have met before but I didn't realize you were Saul's Granddaughter. 
LORRAINE LEFKOWITZ I am. 
ABEL I'm sorry to ask but how old are you? 
LORRAINE LEFKOWITZ I'm 23. 
ABEL Oh. LORRAINE LEFKOWITZ My Grandfather didn't trust any of his children to run the business. 105 ABEL Yes. 
LORRAINE LEFKOWITZ I know that you tried to buy the company from my Grandfather several times. 
ABEL Yes. 
LORRAINE LEFKOWITZ His goal was to stay healthy long enough to be able to give the company to me. 
Which he thankfully did. 
They both give a slight smile. 
LORRAINE LEFKOWITZ (CONT'D) So, while I appreciate your visit we are still not for sale. 
ABEL I understand. 
And I hope that your Grandfather was able to communicate to you how much I have always respected him. 
And it was only out of respect for the business he had built, and because I knew of his reservations and feelings about your uncles and your father that I made those offers. 
LORAINE LEFKOWITZ I understand. 
ABEL But, I am not here to offer to buy your company. 
LORAINE LEFKOWITZ Oh. ABEL As I'm sure you will soon learn some years are good... others not so. 
I am in contract with a significant hard deposit at risk to purchase the old Bayfront terminal. 
LORAINE LEFKOWITZ I see. 106 ABEL And due to circumstances beyond my control my bank has left me at the altar. 
LORAINE LEFKOWITZ I'm sorry. 
ABEL So, I am here, hat in hand, looking for a loan. 
I certainly expect the terms to be in your favor as I could not be at a weaker place. 
But, if your Grandfather trusted you with his company, I would be willing to trust you as my lien holder. 
They all stare at each other. 
Then the old man shifts in his chair. 
SAUL LEFKOWITZ How much? 
ABEL I need $500,000. 
SAUL and his GRANDDAUGHTER look at each other. 
They say nothing but clearly know each other well. 
LORAINE LEFKOWITZ Would you give us a minute. 
ABEL Of course. 
INT. WAITING AREA, OUTSIDE THE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY ABEL sits in a simple chair outside the conference room looking around at an office that is similar to his. 
A phone on the receptionist's desk rings. 
She picks it up. 
LEFKOWITZ RECEPTIONIST You can go back in. 
INT. SLIGHTLY RUNDOWN CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY ABEL sits down. 
LORAINE LEFKOWITZ We can offer you the 500k at 20 percent for a year. (MORE) 107 LORAINE LEFKOWITZ (CONT'D) And we would need a five-year straight wholesale holding agreement for 250,000 gallons a year at your new facility. 
This hits ABEL hard. 
ABEL Okay. 
Thank you. 
They shake hands and then he hugs the old man good bye. 
LORAINE LEFKOWITZ So, I guess we will see you tonight? 
ABEL Tonight? 
Oh yes, of course. 
INT. LONG ISLAND ITALIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT A HOSTESS leads ABEL and ANDREW through the whole main dining room and through a side kitchen. 
INT. ITALIAN RESTAURANT - PRIVATE DINING ROOM - NIGHT Finally they come through a door and into a small back private dining room where fifteen of their COMPETITORS, a couple of whom we have already met (Including LORRAINE and SAUL LEFKOWITZ, and ARNOLD KLINE), are sitting around the table meeting and waiting for them to arrive. 
The whole room looks up at them. 
O'LEARY is at the head of the table at the far end of the room. 
He stands up to greet them and then so does the rest of the room. 
BILL O'LEARY Abel. 
Please sit. 
Finally everyone settles and the room falls quiet. 
BILL O'LEARY (CONT'D) Abel. 
Now the room is silent as it waits and waits for him to speak. 
ABEL Stop... 108 ABEL is deadly serious. 
He just lets this sit and looks around the room at each person. 
They all seem to be waiting for him to continue. 
But he doesn't. 
He just lets this sit. 
Finally PETER FORENTE, who is across from ABEL, shifts in his seat and leans forward. 
PETER FORENTE Um... 
Abel... we had a chance to meet for a little bit before you got here and... of course everyone in this room is fully capable of lying to their own mothers on their deathbeds, but... the conclusion we have come to... 
I should say we are fairly convinced after a very frank conversation... that these guys who are doing this... that they don't actually work for anyone in this room. 
As you know there are many other smaller providers in the area that might be responsible who are not here tonight. 
This sits in the room for a long beat. 
Everyone then shifts back their attention to ABEL waiting for his response. 
Finally. 
ABEL Peter... thank you... 
That may be true. 
He stops and thinks about how to continue. 
ABEL (CONT'D) But over the last six months 110,000 gallons of fuel has been stolen from my family and I. 
Now the reason we asked Bill to get you all here is because the people in this room are the only people within two hundred miles of here who have the ability to purchase and store that kind of quantity. 
So... no matter what bullshit you have been telling each other one of you... or two... or three... has been allowing this to happen by buying this from these cowards or worse yet hiring these guys just to do it. 
And profiting from it. 
So what I am saying is... 
Stop! Now. 
Have some pride in what you do and stop. 109 INT. ANNA MORALES' LIBRARY - NIGHT The camera moves slowly across a dark hallway. 
We hear the sounds of a manual adding machine grinding away. 
As we come through the doorway we see ANNA MORALES sitting at her desk in a pool of light from the desk lamp. 
She is deep in it crunching numbers. 
Finally ABEL walks into the doorway, he looks exhausted. 
ABEL Hey. 
She looks up with a small but sweet smile. 
ANNA Hi. ABEL How's it coming? 
ANNA I've made it to 1975. 
ABEL That was a good year. 
ANNA gives a slight look that the numbers may not totally support that claim. 
ABEL (CONT'D) Well it was for me...how is it? 
ANNA I'm not sure yet... but it's not as bad as they are saying it is... 
I guess I knew what I was doing. 
They give each other a slight smile. 
ANNA (CONT'D) How'd you do? 
ABEL I got us a three more days... and one piece... from Saul. 
But we're still about a million short. 
Concern and exhaustion creep onto Abel's face. 
ANNA You're going to see your little brother? 110 ABEL First thing. 
ANNA And Peter? 
ABEL Probably. 
Abel is now sitting down on the chair. 
ABEL (CONT'D) How are the girls? 
I feel like I haven't seen them in days. 
ANNA They're fine. 
ANNA gets up from her desk and comes over to him. 
ANNA (CONT'D) This is all worth it. 
He pauses just long enough to think. 
ABEL Of course. 
ANNA Look at us...it is. 
ABEL I know. 
A sense of caring and resolve comes over them. 
At least now they know what needs to be done. 
ABEL (CONT'D) We should get to bed. 
ANNA I'll be up. 
ABEL I love you. 
ANNA I love you too. 
ABEL turns to go upstairs as ANNA starts in again with the machine. 111 INT. ABEL'S CAR - DRIVING - DAY ABEL is driving towards the office and is listening to the idle chatter on the radio between the dispatcher and the drivers who are out. 
They are underneath the Brooklyn Queens Expressway in stop and go traffic. 
Suddenly a panic stricken VOICE blasts through on the radio. 
SENIOR DRIVER EDDY V.O. 
Motherfuckers! RADIO DISPATCHER V.O. 
Who's that? 
SENIOR DRIVER EDDY V.O. 
It's 17. 
Two guys are coming at me. 
RADIO DISPATCHER V.O. 
Where are you? 
We now hear the driver yell at the TWO GUYS coming at him. 
SENIOR DRIVER EDDY V.O. 
Fuck you! RADIO DISPATCHER V.O. 
Where are you! SENIOR DRIVER EDDY V.O. 
Hall Street and Flushing Ave. 
I'm out of... 
RADIO DISPATCHER V.O. 
Eddy? 
Eddy? 
ABEL looks up at the street where they are and realizes this is going down right down the street from them. 
He's had enough. 
He pulls across the intersection and heads down a street. 
He comes to the next intersection and right in front of him the truck comes flying by. 
He looks to his right and sees EDDY standing at the side of the road. 
But he wants to end this. 
So he pulls out and starts following the truck leaving EDDY behind. 
ABEL follows the truck for several blocks through the industrial neighborhood. 
He is tempted to pull up alongside of it to see who is driving but doesn't. 
He continues to follow him. 112 They get to a light and the truck makes a right hand turn and, as they are turning, LOUIS SERVIDIO who is sitting in the passenger seat looks behind him and sees that ABEL is following him. 
It now turns into a high speed chase as the driver steps on it. 
They race down a ramp into a railyard. 
ABEL chases the truck as it crosses the tracks and heads towards an abandoned tunnel. 
The truck races into the tunnel and ABEL follows. 
The truck is throwing up a dust storm and ABEL has a difficult time seeing where he is going but he keeps up. 
The roadway is very bumpy and both the truck and ABEL'S car are thrown around and the truck almost hits the sides of the tunnel. 
The light at the end of the tunnel starts to appear through the dust but we can't see the truck. 
As ABEL comes into the light he has to SLAM on his brakes because the TRUCK has flipped over in front of him. 
As he gets out of his car he sees LOUIS SERVIDIO jumping down from the overturned cab and run off into the train yard. 
ABEL looks at the crushed cab of the truck and sees the DRIVER has been killed. 
There is a gun sitting on the dash of the truck and ABEL looks and thinks. 
He then picks up the gun and chases after LOUIS SERVIDIO. In the distance he sees LOUIS SERVIDIO leave the yard and head up into an elevated subway station. 
EXT. SUBWAY STATION - DAY ABEL runs up the stairs of the station and hops onto a leaving train just as the doors shut. 
ABEL looks around. 
There are three people in his car. 
It is covered in graffiti. 
He starts making his way down to the end of the train where the guy is. 
He looks into the last car and sees LOUIS SERVIDIO and just bull rushes him to the ground. 
He starts beating on him very, very badly with the pistol. 
All the rage comes out of him. 
He then aims the gun at LOUIS SERVIDIO. LOUIS SERVIDIO Please. 
Please. 
They stare at each other. 
ABEL Your friend is dead... who do you work for. 113 LOUIS SERVIDIO You know I could never tell you that. 
ABEL Stop... just stop. 
LOUIS SERVIDIO This was it anyway. 
Okay... 
Okay. 
ABEL looks right through him and then finally lowers the gun and releases his hands from around his jacket and he gets up and looks back at ABEL. LOUIS SERVIDIO (CONT'D) Thank you. 
LOUIS SERVIDIO then runs out of the car as the door opens. 
ABEL sits up and slows his breathing down. 
Finally he looks around the trashed car and sees that a woman has been in the car with them the whole time and she is just staring at him. 
INT. BROOKLYN BARBERSHOP - DAY ABEL walks into the shop and is a little put back together but is worse for the wear. 
ARNOLD KLINE is sitting in one of the chairs waiting. 
He turns to ABEL. ARNOLD KLINE Hey. 
ABEL Jimmy, can you give me a minute? 
Jimmy looks around then walks into the back. 
ARNOLD KLINE Abel, that was well said. 
ABEL Thank you. 
ARNOLD KLINE What can I do for you? 
ABEL I've just come to collect that check you owe me. 
This takes him back a step. 
ARNOLD KLINE What check is that? 114 ABEL The one for $213,000. 
ARNOLD KLINE I'm sorry? 
ABEL That's how much has been taken from me over the last six months. 
ARNOLD KLINE I had nothing to do with that. 
ABEL Your Far Rockaway facility bought a load of fuel last week off one of my stolen trucks. 
ARNOLD KLINE That's not possible. 
ABEL I was standing on top of one of my hi-jacked trucks a couple weeks ago thinking about the cowards who did this when I remembered I had bought the load of fuel off a friend's tanker straight from Texas. 
As I'm sure you know Texas #4 is marked. 
But that was just one load, so every truck that has left my lot for the last two weeks has been marked with dye that I've put in... 
And luckily four more of my trucks got jacked since.... 
My guess is there are at least 4600 gallons of marked fuel in your small tank right now. 
No answer. 
Finally. 
ARNOLD KLINE How much? 
ABEL I said...213,000. 
ARNOLD KLINE I'll need a day. 
ABEL Okay. 
ABEL gets ready to leave. 115 ARNOLD KLINE I've just been buying this stuff off these guys, it was only a couple loads, I don't know who they are. 
I would never do that. 
ABEL My goal was to have you out of business by the end of next year. 
And if you're this fucking desperate it doesn't seem like it will even take that long. 
He walks away. 
ARNOLD KLINE Abel, I wasn't the only person buying this shit. 
He turns. 
ABEL I don't care. 
ARNOLD KLINE It may ruin me. 
ABEL When you find out who else it was you can get them to pay you back the difference. 
Kinda makes you miss having your father around? 
But I need the whole lot tomorrow or the feds will be at your doorstep by noon. 
He leaves. 
EXT. UNIVERSITY ATHLETIC FIELD - DAY ABEL is sitting on a bleacher totally alone watching a prep school football practice. 
We stay with him as he sits quietly just watching. 
Eventually his 21-YEAR-OLD YOUNGER BROTHER, ELIAS, comes walking off the field over to him. 
PLAYERS start leaving the field. 
ABEL You look good out there. 
ELIAS I didn't know you were coming. 116 ABEL I didn't either... 
I didn't mean to take you away. 
ELIAS We're done. 
He sits down next to him. 
They both look out for a long, long beat. 
ELIAS (CONT'D) Thanks for coming. 
ABEL Of course. 
You've grown. 
ELIAS You saw me a month ago. 
ABEL I know... but you have. 
ABEL looks across as a small group of GIRLS FIELD HOCKEY PLAYERS walk across the field in front of them. 
They watch them pass and walk away. 
ABEL (CONT'D) The girls at this place... they are so beautiful? 
He looks over with a wry smile. 
ELIAS Yes. 
ABEL I don't know how you get anything done around here. 
ELIAS I don't. 
Slight smile at each other. 
ABEL I'm in a bit of a rough patch. 
ELIAS Yes... 
ABEL It happens. 117 ELIAS I know. 
ABEL Good... 
ABEL stands and looks around for a good bit. 
Then thinks about sitting down again. 
ABEL (CONT'D) That will be your burden... 
ELIAS What will? 
ABEL Not having had one. 
Then he sits. 
ABEL (CONT'D) I need your signature on this. 
ELIAS looks over. 
ELIAS What is it? 
ABEL I need to take out a short term mortgage on our apartment building. 
ELIAS That thing isn't worth more than 150 grand though? 
ABEL 210. 
ELIAS Since when do you need to be taking out sucker mortgages for 200 grand? 
ABEL I'm up against it a bit. 
It will be fine. 
They look at each other for a long beat. 
And then he signs it. 
ABEL (CONT'D) Thank you... 
It's good to see your face. 118 ELIAS I love you. 
ABEL I love you too. 
They hug and then ELIAS walks off. 
ABEL sits back down and just watches him walk away. 
INT. FORENTE TENNIS COURT - NIGHT ABEL walks into the darkened tennis court and looks around. 
We aren't sure what he is there for. 
On the other side of the court a light is on in a attached lounge. 
PETER comes into the light. 
PETER FORENTE Well here he is. 
The caped crusader. 
ABEL Yes. 
PETER FORENTE Come over. 
Are you alright? 
ABEL I am. 
PETER FORENTE Did they catch any of them? 
Sit. 
INT. TENNIS COURT LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS ABEL The one guy didn't make it out of the crash, and the other guy disappeared. 
PETER FORENTE That was very well said last night. 
ABEL Thank you. 
And thanks for seeing me. 
PETER FORENTE Of course. 
So what is it? 
ABEL I need a loan. 119 PETER'S face scrunches up like he tasted a lemon and he turns away for a beat. 
Then comes back. 
PETER FORENTE You don't want to do that. 
ABEL No shit... but I'm here. 
PETER FORENTE What are we talking about here. 
ABEL Six hundred thousand. 
PETER FORENTE Jesus. 
Abel, that's a problem. 
ABEL Yes... but if I don't get it... 
PETER FORENTE What's my collateral? 
ABEL The terminal. 
PETER FORENTE Yeah me and how many other people will be coming after it. 
No way. 
ABEL You'll get your money. 
PETER FORENTE Abel, you know I respect everything you've done. 
Because of it we haven't come down on you the way I should have for coming into my service area and poaching my customers. 
You're good at what you do, probably better than us, and I accept that. 
But this would be different. 
I don't want you to be in this position. 
We are not nice people to borrow three quarters of million dollars from. 
ABEL I know that. 
PETER FORENTE Let's sleep on this. 
Both of us. 120 INT. ABEL AND ANNA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT ABEL comes in as ANNA is sitting at the table smoking. 
He walks over and sits down at the table with her. 
She gives him a great sly smile. 
ANNA What a day. 
ABEL Yeah. 
ANNA Are you okay? 
ABEL Yes. 
ANNA Car chases? 
ABEL Yeah. 
ANNA Who knew? 
She gives him a loving look. 
ANNA (CONT'D) How was your brother? 
ABEL He seemed good... 
But the girls up at that place are... 
ANNA Stop. 
ABEL I can tell you the girls didn't look like that where I went to school... 
ANNA Enough. 
After a brief light moment the cloud comes back over him. 
ABEL How are we here? 121 ANNA It was a lot of things all at once. 
ABEL Yeah. 
ANNA How did it go? 
ABEL We can probably pull it off. 
Three different parties... it'll be a mess... and the terms... 
Peter suddenly showed me his true colors. 
He lets out a brutal sigh. 
ANNA I'm sorry. 
ABEL I spent my whole life trying not to become a gangster... 
ANNA I know. 
ABEL ...And now... on the biggest deal in my career they will all control me. 
He sits there for a long beat and then she comes and hands him a piece of paper with a series of numbers on it. 
He looks up at her. 
ABEL (CONT'D) What is this? 
ANNA It's a bank account. 
ABEL just waits for more but gets nothing. 
ABEL Whose? 
ANNA Ours. 
ABEL How much is in it? 122 ANNA A lot. 
ABEL What does that mean? 
ANNA It will help. 
You could replace Peter's money and get him out of the deal. 
ABEL Where did it come from? 
ANNA Abel. 
ABEL Where did it come from? 
She stops and thinks, then: ANNA Since 1971 I have been skimming money out of the company. 
Some years a little... others a lot. 
In the beginning it was just in case times got tough but then it was because you were taking all these chances... 
I didn't know what else to do... 
I couldn't risk having us be left with nothing. 
This knocks him back. 
ANNA (CONT'D) I'm sorry. 
ABEL What do you expect me to do with this? 
ANNA Use it.... 
Abel... 
ABEL Is it clean? 
ANNA What does that mean? 
He thinks that through. 123 ABEL It means if you walked into the office of the people who have been trying to put us in jail right now and slapped a check from that account down on their desk would it push me further into hell or help to get me out? 
ANNA It's as clean as every other dollar we've ever made. 
ABEL That's a fucking bullshit answer. 
ANNA I can clear it on the books. 
ABEL Well it sounds like you should take this money and keep it right where it is... because I'm going to pretend that we never had this conversation. 
And you can use that when they drag me off to jail! With that he tries to get passed her and head upstairs. 
She follows and is standing looking up at him. 
ANNA So what's your plan here? 
He turns to her and squares off. 
ABEL I'll get it done. 
And it won't be as a cheat. 
ANNA (Yelling, but controlled enough to not wake the kids.) Oh you are too much. 
You've been walking around your whole life like this all happened because of your hard work, good luck, and charm. 
Mr. Fucking American Dream. 
Well this is America... but it's not a dream, and that wasn't good luck helping you out all those years... 
IT WAS ME! Doing the things you didn't want to know about... 124 ABEL You stole from me! This stops her in her tracks. 
And eventually a little smile comes across her face. 
She comes way down and almost delivers this line in a whisper. 
ANNA Oh... 
You have always been very good about not letting your ego get in the way of business. 
Don't start now just because it's me. 
With that ABEL turns up the stairs and heads to bed. 
INT. MASTER BATHROOM - MORNING ABEL is getting ready for the day shaving. 
He looks exhausted. 
ANNA comes into the room. 
She stands at the entryway just looking at him for a very long beat. 
ABEL We'll use the money... your money. 
It's the smart play. 
ANNA It's our money. 
ABEL I know... 
FADE TO BLACK. Before we see anything, we hear the sound of a pen writing on paper. 
INT. THE TEMPORARY OFFICE TRAILER - DAY ABEL and ANDREW are sitting around the folding table opposite the HASIDS. ABEL signs the document and then picks it up and heads outside. 
EXT. TEMPORARY TRAILER - DAY ABEL comes out and we see ANNA standing outside the trailer in the cold because these guys don't do business with women. 
He hands her the document. 
Under her breath: ANNA These fucking guys...what's this additional $11,000? 125 ABEL I guess there is still some fuel in two of the tanks... they gave us a fair price on it. 
With that they both smile, she signs it and then gives him a kiss. 
INT. TEMPORARY TRAILER - DAY ABEL comes back in and hands the docs to JOSEPH, the oldest Hasid, who signs them. 
JOSEPH Mazel Tov. 
EXT. TRAILER/TANK FARM - DAY ABEL walks across the lot with joy although it seems masked by a sadness. 
He looks around as ANDREW and ANNA come up next to him. 
ANDREW WALSH Congratulations. 
ABEL To you too. 
Did you know...about the money? 
ANNA Abel. 
ANDREW looks him right in the eye. 
ANDREW WALSH Yes. 
ABEL You should have told me. 
ANDREW WALSH I know. 
I'm sorry. 
ANNA Abel...congratulations. 
Now cheer up. 
And can someone give me a tour of this place we just paid two million bucks for? 
ABEL, ANDREW, and ANNA walk towards the tanks looking around. 
They come around the corner to THE VIEW. 126 EXT. BEHIND THE TANKS, WITH A VIEW OF THE CITY - DAY They all look out. 
ANNA What a hell-hole this city is. 
ABEL No. ANDREW WALSH I don't know why but I guess I never realized we even had this view from back here. 
That line sits for a long beat. 
ABEL I did. 
Then they hear someone behind them. 
They turn. 
It's JULIAN. He is standing holding a gun. 
They stare for a long beat. 
ABEL (CONT'D) I thought you said you threw that into the river? 
JULIAN I didn't. 
ABEL I see that. 
JULIAN I have nowhere to go. 
ABEL Nowhere easy. 
JULIAN Fuck you. 
I have nothing. 
And somehow you've ended up with everything you wanted. 
ABEL looks at the gun in his hand. 
ABEL It wasn't meant to be. 
JULIAN What is that supposed to mean? 127 ABEL I know what you wanted. 
But you need to forget that. 
You are looking backward. 
Only look forward, that is what you can control. 
JULIAN I'm sorry. 
You gave me a very good chance. 
Right? 
ABEL Yes. 
JULIAN Probably a better chance than I deserved. 
ABEL No. JULIAN Please take care of my family. 
ABEL Julian. 
JULIAN Please... 
ABEL looks at him trying to read where this poor kid is at. 
ABEL I will. 
With that JULIAN takes the gun and puts it in his mouth and pulls the trigger. 
The gun goes off and the red blood sprays on the white side of the fuel tank that is behind him. 
ABEL and the rest are left totally in shock. 
They are beside themselves. 
But out of the corner of his eye ABEL notices that the bullet has also pierced through the tank and amid the red spray a flow of black heating oil is pouring out through the bullet hole onto the ground. 
ABEL steps around JULIAN'S body and goes over to the hole. 
He picks up an old rag from the ground and stuffs it into the hole plugging the flow of oil. 
ANDREW WALSH What... what should we do? 128 ABEL turns and looks back at him. 
ABEL We call the police. 
ANDREW WALSH Really? 
ABEL Yes! With that he walks off behind the tanks. 
EXT. PARKING LOT, NEXT TO THE TANK FARM SITE - DAY There are now POLICE VEHICLES everywhere. 
ABEL is standing off alone. 
The DA gets out of a car all alone and walks over to ABEL. A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE I'm very sorry. 
Did you know him well? 
ABEL I did. 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE He must have been under a hell of a lot of pressure. 
ABEL Yeah. 
For a while I thought he was... it's just... 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE I'm sorry. 
They look out across the city. 
ABEL You really do have to be lucky. 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE Yes... so you are chasing down hijackers now? 
ABEL I was right there... 
I couldn't help myself. 
LAWRENCE nods approval. 129 ABEL (CONT'D) Have you found the driver? 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE No. ABEL You'll find him. 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE Probably not. 
ABEL Well, thank you for coming. 
I wanted to make sure this was handled correctly. 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE Of course. 
ABEL I'm not sure how I got here. 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE Yeah. 
ABEL So... 
I should tell you that I won't be able to take that deal you offered. 
There is no way I would ever accept a felony charge for anything we've done. 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE I know. 
ABEL I am not a felon. 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE That's probably true. 
ABEL But I also can't have you digging around my life and keeping this hanging around my neck for the next ten years. 
I love fighting a good battle but this... it's very bad for my business. 
This gets Lawrence's attention. 130 ABEL (CONT'D) So, we need to come to some sort of conclusion. 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE We can probably do that. 
ABEL Good. 
They both look out for a beat. 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE I hear you closed on this terminal today? 
ABEL It looks that way. 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE I didn't realize that you had that in the works. 
ABEL For a very long time. 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE That will put you in quite a powerful position. 
ABEL Within my business it has that potential. 
LAWRENCE shifts his tone ever so slightly. 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE If you get this place up and running again it will have significant influence... politically speaking. 
ABEL picks up on the word POLITICALLY and stares down LAWRENCE. A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE (CONT'D) We all have our ambitions. 
ABEL Yes. 
LAWRENCE gives a slight smile and then pauses. 131 A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE And sometimes we need help to get there... 
You've come a very long way. 
ABEL Yes, I have. 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE In a very short time. 
ABEL It doesn't feel that way... 
But please know that I have always chosen the path that was the most right. 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE The most right? 
ABEL Yes. 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE That one makes my head hurt a little. 
ABEL The result is never in question for me. 
Just what path do I take to get there. 
And I have never questioned my path. 
There is always one that is most right. 
And that is what this is. 
A.D.A. 
LAWRENCE I hope so. 
They look at each other and then out over the city. 
THE END
BIG EYES Written by Scott Alexander & Larry Karaszewski FADE IN: TITLE SEQUENCE: TIGHT on TWO PAINTED EYES. The pupils are impossibly wide. 
Imploring. 
The watery rims spill a single tear. 
We PULL OUT... revealing the eyes belong to a child. 
A young girl, fingers clasped pitifully. 
She's forlorn, alone in a dirty gray alley. 
We feel shame. 
Compassion. 
Sorrow... 
Then -- an IDENTICAL girl SLAPS in front of the first one. 
Then another! It's a PRINTING PRESS, the creation of a BLUR of sad children. 
A KINETIC montage! HORDES of gazing WAIFS get lithographed, bundled: Huddling in worry. 
Floating in space. 
POSTERS. POSTCARDS. BOOKS. We ZOOM into a MAGAZINE AD: A 1960's era come-on -- "IT'S KEANE! MUSEUM-QUALITY ART, MAILED DIRECTLY TO YOUR HOME!" A blizzard of NEWSPAPER ARTICLES: "Meet America's Million- Dollar Painter!" "Keane Masterpiece at World's Fair" Painted EYES float by. 
Haunting... questioning... 
Old POLAROIDS: A family Christmas, a Keane print over the mantel. 
Kids play bumper pool, a Keane print in the b.g. 
A blurry black-and-white TV: A talk show HOST holds up a Keane PAINTING -- MUSIC BUILDS. FASTER. Keane brochures. 
Catalogs. 
A flyer: "Now Open! Keane Gallery" MORE orphan's faces. 
Hungry, unblinking, beseeching. 
A CRESCENDO -- then -- SILENCE. A single CARD on black: "I think what Keane has done is just terrific. 
It has to be good. 
If it were bad, so many people wouldn't like it." -- ANDY WARHOL CUT TO: EXT. SUBURBIA - 1958 A nice, orderly tract of post-World War II housing. 
Identical rows of little yards. 
Young MOMS. Scampering KIDS. Then, a SUBTITLE: "TEN YEARS EARLIER" 2. 
INT. HOUSE - DAY CU on two concerned eyes. 
The same eyes as the paintings. 
We REVEAL they belong to a real girl: JANE, 8. 
She sits in her small house -- a typical young family's, spare and underfurnished. 
Suddenly -- Jane's mother MARGARET ULBRICH, 28, rushes through frame. 
Margaret is blonde, yearning, fragile. 
Terribly upset, she is hurriedly packing. 
Margaret throws her clothes in a suitcase. 
She shoves Jane's clothes and toys into another. 
Margaret barrels through the breakfast nook, which is a mini art studio -- easel, canvases, paints. 
She scoops up her supplies. 
Margaret runs to the door -- then turns. 
The hallway is lined with her PAINTINGS. Oils and inks of wide-eyed Jane, who grows from baby to toddler to child. 
Hastily, Margaret takes them down, each frame leaving an empty mark on the flowered wallpaper. 
Finally she reaches the last spot -- a WEDDING PHOTO: Margaret and her HUSBAND, smiling, happy. 
Margaret peers -- then leaves it hanging. 
The door SLAMS. CUT TO: EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY Cars roar down an interstate. 
INT. PACKARD - DRIVING - DAY Margaret grips the wheel, uncertain. 
Jane stares. 
The car is all loaded up. 
REFLECTIONS of passing BILLBOARDS drift across the windshield. 
Images of perky, happy-fake Americans. 
Margaret bites her lip. 
Has she made the right decision...? 
CUT TO: EST. SAN FRANCISCO - DAY San Francisco, 1958! A mix of SKYLINES and STOCK FOOTAGE. EXT. FURNITURE FACTORY - DAY A weathered building: "G & B FURNITURE SUPPLY." Margaret sits in the Packard, fixing her lipstick. 
Jane holds the "WANT ADS," a few circled. 
Margaret gets out and straightens her skirt. 
Jane smiles. 
JANE Good luck. 3. 
INT. FURNITURE FACTORY - DAY A beaten industrial office. 
Margaret sits anxiously, watching the BOSS, a tired guy in a cheap suit. 
He glowers unsurely at her JOB APPLICATION. Scratching his face. 
Hmmmm... 
BOSS We don't get many ladies in here. 
So your husband approves of you working? 
MARGARET (quiet; a soft Southern lilt) My husband and I are separated. 
BOSS (SHOCKED) "Separated"? 
A deadly silence. 
He squirms uncomfortably. 
She presses on. 
MARGARET Sir, I realize I have no employment experience... but I sure need this job. 
I have a daughter to support. (PAUSE) I'm not very good at tooting my own horn... but I love to paint, and if I could just show you my portfolio... 
He is baffled. 
Margaret pulls out a large ARTIST'S PORTFOLIO. She opens it, riffling through the pictures... 
MARGARET I studied at the Watkins Art Institute in Nashville, then took Illustration classes in New York. 
Here's a pastel I did... here's some fashion design... a portrait in charcoal... though I enjoy mixing mediums, preferably oil and ink... 
She's alive, enthused. 
The guy shakes his head. 
BOSS You do understand this is a furniture company? 
CLOSEUP - MARGARET A strained smile. 4. 
INT. FACTORY FLOOR - LATER Margaret works on an enamel baby crib. 
Under stenciled "Humpty Dumpty," she quickly paints on a cartoonish egg man. 
We WIDEN, revealing ten identical, completed cribs behind her. 
We WIDEN again -- revealing a DOZEN PAINTERS. All surrounded by identical cribs. 
All painting identical Humpty Dumpty's. 
CUT TO: EXT. SAN FRANCISCO NORTH BEACH - 1958 - DAY NORTH BEACH! An exotica of Beatniks, palm readers, interracial couples and coffeehouses. 
Ground zero for the Avant Garde. 
Margaret waits on a busy corner, a bit dazed, peering at the parade of fun-loving Hipsters. 
Primly, she fixes herself. 
Margaret turns -- and suddenly grins. 
Running up is DEE-ANN, 30, a Beat girl in a black leotard and sandals. 
Dee-Ann excitedly grabs her, and they laugh and hug girlishly. 
DEE-ANN Sugar, you made it! You're in North Beach! MARGARET Deirdre, look at you! DEE-ANN (CORRECTING) "Dee-Ann." MARGARET "Dee-Ann"?! DEE-ANN Yeah, I know. 
But I hit this scene... and "Deirdre" just sounded like something my mother would call me. 
Margaret giggles. 
DEE-ANN So are you flipping for all this?! Are you settled? 
How's Jane? 
MARGARET Jane -- is swell. 
She's started in a sweet little school. (PAUSE) Though... it's hard without her father. 
I'm not sure we can do this... 
The thought hangs, and Margaret gets emotional. 
Teary-eyed. 5. 
DEE-ANN Oh stop that. 
You're better off. 
Between us, I never liked Frank. 
MARGARET (SHOCKED) You were a bridesmaid! DEE-ANN Exactly. 
That's why I couldn't speak up. 
But if I ever see you wrong off again, I will tell you. (LONG BEAT) Now come on. 
Let's have some fun. 
WIDE - They start WALKING. Dee-Ann gestures. 
DEE-ANN Toss off your middle-class preconceptions! This is Pompeii! We're livin' in the volcano!! For jazz, check up the hungry i. 
For Italian, Vanessi's. 
For salvation, try the Buddhist temple. 
For art, the Six Gallery -- They pass a GALLERY. The displays are stark, Calder-like MOBILES and found-object SCULPTURES. Margaret stares, unsure. 
MARGARET Do they only show Modern? 
DEE-ANN Everyone only shows Modern! (SHE POINTS) In the basement, they've got espresso. 
MARGARET What's espresso? (WORRIED) Is that like reefer? 
Dee-Ann LAUGHS, astounded. 
DEE-ANN You've got a lot to learn! EXT. ART SHOW - DAY A Sunday ART SHOW. It's picturesque, amateur ARTISTS displaying their paintings, jewelry, sculpture... 
The modern stalls are crowded with trendy BOHEMIANS. Abstract lines, speckles of color. 
We drift away... and find Margaret, alone in her stall with Jane. 
Margaret sits patiently, surrounded by Big Eye paintings and charcoal portraits. 
In contrast with the neighbors, her work seems... quaint. 6. 
A pink, chubby TOURIST FAMILY ambles over. 
Margaret brightens hopefully. 
TOURIST GUY Your stuff is cute. 
How much? 
MARGARET Today's a special: Two dollars. 
TOURIST GUY I'll give you one. 
Beat -- then she nods, agreeing. 
She gestures. 
The little BOY sits. 
Margaret clips a fresh sheet of paper, sharpens her charcoal... and... goes motionless. 
Studying the boy's face. 
He gazes back. 
Then -- inspired, she begins sketching his EYES. Large and exaggerated. 
Then she fills in the shape of his head. 
His ears. 
His jaw. 
In a rush, his likeness appears. 
The parents come over to peek -- then gasp. 
Margaret is good. 
She sketches faster. 
Focused. 
Until a LOUD, PLUMMY VOICE drifts in... 
MAN'S VOICE Monet? "Monet"?! Whew -- that's a hell of a compliment. 
Though, if I may respectfully disagree, I'm more in the tradition of Pissarro. 
Margaret looks up, distracted. 
She resumes her work. 
MAN'S VOICE C'mon, get closer. 
Closer! Look at that sunlight coming through the mottled leaves. 
That's a bold yellow! Curious, Margaret casually peers over... 
HER POV Holding court in another booth is WALTER KEANE, 40. 
Walter is astonishing: Hugely confident. 
Charming. 
Waggishly handsome. 
And dressed like an "Artist" -- striped turtleneck, with hands full of brushes. 
Walter's stall is filled with oils of Paris street scenes. 
He casually flirts with TWO YOUNG COEDS. They admire a painting. 
WALTER You wanna touch it? 
Do it! I lay it on thick -- you're not gonna break it! (UNWAVERING) I poured myself into that painting. 
It's thirty-five dollars. 7. 
Walter glances over -- and notices Margaret watching him. 
Shy, she quickly turns away, back to her portrait. 
Walter smiles rakishly. 
He's found a new interest. 
WALTER Excuse me, Ladies. 
WIDE Walter strides up to Margaret. 
She peers nervously... trying to ignore him. 
She sketches faster. 
Shading... 
Walter watches. 
Admiring... and discreetly smelling her hair. 
Margaret pays no attention. 
Done, she blows into a can of Fix- It. Poosh! A fine mist sprays, setting the portrait. 
Without fanfare, she humbly turns the picture. 
MARGARET All finished. 
Her customers gape, impressed. 
She smiles. 
The guy counts out four quarters, then happily leaves. 
MARGARET AND WALTER are left together. 
An unspoken frisson, until -- WALTER You're better than spare change. 
You shouldn't sell yourself so cheap. 
MARGARET I'm just glad they liked it. 
WALTER Ahhh! You're past that point! Your heart is in your work... 
He leans in, too close. 
Margaret shivers. 
Breathing faster. 
WALTER What's your name? 
MARGARET M-Margaret... 
Mmm. 
He grins, checking her out... her loose sexy blouse and tight black capris. 
She flushes. 
MARGARET Wouldn't you rather flirt with those dolls over there? 8. 
WALTER Mm, no. (BEAT) I like you, Margaret... 
He zeroes in on the artworks' signature: "M. 
Ulbrich" WALTER "...Ulbrich." (IMPASSIONED) You know, Margaret Ulbrich, you're undervaluing yourself. 
Lemme show you how it's done. 
Walter spins to Jane. 
He SHOUTS out, like a carnival barker. 
WALTER Little Girl! How would you like your portrait sketched by the World- Renowned Margaret Ulbrich?! Queen of the Bay! In mere minutes, she will capture your soul! Hm. Jane shrugs, unimpressed. 
JANE Nah. 
WALTER "Nah"?! (he grabs a PAINTING) Don't you wish this were you in this beautiful painting?? 
JANE But that IS me! And that's me... (she POINTS all over) And that one started as me, but then Mother turned it into a Chinese boy. 
Huh? 
Walter peers at Jane... then at Margaret. 
And then -- it hits him. 
He grimaces, embarrassed. 
WALTER Oh, you're Mommy! My apologies, Honey. 
I misconstrued the situation. (SHEEPISH) Well I'll just mosey along, before Mr. Ulbrich comes back and socks me in the eye. 
ON MARGARET A gut decision. 
She stares at Walter, then smiles slyly. 
MARGARET Mr. Ulbrich is out of the picture...! 9. 
ON WALTER His face slowly lights up. 
Ah! Sun breaking through clouds. 
CUT TO: EST. FRENCH BISTRO - NIGHT INT. BISTRO - NIGHT An enchanting bistro. 
Wine barrels, laughing, twinkly tivoli lights. 
Perfection. 
Walter flamboyantly enters, escorting Margaret. 
Instantly, the STAFF ERUPTS in excitement: "Monsieur Keane! Ah, Monsieur Keane is here! Bonsoir!" WALTER Bonsoir, gang! Henri! Sorry I didn't call first. 
Est-ce que tout va bien? 
MAITRE'D Je vais bien, merci! Comment allez- vous? 
WALTER Je vais bien! I'm with a beautiful woman! Could life be any grander?? 
They get led in. 
Margaret is dazzled. 
Walter whispers. 
WALTER And I don't even have to pay! I'm set because I gave the chef a painting. 
You know what he said? "Nobody paints Montmartre like Walter Keane!" LATER Margaret and Walter enjoy an intimate dinner. 
The wine flows. 
MARGARET I can't believe you lived in Paris. 
WALTER Best time of my life... 
MARGARET I've never even been on an airplane. 
WALTER Well you have to experience these things! Grab 'em!! (JOCUND) I wanted to be an artist, so I just went! Studied painting at the Beaux- Arts. 
Lived in a Left Bank studio. 
I survived on bread and wine... 10. 
MARGARET You're a romantic. 
WALTER Damn right! A wistful shrug. 
He chugs his glass. 
WALTER Of course, walkin' away from the bourgeois scene wasn't a snap. 
I had to quit my job. 
Leave my wife. 
These choices aren't easy... 
She stares at her wine. 
MARGARET I've never acted freely. 
I was the daughter. 
The wife. 
The mother... (SHE SIGHS) All my paintings are of Jane, because she's all I know. 
WALTER You shouldn't knock your work. 
I'd give an eyetooth to have your talent. 
Margaret is taken aback. 
He's absolutely sincere. 
WALTER You can look into someone and capture them on canvas! You paint people! (he gestures sadly) I can only paint -- things. 
My street scenes are charming... but at the end of the day, it's just a collection of sidewalks and buildings. 
Walter goes silent. 
He has revealed his fears. 
ANGLE - MARGARET She doesn't know what to say. 
Gently, she takes his hand. 
MARGARET Walter, I'd bet you could paint anything. 
WALTER (INTENSE) Whew... 
Baby, when you look at me like that, I could fall hard. 
Margaret gulps. 
Afraid to talk. 11. 
MARGARET This is moving fast. 
You're my first date in a long time... 
Neither of them speaks. 
The tension builds -- There is a spark between them... 
CUT TO: EXT. PALACE OF FINE ARTS - DAY A lush green knoll, overlooking the park. 
Margaret and Walter have set-up TWO EASELS. They both smoke cigarettes. 
Margaret is spattered with paint, stirring colors. 
Walter paces about, framing the scene with his fingers. 
Jane sits in front of them, playing paddleball. 
Bonk! Bonk! MARGARET Sweetie, could you stop fidgeting? 
JANE Mother, after all this time, you MUST know what my face looks like. 
Margaret winces. 
Walter laughs. 
She gets busy, penciling in LARGE OVAL EYES. Then -- quick marks for the mouth and nose. 
Impatient, Jane spies on Walter's canvas. 
JANE Hey! Your canvas is blank! WALTER Er, you can't rush inspiration -- MARGARET Jane! Don't bother Mr. Keane. 
You know creativity has to well up from the inside... 
WALTER Don't worry. 
She's not bothering me...! Walter leaves Jane. 
He points at Margaret's canvas. 
WALTER There's something I gotta ask you. 
What's with the big crazy eyes...? 
MARGARET I believe things can be seen in eyes. 
They're the windows of the soul -- 12. 
WALTER Yeah, but, c'mon! You draw 'em like pancakes! I mean, they're WAY out of proportion! He's having fun, but she remains serious. 
MARGARET Eyes are how I express my emotions. 
That's how I've always drawn them. (EARNEST) When I was little, I had surgery that left me deaf for a period. 
I couldn't hear, so I found myself staring... 
Relying on people's eyes... 
She smiles shyly. 
Understanding, he smiles back. 
Then -- VOICE Walter? 
Hey -- Walt! Walter spins, startled. 
A FRIENDLY GUY in a suit strolls up. 
FRIENDLY GUY I thought that was you! WALTER (EMBARRASSED) Oh! Uh... er, hi, Don. 
FRIENDLY GUY Boy, I'm glad to see you! Have we heard back from the city, on that setback? 
My guys really need the variance, for the first floor retail. 
Walter is mortified. 
He turns away from Margaret. 
WALTER Um... we should hear from Permits by Thursday. 
FRIENDLY GUY Yeah? 
Well that's terrif'! I'll tell the architects! Pleased, the guy cheerily strides away. 
ON WALTER AND MARGARET He is stricken. 
Something ominous just happened. 
MARGARET What was that?? 13. 
WALTER (ASHAMED) I -- I didn't want you to know... 
A long, horrible pause. 
Walter's face turns gray. 
We SLOWLY PUSH IN. This revelation is churning. 
Agony. 
WALTER I'm in commercial real estate. 
A stunned beat. 
MARGARET You're a -- Realtor? 
WALTER (CONTRITE) YES! A hugely successful Realtor! Top earner in the Downtown office three years running! MARGARET And you're... ashamed? 
WALTER Of course! Any blockhead can arrange a sublet! (HEARTFELT) All I ever wanted was to support myself as an artist... (SAD; BEAT) I tried to make a clean break, but couldn't cut it. 
I'm just a goddam Sunday painter. 
An amateur. 
Margaret looks at him, touched by his vulnerability. 
CUT TO: INT. MARGARET'S APARTMENT - DUSK End of the day. 
Golden light slants in through the windows of this small tidy apartment. 
The door opens. 
Margaret holds it for Walter, who chivalrously staggers in, carrying all her supplies: Easel, paints, cans. 
He carefully puts it all down -- then turns. 
Beat. 
Walter stares at Margaret, their faces caught in the warm light. 
Then, enchanted, he kisses her. 
Silence. 
Margaret smiles, captivated. 
Caught in his glow. 
The moment could last forever... 14. 
IN THE DOORWAY Jane stares unhappily. 
Threatened. 
JANE A-hem! ON MARGARET She turns, startled. 
Feeling guilty, Margaret rushes from Walter. 
Busying herself, she skims through the MAIL. Jane shakes her head and marches out. 
Margaret flips through envelopes -- until one stops her. 
On edge, she slowly removes an official DOCUMENT. She scans it... and her face drops. 
Crushed. 
Something terrible... 
Walter is worried. 
WALTER What's wrong...? 
MARGARET (SOFT) Frank wants to take away Jane. 
He says I'm an unfit mother... 
Walter is taken aback. 
WALTER You're a perfect mother. 
MARGARET He told the court Jane doesn't have a proper home. 
It's beyond my abilities as a single woman... 
Margaret trails off, shaken. 
Walter gulps unsurely. 
Then, he takes her in his arms. 
We SLOWLY PUSH IN. WALTER Marry me. 
MARGARET (SHE GASPS) Walter! I -- WALTER (he puts a finger to her lips) Shh. 
Don't think of a reason to say no. 'Cause I've got a million reasons to say yes. (he gives a winning smile) I know it makes no sense! (MORE) 15. 
WALTER (CONT'D) But just think of the fun we'll have..! And I'll take care of you girls. 
Margaret stammers, speechless. 
She doesn't know what to say. 
Walter pulls out his ace. 
In a debonair move, he creakily drops to his knee. 
He exudes a hammy, wonderful romance: WALTER Margaret, I'm on my knee! C'mon, whatdya say? 
Let's get married! We can be in Hawaii by the weekend. 
MARGARET "Hawaii"? 
M-marriage? (EMOTIONAL) Walter, I'm crazy about you... but I'm overwhelmed. 
Why would we go to Hawaii?! WALTER (BEGUILING) Because you're a princess... and you deserve to get married in paradise. 
CLOSEUP - MARGARET Margaret shudders, tears in her eyes. 
Hawaiian MUSIC begins... 
DISSOLVE TO: STOCK FOOTAGE - DAY A propeller-driven PAN AM airplane soars through the sky. 
EXT. HAWAII - DAY Hawaii, 1958. 
Heaven on earth. 
Blossoming flowers, rare birds, lush greenery. 
Margaret is experiencing total bliss. 
We widen. 
She and Walter stand in front of a waterfall, getting married. 
Jane is Maid-of-Honor. 
A PRIEST smiles, and Walter places a ring on Margaret's finger. 
They kiss. 
EXT. BEACH - SUNSET Margaret and Walter lie on the sand, making out. 
Cuddling, running their fingers along each other's bodies. 
She stares up, endlessly happy. 
MARGARET You're right... this is paradise. 
Only God could make those colors. 
WALTER I knew you'd love it. 16. 
MARGARET Oh, can't we stay here forever?? 
WALTER Well, I don't know about forever. 
But maybe... 
I can arrange another week. 
EXT. HOTEL GROUNDS - DAY Thatched umbrellas, Polynesian fun. 
Margaret is set-up, drawing PORTRAITS of the GUESTS. Walter regales them as they wait. 
Joking, gregariously handing out Mai-Tais. 
Margaret finishes a picture. 
She beams at Walter... then signs the picture "KEANE." Walter gapes, astonished at this gesture. 
Margaret lock eyes with him. 
She smiles girlishly, radiating happiness. 
CUT TO: INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - DAY Old school Cantonese: Dragons and red lacquer. 
Margaret eats lunch with Dee-Ann, showing off SNAPSHOTS from the trip. 
MARGARET This is a waterfall... the air was so fresh you could taste it. 
Here's an ancient altar... that statue is Kane, the god of creation. 
I said a prayer to him. 
Oh! Here's Walter and Janie, building a sandcastle -- Dee-Ann raises an eyebrow. 
DEE-ANN This is all happening mighty quick. 
In the time you moved here, I've had two dates. 
You're already married. 
MARGARET (SHE GIGGLES) I thought there was a void in my life. 
Well... 
Walter's filled it. 
DEE-ANN Walter's filled a lot of things. 
He's diddled every skirt on the art circuit. 
MARGARET You're talking about my husband! DEE-ANN I know! That's why I brought it up. 
Margaret frowns, insulted. 17. 
MARGARET I'm not naive. (beat; she laughs) Well, I am naive. 
But I know the man I'm marrying. 
Walter can act rash... but he's a good provider. 
And he's wonderful with Jane. (CLEAR-EYED) Look -- we're both looking for a fresh start. 
I'm a divorcee with a child. 
Walter is a blessing. 
Dee-Ann bites her tongue. 
The WAITER brings over the check. 
Sitting on it are TWO FORTUNE COOKIES. Hm. Margaret stares, utterly serious. 
She reaches for one... then impulsively grabs the other. 
She cracks the cookie. 
Dee- Ann waits, curious. 
Margaret reads... then slowly smiles. 
MARGARET "You are on the threshold of untold success." INT. ART GALLERY - DAY A Modish, happening gallery. 
The white walls are hung with ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONISM: Slashing angles of color, painted over rags and glued bolts. 
On the floor is SCULPTURE made from wood and wire. 
In charge is RUBEN, a fussy man in a goatee. 
He's schmoozing a FANCY LADY. They look at a spattered, distorted painting. 
RUBEN What's brilliant about the composition is its spontaneity. 
The image has no visual center of attention. 
FANCY LADY It's quite gestural. 
RUBEN Oh definitely! Strongly influenced by the tachistes. 
FANCY LADY I heard Tab Hunter was in here, looking at one. 
RUBEN Well... 
I'm not allowed to say... 
He NODS HIS HEAD up-and-down: Yes, you're right. 
OUTSIDE A car backfires. 
Ruben turns -- and winces. 18. 
Through the windows is Walter, climbing out of his massive white Cadillac. 
He's all done up, in beret and scarf. 
He opens the giant trunk and removes a pile of paintings. 
Ruben cringes knowingly. 
He whispers: RUBEN Oh Christ, don't come in here. 
Please don't come in here... 
The door SLAMS. Walter loudly barges in. 
WALTER Ruben, good day! Do you got a minute? 
RUBEN Walter. 
In polite society, the word is "appointment." FANCY LADY (glancing back and forth) Uh, I could come back later... 
She anxiously hurries for the door. 
Ruben fumes. 
Walter ignores it all and starts laying out his wares. 
First, the Parisian street scenes, one after another... 
WALTER You're gonna love my stuff today. 
RUBEN Haven't I seen that one before? 
WALTER Nah! That was painted in the Fifth Arrondissement. 
This is the Sixth Arrondissement! RUBEN (SKEPTICAL) I don't understand. 
You lived in Paris for a week. 
How can you still be cranking out paintings? 
Walter laughs. 
He points to his head. 
WALTER It's all up here. (beat; a sentimental FLOURISH) And here. 
He points to his heart. 
Ruben frowns and points to the wall. 19. 
RUBEN Well, it's not going up here. (CRUEL) Walter, you know we don't go for that representational jazz! You're too literal. 
WALTER (HURT) Hey, Art isn't fashion! RUBEN Yes it IS! (CUTTING) People want Kandinsky, or Rothko! They don't want goopy street scenes. 
CLOSEUP - WALTER Ouch! This stings terribly. 
Walter glares at the man, then softly slides aside his works. 
Quietly, he pulls out Margaret's Big Eye paintings. 
WALTER Would they want... this? 
RUBEN (HE SHUDDERS) Good God! You've entered a new period. 
WALTER No... they're my wife's. 
Fascinated, Ruben glances through Margaret's oils. 
Canvas after canvas of sad kiddies against gray, bleak backgrounds. 
RUBEN Why are their eyes so big?! They're like big stale jellybeans. 
WALTER (SNIDE) It's Expressionism. 
Surely you recognize it. 
RUBEN (LONG BEAT) Well -- I'm just glad you two found each other. 
WALTER So... what do you say? 
Ruben looks up, amazed. 
Walter seems oblivious. 20. 
RUBEN I say, NO! It's not art. 
WALTER (HORRIFIED) Not -- "art"?? 
RUBEN It's like the back of a magazine! "Draw the turtle! Send in a nickel and win the Big Contest!" WALTER How dare you! Lots of people would like this. 
RUBEN Well, nobody who's walking through the door of this gallery! (BEAT) Now please! Clear out this clutter, before the taste police arrives. 
Walter's jaw drops. 
CUT TO: EXT. HUNGRY I MARQUEE - NIGHT "The hungry i" -- the hottest nightclub around, so hip it's in a basement. 
The marquee says "Cal Tjader, TONIGHT!" INT. HUNGRY I SHOWROOM - NIGHT A swinging mob of BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE -- suits, gowns and pearls. 
CAL TJADER'S BAND is crazed: Vibes and bongo-driven JAZZ. Margaret and Walter are squeezed at a table. 
She nurses a Grasshopper. 
Walter's in a foul mood, CHUGGING cocktails. 
WALTER We'll never break in...! Because there's a CABAL. A secret society of gallery owners and critics, who get together for Sunday brunch in Sausalito, deciding what's "cool." (BROODING) They're like Freemasons. 
No, worse! McCarthy, in his hearings: "That painter, I anoint. 
That painter, I banish to nowheresville!" Heartfelt, Margaret disagrees. 
MARGARET I think people buy art because it touches them -- 21. 
WALTER Heh! You're livin' in fairy land! People don't get to discover a thing. 
They buy art, because it's in the right place at the right time. 
O.s., MUSIC BUILDS. Muddled, Walter turns. 
He looks -- and then -- his eyes light up. 
He is getting an idea... 
ONSTAGE The band speeds to a climax, the percussion throbbing. 
Then, a final, crazed note. 
BAM!! The crowd APPLAUDS. The club's owner, ENRICO BANDUCCI, bounds on stage. 
Banducci is a theatrical, natty Italian guy with a skinny moustache and loud personality. 
He grabs a mike. 
BANDUCCI Give it up for Cal Tjader! That set was HUMMIN'! Al-aright, be sure to stick around for the one a.m. show! The house lights come up. 
Banducci hops down, greeting guests, making his way out -- when Walter glides up. 
WALTER Hey, Banducci. 
I love the music tonight. 
It's a gas. 
BANDUCCI Oh. Thanks, thanks. 
WALTER I'm Walter Keane. 
I'm a painter. (KNOWING) I was looking at your walls, and they're pretty plain. 
BANDUCCI Really? 
Hm...! Maybe you're right. 
What color were you thinking? 
Huh? 
Walter holds his composure. 
WALTER No -- I'm an artist. 
I used to be based on the Left Bank. 
But now I've relocated to the "States," and I'm looking for an... exhibition venue. 
Beat. 
Banducci frowns. 
BANDUCCI I like my club the way it is. 
Your stuff's so hot, go put it in a museum. 22. 
WALTER Okay! I respect that. 
You're a businessman, not a charity! So how 'bout if I, uh... rented your walls? 
Hm?! Banducci raises an eyebrow. 
CUT TO: INT. BERKELEY APARTMENT - DAY Walter's swanky pad is CHAOS, filled with cameras and lights. 
A PHOTOGRAPHER runs around, tweaking equipment. 
Walter's at an easel, putting the final touches on a PAINTING of a French street scene. 
He gabs on the PHONE. WALTER Yes! The paintings are available for public viewing daily, from 7 to 3! (an awkward beat) Er, no. 3 a.m. 
It's in a nightclub. (he hangs up) Maggie! It's promotion time! We gotta lay the racket! Margaret puts on a smock, a bit dumbfounded. 
Walter spatters some paint on his shirt. 
He grins, then holds up his brush and SIGNS the painting: "W. 
KEANE" Margaret forces a "cheese" smile, with her Waif. 
FLASH! The camera pops. 
CUT TO: INT. HUNGRY I - NIGHT CU - A cheery BROCHURE, "Meet the Keanes!" There's a staged PHOTO: Walter at his street scene, Margaret at her Waif. 
Then -- a SHOE steps on it. 
We WIDEN... revealing the brochure on the sticky floor of... 
THE CLUB! It throbs with frolicking CUSTOMERS. We move through the pack. 
To a rear concrete hallway... to a sign with an arrow: "TOILETS." We go down the hall... into... 
A DINGY CORRIDOR The Keane paintings hang here. 
The only human in sight is Walter, forlorn at a card table. 
Brochures are stacked, and he wears a sailor coat with a dandyish ascot. 
The image is grim. 
Walter listens to the raucous mob. 
Until, THUMP! -- a sloshed MAN stumbles in. 
Walter brightens and stands. 23. 
WALTER Ah, beautiful! An art lover! Yes sir, how may I help you? 
MAN (UNCLEAR) I'm, uh, just looking for the john. 
A terrible pause. 
Walter swallows his outrage... then points. 
The guy smiles and tosses Walter a BUCK, as a tip. 
Walter is stunned. 
The guy toddles away. 
Beat. 
The Ladies Room opens, and TWO GOSSIPY WOMEN rush out, oblivious to Walter. 
He glowers. 
ANOTHER MAN bounds in, right up to one of Walter's paintings! He stops at it. 
Walter gathers a moment of hope. 
Does he like it? 
Then the man leans down and opens a CLOSET. He removes a tray of bar glasses, kicks the door shut, and scoots away. 
ANGLE - WALTER He grimaces... beaten. 
Walter drops his head on the table. 
Not noticing a DRUNK COUPLE stagger in. 
They pass a Waif, then halt -- taken. 
They lean in. 
Enthralled... concerned... 
TIPSY LADY Look at that child. 
She's so sad. 
TIPSY MAN Is she poor..? 
TIPSY LADY She's forgotten! It just makes me want to cry. (she peers at the signature, then turns) Are you "Keane"? 
Walter lifts his head from the table. 
WALTER Yeah. 
TIPSY LADY Well you're a hell of a painter. 
Walter squints, confused, then beams. 
Joy! Happiness bursting like a little child. 
WALTER Why, thank you...! Thank you so much! 24. 
TIPSY LADY Your work is very powerful. 
There's so much emotion in those eyes. 
OUCH! Walter's smile collapses. 
TIPSY LADY Is something wrong? 
WALTER (REELING) Huh? 
Uh... no. 
No. I just didn't realize you meant... the waif. 
TIPSY MAN (beat; he CHUCKLES) Oh, I get it...! The artist doesn't wanna part with his favorite piece... 
The man winks, then pulls out a WAD OF BILLS. Walter stares morosely. 
INT. HUNGRY I - LATER Walter sits at the bar, toasted, drinking. 
In a dark place. 
His misery is interrupted by happy Banducci, groping two GALS. BANDUCCI Hello, Picasso! Nice crowd, eh? 
WALTER (SOUR) You wouldn't know it from that broom closet you parked me in. 
BANDUCCI Hey, it's prime thoroughfare! People drink, they gotta relieve themselves. 
WALTER (MUTTERING) "Location, location, location..." Walter wallows in self-loathing. 
Suddenly, he explodes. 
WALTER It's INSULTING! When people see art, they shouldn't think of SHIT! BANDUCCI (SHOCKED) Whoah! Watch it with the purple language. 
We got ladies present --! Banducci PUSHES Walter away. 25. 
In reaction, Walter sloppily SMACKS him. 
Riled, Banducci suddenly takes a SWING! Walter stumbles, and Banducci's punch accidently HITS the GIRL. Ow! She topples. 
Walter gasps. 
He SWATS Banducci -- then RUNS! Cameras FLASH. Wild whoops. 
Walter barrels down the hall, Banducci chasing. 
The brawl's gone nuts. 
Walter grabs a Waif and SMASHES it over Banducci's head. 
CRASH! Banducci drops. 
CUT TO: INSERT - SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER The front page! A small headline says "BISTRO BRAWL: BANDUCCI AND ARTIST SLUGFEST." Below are two PHOTOS: Walter mid-punch, and Banducci unconscious, sticking out of the Big Eye. 
EXT. POLICE STATION - DAWN A neighborhood precinct, quiet at 6 a.m. 
Doors open, and Margaret leads Walter out. 
She's seething. 
He's bruised, with a mortified drunk-tank, slept-in-my-clothes swagger. 
MARGARET I've never posted bail before. 
Silence. 
He has no idea what to say. 
His aplomb crumbles. 
WALTER I'm -- I'm sorry. 
Banducci... laughed at our work. ...So I socked him. 
MARGARET Since when are you thin-skinned? 
Artists have to handle criticism. 
WALTER You're right! I know. 
But... 
I was already in a bad place. 
I'd had a couple... and earlier... (PAUSE) I let some guy think I painted your Big Eye. 
Beat. 
Margaret is stupefied. 
MARGARET I don't understand. 
Why would you do such a thing?! WALTER It was a misunderstanding. 
And then, I didn't want to jinx the sale. 26. 
He shrugs feebly. 
She frowns. 
MARGARET Don't ever do it again. 
INT. HUNGRY I - NIGHT The club is a ZOO. PARTYERS swarm the door, trying to enter. 
Suddenly, Walter pushes his way down the outside stairs. 
The DOORMAN starts to protest, but Walter somberly waves him off. 
WALTER Don't give me a hard time. 
I'm just grabbing my stuff... 
Across the packed room, he spots Banducci with a black eye. 
Walter halts, uncertain. 
A bristling tension... 
Until -- Banducci suddenly rushes and GRABS him! Walter flails, freaked. 
Banducci DRAGS him into a back kitchen -- INT. CLUB KITCHEN Banducci shuts the door, looks around... then suddenly LAUGHS! He grins manically and pulls Walter into a hearty HUG. BANDUCCI Can you believe this? 
We're sold out, and I don't even have a headliner!! (GLEEFUL) Hell, it's a Monday! Walter blinks, lost. 
Banducci explains. 
BANDUCCI Dope, we made the front page!! People are here, cause they wanna see the sappy paintings that made grown men fight!! A moment of discombobulation... until -- Walter slowly grins. 
INT. CLUB - SECONDS LATER The two men suddenly tumble into view, SCREAMING. WALTER I'll see you in COURT, you son of a bitch! I'm suing you for assault! Slander! False arrest!! Banducci storms away. 
Walter shudders, "upset." CUSTOMERS peer at him... then at the paintings. 
Curious, they migrate that way... 27. 
Walter glances sideways. 
Gauging their reactions... 
Until -- a swinging middle-aged guy in horn rims and a suit lopes up. 
DICK NOLAN: A man who hides his bored emptiness under a veneer of booze and broads. 
Dick leans in. 
DICK Yes sir! Whew. 
That was quite a load of horseshit you gents were layin' out there. (LONG BEAT) Dick Nolan. 
The Examiner. 
Walter freezes up. 
Until -- Dick grins conspiratorially. 
DICK Hey pal, don't lose any sleep. 
I eat this stuff with a spoon! It gives me something to type about, in my column. 
WALTER (he laughs, relieved) I thought you only did celebrities. 
DICK Well, Banducci's famous -- and you hit him! So you're a celebrity, once- removed. (HE CHUCKLES) Buy me a drink? 
WALTER Huh? 
Uh, sure -- Dick smoothly drags him to the bar. 
Dick waves the bartender. 
DICK Gary! I'll have a Ward Eight, in a frosted high boy. 
My friend'll have the same. (he beams, then turns) So! Walter, tell me about your work -- WALTER Well, when I was in Paris... 
DICK Jesus, not those! I mean the little hobo kids. 
What?! Walter frowns, peeved. 
He considers this indignity... then decides to stomach it. 
He smiles fakely, effusively. 
WALTER What do you wanna know...?! CUT TO: 28. 
INT. BERKELEY APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT Margaret is asleep. 
Suddenly Walter bursts in, drunk and jocular. 
He FLIPS on the lights. 
WALTER Ding-a-ling! Wake up, we're a HIT! Margaret rolls over, groggy. 
Walter jumps on the bed, grinning. 
He tosses her a HANDFUL OF MONEY. WALTER What a night! I sold out all your Big Eyes!! She rubs her eyes, amazed. 
MARGARET There must be two-hundred dollars... 
WALTER They adore you! Cause of that article, the joint was PACKED. And then, a famous journalist showed up, and -- I need more paintings! Now! He hungrily KISSES her. 
She laughs. 
MARGARET Walter, they take at least a week. 
There's layering, shading -- WALTER Of course! But, this is opportunity! Ah, we're gonna make a crackerjack team: Me schmoozing up the club, while you're back here, doing what you love! She stares at him -- then smiles. 
MUSIC... 
CUT TO: INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT Margaret happily paints away. 
At peace, lost in her art... 
INT. HUNGRY I - NIGHT Walter sells Big Eyes. 
Shoving cash into a cigar box. 
INT. APARTMENT - DAY Margaret works, HUMMING serenely. 
On the easel is a half- finished blonde girl in a blue dress. 29. 
INT. TAILOR'S - DAY Walter buys a new suit. 
A TAILOR measures him. 
INT. APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT Margaret finishes painting a sad boy, using a fine brush to add a watery rim to his eyes. 
Magically, this detail brings the picture to life. 
She's pleased. 
Margaret signs "KEANE." There are two finished canvases, the sad little girl and boy. 
Margaret smiles, her heart swelling. 
She loves them. 
Then, she looks about. 
Nobody is there to share the moment. 
Hm. She thinks -- then picks up the PHONE. She dials. 
MARGARET Mrs. 
Cava, I'm sorry to bother you so late... but would you mind watching Jane? 
INT. TAXI - NIGHT Margaret rides in the back seat, smiling, her gaze faraway. 
She proudly hugs the bundled paintings to her chest. 
INT. HUNGRY I - NIGHT The club is pounding. 
Margaret enters the throng, carrying her work. 
She looks up -- and has her breath taken away. 
The ENTIRE CLUB, EVERY WALL, IS NOW HUNG WITH KEANE PAINTINGS! Whoa...! Pure joy envelops her. 
Then -- she gets jostled. 
Margaret notices Walter holding court with some GROUPIES. She approaches, unnoticed: WALTER ...yeah, eyes are powerful. 
A poet said they're the windows of the soul. 
Margaret smiles, touched. 
She comes closer.... 
GROUPIE They hold so much feeling. 
WALTER You got it! That's why I paint 'em so big. (BEAT) I've always done it that way. 
CLOSEUP - MARGARET She GASPS, stunned. 
The room starts spinning. 30. 
HER POV WALTER If you like this style, I'm working on a few new pieces. 
I've got a little blonde girl in a blue dress that'll tear your heart out. 
ANGLE - MARGARET Her face goes ashen. 
Dizzy, she clutches for support. 
What to do?? 
Overcome, she shrinks away... disappearing... ending up alone in a corner. 
She cowers, childlike. 
ACROSS THE ROOM Walter LAUGHS at a joke, then backslaps the group. 
He jovially strides away... passing by Margaret... when -- MARGARET Walter...? 
He spins -- shocked at her presence. 
WALTER Baby! (DISCOMBOBULATED) Hey, uh, what are you doing here? 
I UM -- MARGARET Why are you lying? 
For once, Walter has no answer. 
She bores in, emotions racing. 
Confused. 
Hurt. 
MARGARET You're taking credit for something that isn't yours. 
He looks ill. 
Wheels spinning, looking for an out -- WALTER I was... trying to close the deal -- MARGARET Those children are part of my being! WALTER I'm just a salesman! You know, buyers pay more if they meet the painter -- MARGARET They couldn't meet me, because you told me to stay home!! 31. 
WALTER Shh, QUIET! He grabs her, pulling her behind a curtain. 
He's desperate. 
WALTER Don't blow this! Look, we're makin' money! Your pocket, my pocket? 
What's the difference?! MARGARET (TREMBLING) You take this so lightly -- WALTER Not all all! But it's not about ego! You wanna say you did the street scenes? 
Fine! I don't care! Say a monkey painted it! She breaks into tears, sobbing. 
MARGARET I'm glad you can dash off your pieces without any emotional connection...! WALTER Ah, honey! I just wanna share them with the world! (BEAT) Would you rather have your children piled in a closet... or hanging in someone's living room? 
Silence. 
Then -- FLASH! FLASH! FLASH! Walter turns. 
And -- his eyes pop, astonished. 
AT THE DOOR Is an incredible sight. 
Like a moment from "La Dolce Vita," a fabulously dressed ITALIAN MAN with THREE BLONDES floats down the stairs, into the club. 
Cameras FLASH. Walter gapes, transfixed. 
He grabs Banducci. 
WALTER Hey. 
Who is that remarkably handsome and confident man? 
BANDUCCI That's Dino Olivetti -- as in Olivetti typewriters. (HE SMIRKS) (MORE) 32. 
BANDUCCI (CONT'D) Don't even try, Walter. 
He doesn't speak a lick of English. 
Walter stares hungrily. 
ANGLE - OLIVETTI glides into the club -- a vision of perfection with his slick hair and sunglasses. 
He approaches closer, closer... when he gets distracted. 
By one of Margaret's Big Eye PAINTINGS. Walter gasps. 
He nudges Margaret. 
Olivetti peers at the artwork. 
Intrigued. 
Then -- excited. 
He starts gesturing and yapping in ITALIAN. The Blondes shout back. 
Everyone is getting worked-up. 
The big-bosomed Blonde turns to Walter. 
EUROPEAN BLONDE Mr. Olivetti is enchanted with the painting. 
He would like to know... who is the artist? 
ANGLE - MARGARET AND WALTER The moment of truth. 
Margaret opens her mouth... and no sound comes out. 
She clenches up. 
Stomach tight. 
Mute. 
Walter gives her a second -- tick tock tick tock. 
Then -- he leaps into Opportunity. 
He SMACKS his hands. 
WALTER I am! Walter swoops over and grabs Olivetti in a hearty clasp. 
WALTER It's a delight to meet you, Signore! Buon giorno! Have you been an art lover for long..? 
We move in tight on MARGARET, as the SOUND DIALS DOWN. WALTER'S VOICE I call that piece "The Waif." Isn't it striking? 
With its juxtaposition of girl, cat, and stairs... and its almost Flemish use of underpigment... 
The SOUND dims... then goes SILENT. Margaret stares in shock, unmoving. 
Time seems to stop. 
She is frozen in grief. 
Until -- 33. 
WALTER'S VOICE Baby! Baby! Can you believe it?!! CUT TO: MINUTES LATER Time has passed. 
Walter happily clutches Margaret. 
WALTER We made five grand!! Five THOUSAND dollars...!!! (GIDDY) And that wasn't even one of your good ones! Margaret blinks, lost. 
In the b.g., Olivetti holds the painting, now wrapped-up in newspaper and twine. 
A pleased customer. 
Margaret's face darkens. 
MARGARET Don't you mean... one of your good ones? 
WALTER No. No no! One of -- OUR good ones. (the spirit of generosity, he hands her a CHECK) Look at those zeroes! We've hit the big time! We are now hanging in the collection of Italian industrialist Dino Olivetti! With his patronage comes credibility! And with credibility comes RESPECT! Margaret stares at the check in her hands. 
At all the zeroes. 
MARGARET What about... honesty? 
WALTER Aw c'mon! The paintings say "Keane"! I'm Keane, you're Keane. 
From now on, we are one and the same. 
Walter pulls her tight. 
She doesn't resist. 
CUT TO: SERIES OF SHOTS: 34. 
INT. APARTMENT - DAY Upbeat MUSIC. Walter frantically tosses all the BROCHURES of him and Margaret into a FIREPLACE. They burn to ash. 
INSERT - NEWSPAPER We ZOOM into Dick Nolan's SOCIETY COLUMN. Under a caricature of Dick is a highlighted ITEM. We hear TYPING: DICK'S HUSHED VOICE "What exactly is local painter Walter Keane up to? 
My spies tell me a big announcement is forthcoming...!" EXT. CITY HALL - DAY Walter proudly hands a painting to the confused-looking MAYOR. WALTER On behalf of the children of the world, we present this painting to Mayor Christopher! EXT. PUBLIC BUILDING - DAY Walter thrusts a painted Ballerina at a SOVIET DIPLOMAT. WALTER In the interest of peace through culture, we donate this painting to the people of Russia! INT. PHONEBOOTH - NIGHT Dick whispers into a phone. 
DICK The Purple Onion. 9:30. 
Joan Crawford has a dinner reservation. 
INT. PURPLE ONION - NIGHT JOAN CRAWFORD is eating with friends. 
Suddenly Walter lunges into view, startling her. 
He lugs a painting. 
WALTER Miss Crawford! In recognition of your cinematic craft, we bestow this painting, "The Lion and the Child"! INT. APARTMENT - DAY Margaret paints. 
Walter beams. 35. 
WALTER Joan said "Marvelous"! MARVELOUS! That's worth more than 1000 critics! (he CLAPS his hands) Hey, maybe she'll come to our opening. 
MARGARET But... isn't it strange? 
Artists get shown. 
They don't build their own galleries. 
WALTER Says who?! Like John Q. 
Public cares? 
He's FED UP with abstract neoformalism! She responds -- but he sexily puts his finger to her mouth. 
WALTER He digs real art. 
Your art! It's beautiful. 
You're beautiful... 
Walter starts rubbing against her, dancing sensually. 
She laughs, embarrassed, her wet paint brushes smearing his chest. 
She relents and relaxes. 
They dance around... 
CUT TO: EXT. CITY STREETS - EARLY MORNING In the shadows, POSTERS of "The Waif" get glued up. 
Under her woeful face, it says "KEANE GALLERY 494 Broadway." We WIDEN, as Walter, Margaret and Jane hastily slap up the posters. 
They carry glue buckets and a ladder. 
WALTER Ruben's gonna choke when he sees this! Little Jane tiredly glues another poster. 
She yawns. 
JANE I remember when Momma painted that. 
Huh? 
Suddenly, Margaret freezes. 
She hadn't anticipated this. 
Margaret looks to Walter. 
He stares back, waiting. 
MARGARET Are you -- sure? 
That was a long time ago. 
JANE Sure I'm sure! It was in our old apartment, and you had me sit on a stool in the kitchen -- 36. 
WALTER (CUTTING IN) No, dear, I'm afraid you're confused. 
I painted that one -- JANE No, Mother did! Look! I'm wearing my blue dress. 
MARGARET L-lots of girls have that dress... 
Margaret trails off, sickened. 
Not knowing how to lie. 
Walter takes charge. 
He kneels, then smiles gently at Jane. 
WALTER You have a good eye, sweetie. 
I painted it, but I was trying to mimic your mother's style. 
You know, the style she USED to paint in. 
CLOSEUP - JANE A loooooong pause. 
She examines the print. 
Then... she nods. 
JANE Well you did a really good job. 
CUT TO: EXT. SAN FRANCISCO NORTH BEACH - DAY CU on the Waif. 
We widen, revealing the ENTIRE WORLD has been hijacked, blanketed by THE POSTERS. People gape -- astonished and captivated. 
Disconnected from it all, strolling alone, is Margaret. 
She is burdened by her own thoughts. 
Regretful... 
Across the street, she sees a GOTHIC CHURCH. She stares up, awed by the beauty. 
It's Catholic imagery in all its glory: Saints... 
Jesus... 
Mary... 
Suddenly -- the bells RING. Hm. Margaret takes a step... 
INT. CHURCH CONFESSION BOOTH - DAY Margaret tentatively enters and kneels. 
Beat -- then the grille OPENS. She reacts, discomposed. 
MARGARET Hello. 
I've -- never really done this before. 
I'm not sure how you... (WORRIED) I was raised Methodist. 
If it's a problem, I can go -- 37. 
She starts to stand. 
The Priest blurts out. 
PRIEST'S VOICE No, no! Please. 
We don't chase people away. (BEAT) What is troubling you? 
Margaret takes a breath. 
THEN -- MARGARET I lied to my child. 
Pause. 
PRIEST'S VOICE Why would you do that? 
MARGARET My husband... he pressured me into doing it. (PAUSE) I've never lied to her before. 
I'm not that kind of person. 
Beat. 
PRIEST'S VOICE Is your husband that kind of person? 
MARGARET Ummm, no. 
I don't think of him that way. 
I mean, he likes to tell stories... maybe he exaggerates a little... but he's a good man. (SHE THINKS) He takes care of us. 
He wants to make enough money to buy our family a house... 
PRIEST'S VOICE But what of the child? 
Will this lie bring harm to her? 
MARGARET "Harm"?? 
Oh! Not at all. (BEAT) I'm just looking for answers... 
The Priest considers this. 
PRIEST'S VOICE Well, the modern world is a complicated place. (MORE) 38. 
PRIEST'S VOICE (CONT'D) Occasionally, children need to be sheltered from certain truths. 
MARGARET N-no. 
That's not what -- PRIEST'S VOICE It sounds like your husband is trying to make the best of an imperfect situation. (BEAT) You were raised Christian, so you know what we are taught: The man is head of the household. (BEAT) Perhaps you should trust his judgment. 
CUT TO: INT. KEANE GALLERY - NIGHT Opening night! The gallery is packed with the IN CROWD: Rich and drinking. 
The space is cool -- the walls bright white, the art hanging under spotlights. 
JAZZ plays on the stereo. 
At one painting, a HIPSTER COUPLE stares at the image of a sorrowful girl holding an armful of poodle puppies. 
HIPSTER LADY I think it's creepy, maudlin and amateurish. 
HIPSTER MAN Exactly. 
I love it. 
We move in tight on the painting. 
Underneath is a tag: "BEDTIME, by WALTER KEANE. Oil on canvas." We drift along, to another painting: "CALICO CAT, by WALTER KEANE." Then, another: "IN THE GARDEN, by WALTER KEANE." Every painting is now by Walter Keane. 
We move along... finding the Tipsy Man chatting up Dick. 
TIPSY MAN We got in early. 
We own three. (HE TURNS) Thanks, doll. 
He tosses his empty to a PASSING LADY. We reveal the waitress is... 
Margaret. 
She carries a tray of pigs-in-a-blanket. 
Margaret looks shell-shocked -- faking a happy party face. 
A burst of LAUGHTER. Margaret turns. 39. 
Walter and a group ROAR at a joke. 
A SEXY GIRL hands Walter one of the promo posters. 
He beams and lays it across her back... hugging her waist to "steady" himself as he signs. 
BACK ON MARGARET She frowns. 
Dee-Ann slides into view, slurping champagne. 
DEE-ANN Hey, baby! Killer party! It's a hap- pen-ing...! So, where's your stuff? 
MARGARET (NERVOUS) Oh. Um, we decided that this would be Walter's show -- DEE-ANN (SUSPICIOUS) Oh "we" did?? 
And why would "we" do that?? 
MARGARET Well... he's more established. 
DEE-ANN Please! Is that you talking, or did you just turn into a little felt puppet with someone's hand up your ass? 
Margaret is befuddled. 
Dee-Ann scopes out the artwork. 
DEE-ANN It's strange... 
Walter doesn't strike me as the cute hungry kitten type... 
Margaret grimaces. 
MARGARET Thanks for coming. 
Margaret grabs a drink and hurries away. 
Dee-Ann stands there, irked. 
Margaret cuts over to Walter. 
We MOVE IN TIGHT ON THE COUPLE. He grins and grabs her. 
WALTER Ah, my sweet! Are you enjoying the scene? (he gives her a kiss) EVERYONE! (MORE) 40. 
WALTER (CONT'D) Give a hand to my beautiful wife. 
Without her, none of tonight would be possible! The crowd APPLAUDS politely, condescendingly. 
Margaret smiles strangely. 
The Tipsy Man leans in. 
TIPSY MAN Your husband's quite a talent. (PLEASANT) Do you paint, too? 
Margaret freezes up, terribly awkward. 
MARGARET I don't... know. 
AT WALTER A NOSY GUY corners him in front of a painted child. 
NOSY GUY I'm curious about your technique. 
How long did that piece take to execute? 
WALTER That? 
Oh, wow. 
Probably... months. 
First the thinking, the sketching, and then time with just me and the oils. 
NOSY GUY "Oils"? 
But isn't that acrylic...? 
Huh? 
Walter glances at the painting, startled. 
WALTER Oh --! You mean that painting! Uhh, sorry! It's like a jumble of ideas, rattling around in my brain! Beat. 
NOSY GUY So where do you get your ideas? 
WALTER What do you mean? 
NOSY GUY I mean -- (confused at this confusion) Why are they... images of children? 
Yikes. 
Walter starts to sweat. 
He didn't think this through. 41. 
WALTER Well, er, I've just always loved kids. 
Though mostly I was influenced by my darling daughter... 
An odd beat. 
WALTER I remember when she was a baby... 
Walter gets a far-off look. 
WALTER Yeah. 
Cute little thing. 
I'd stare into those big orbs. 
Sometimes I'd get out my Brownie and snap a photo... but... that's not subjective. 
You know? 
It doesn't capture your feelings. 
So that's when I started painting her... 
We hold on Walter, unsure where reality begins and ends... 
CUT TO: INT. BERKELEY APARTMENT - DAY CU on a fuzzy TV SCREEN: A PRIGGISH MAN is griping. 
The screen is captioned "JOHN CANADAY, NY TIMES ART CRITIC" CANADAY (ON TV) Keane's work is completely without distinction. 
He is not a member of the Society of Western Artists. 
He has won no awards. 
He's only noteworthy for his appearances in a certain newspaper's gossip column! (EXASPERATED) Mr. Keane is why society NEEDS critics! To protect them from such atrocities! Walter gapes at the TV, outraged. 
He suddenly grabs a PHONE. IN THE LIVING ROOM Jane is BANGING on a closed door. 
JANE Mom! I wanna come in. 
MARGARET (O.S.) Uhh, you can't. 
Mommy's busy. 
JANE (she BANGS again) Let me in! What are you doing in there? 
Why's the door always locked? 42. 
Walter enters -- and reacts. 
He glides over to the girl. 
WALTER Janie, sweetie, you need to respect your mother's privacy. 
Sometimes grownups need alone time. (HE WINKS) Is that the ice cream truck? 
Why don't you go get yourself a fudgesicle? 
Walter tosses her a dime. 
She peers warily, then leaves. 
He waits a beat -- then pulls out a KEY. Walter discreetly unlocks the painting room. 
INT. APARTMENT PAINTING ROOM - SAME TIME It's a factory. 
Big Eyes are everywhere. 
Margaret frenziedly works, surrounded by half-done canvases, solvents, easels. 
She's in a bathrobe -- a cigarette hanging from her lips. 
Startled, she looks up to see Walter. 
He gazes at all the art. 
At the bulbous faces, eyes watery and submissive, trapped in muddy yellows and dire browns. 
And then... 
Walter grins broadly. 
WALTER Whew! Out of this world...! MARGARET (BOTHERED) I dunno. 
I'm not really comfortable with this. 
Jane and I used to be so close... but -- now... 
WALTER Ah, Jane's grand! She's eating ice cream! She has new shoes. 
She has a college fund. 
Beat. 
MARGARET Maybe I'm lightheaded from the turpentine. 
I've been in here all day. 
WALTER Well I don't want you feeling like a prisoner. 
Take a break! Walter glances at one PAINTING -- then does a take. 
ANGLE - PAINTING It's a child in a rusty alley, staring, aching for compassion. 
And, starting to cry. 
A single tear streams down her cheek. 43. 
WALTER Is that a tear...? 
You've gone deep! Margaret bites her fingers, worried. 
MARGARET Do you -- like it? 
WALTER I love it! ...How'd you get the eyes so lifelike? 
Is it the highlights? 
MARGARET (PROUD) No. The secret is the shadow. 
I shadowed the eyelid. 
Margaret smiles shyly. 
Walter smiles back, full of warmth. 
He takes her face in his hands. 
WALTER I owe you an apology. 
I was initially dismissive of your kids, those emotion- wrenching blobs of humanity... but they have a real strength. 
MARGARET (SHE LAUGHS) Is that your best version of sincerity? 
WALTER I'm trying! Ah, you know me. 
See -- this is why I need your help! I want to go on tv, to defend our art. 
MARGARET You're going to be on television?! WALTER Yes! But... what will I say?? (BEAT) Meaning -- what compels me... to paint... these paintings?? 
A bizarre pause. 
The two of them look around the room. 
At all the Big Eyes peering down at them. 
MARGARET Maybe you have an unhealthy obsession with little girls. 
WALTER Cute. 44. 
MARGARET (SHE SNICKERS) I guess you've painted yourself into a corner. 
WALTER Funny! Keep 'em coming! You're a regular Steve Allen. 
You want heat this winter? 
Help me out! MARGARET Walter... art is personal. 
Walter picks up a picture of TWO LITTLE GIRLS IN TUTUS. He stares, perplexed. 
WALTER What would make a grown man paint a picture like this?! No answer. 
He thinks of stories, wheels spinning. 
WALTER I grew up, surrounded by six sisters. (NO GOOD) I grew up in an orphanage? (STRUGGLING) I grew up... in a world where adults had vanished, and children and kittens ran wild over the desolate landscape! Margaret smiles. 
MARGARET What about your Paris street scenes? 
Why do you paint those? 
WALTER Well, because... 
I lived it! I experienced it! MARGARET (calling his bluff) And was it really all sun-dappled streets and flower vendors? 
Huh? 
Walter stares off at the Waifs. 
They peer out from broken windows... chain-link fences... 
And then -- he gets it. 
WALTER Well -- NO! Of course not. 
It was after the War. 
There was destruction everywhere... (PAUSE) (MORE) 45. 
WALTER (CONT'D) I traveled the Continent. 
The ravages were horrifying... 
CUT TO: INSERT - FULL FRAME TV SCREEN Walter is on TV, on a LOCAL PUBLIC AFFAIRS SHOW. He's coated with makeup, sitting rigidly, fingers gripping his chair. 
WALTER (ON TV) My psyche was scarred in my art student days. 
Nothing in my life has ever made such an impact as the sight of the children: War-wracked innocents, without homes, without parents, fighting over garbage... 
He sits in a half-circle of PROPER WOMEN, who are spellbound. 
WALTER (ON TV) Goaded by a frantic despair, I sketched these dirty, ragged little victims... with their bruised minds and bodies, their matted hair and runny noses. 
There my life as a painter began in earnest. 
Walter sadly looks up to the HOST. The man is shellshocked. 
Mute. 
Walter waits, then sighs. 
WALTER (ON TV) The insane, inhuman cruelty inflicted upon these children cut deeply into my being. 
From that moment on, I painted the lost children with the eyes. 
Those eyes that forever retained their haunting quality. 
The ladies are stricken. 
A few dab their eyes. 
CUT TO: EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - DAY Keane posters get RIPPED off a wall. 
RIPPED off a mailbox. 
PULLED off a construction site! EXT. KEANE GALLERY - NEXT DAY Walter strides along, a bounce to his step. 
He reaches the gallery -- then stops, dumbfounded. 
It's PACKED with PEOPLE! Not rich, but regular folks, gawking at the art. 46. 
Wow. 
A sweet moment... then some TOURISTS see Walter and happily accost him: "Walter Keane!" "Mr. Keane!" They thrust papers and POSTERS at him to autograph. 
Walter grins and scribbles his signature. 
Glancing over their shoulders, he sees Ruben down the block, standing outside his own gallery. 
Gaping in disbelief. 
Walter chuckles... then flips him off. 
Ruben's face falls. 
INT. KEANE GALLERY - SAME TIME Walter pushes through, shaking hands, greeting the CUSTOMERS: WALTER Good afternoon! Delighted! (he reaches the SEXY BLONDE CLERK and pinches her ass) How many sales today? 
BLONDE CLERK "Sales?" None with this crowd. 
Walter's smile drops, surprised. 
BLONDE CLERK These people are looky-loos! They can't afford the paintings. 
But we gave away a heap of posters! Huh? 
Walter peers, baffled. 
Suddenly -- a loud FRWWIPPPP! Walter whirls, startled. 
Outside, two GIRLS tear a big poster off the front window. 
Walter's eyes widen. 
Slowly, he turns back. 
At the counter, FOLKS and KIDS are grabbing free posters from a box. 
Walter stares. 
Processing this. 
And then... being struck by an idea of absolute genius... 
INT. STORAGE ROOM - SECONDS LATER Walter is on the telephone, peering through the doorway. 
Hiding from the customers. 
Spying. 
WHISPERING. WALTER (ON THE PHONE) It's the craziest thing. 
I started charging for the posters! First a nickel... then a dime. (struggling to whisper) YES, Maggie! It's cuckoo! So it got me thinkin': Would you rather sell a $500 painting, or a million cheaply- reproduced posters?! (he LAUGHS, exultant) (MORE) 47. 
WALTER (ON THE PHONE) (CONT'D) See, folks don't care if it's a copy. 
They just want art that touches them! CUT TO: ANIMATION WALTER'S VOICE And then... we could sell it anywhere!! EVERYWHERE! 60's-style MADISON AVENUE GRAPHICS: A still of a HARDWARE STORE. Mops, light bulbs, then -- BING! -- framed KEANES. A PHARMACY. Aspirin, candy bars -- BING! -- framed KEANES. A GAS STATION. Tires, motor oil, and -- BING! -- KEANES. INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY An aisle of Sundries: Plastic toys, beach balls... 
Waifs. 
A sign says "WE HAVE KEANE!" Around the corner, Margaret shuffles along, listlessly buying banalities: Cereal. 
Soap. 
She turns the cart... and runs into her wall of teary-eyed kids. 
Margaret peers, muddled. 
Then she turns away -- to a RACK OF PAPERBACKS. They offer fast hope, inspiration. 
Margaret seems disconnected. 
She runs her hand down the options... a book of Numerology... a book on Judaism... an Edgar Cayce prophecies manual... 
AT THE REGISTER - Margaret gazes up. 
The CASHIER is a sad Beatnik Girl. 
In a haze, Margaret notices the whole market is full of LONELY WOMEN: One LADY is her doppelganger -- same age, blonde, gripping a cart. 
Next aisle over, a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN stares into space. 
Nearby, a YOUNG MOM wrangles her children. 
We shift to Margaret. 
Face gaunt. 
Eyes empty. 
Troubled... 
INT. APARTMENT PAINTING ROOM - DAY Curtains drawn, Margaret frantically SKETCHES. She's cabin feverish. 
In her robe. 
Hair dirty. 
And -- up to something. 
These sketches aren't squat children with round eyes. 
They're different: Figures with long lines. 
Margaret frowns and rips the paper. 
She tries again! Another angular figure -- straight fingers... no! Again! A woman... reclining. 
Then an indication of a face: A slash... and then -- two small almond shapes for eyes. 48. 
Hmm. 
Margaret's face brightens. 
She likes it. 
LATER Margaret rabidly paints. 
Spurting globs of color. 
The woman is blonde, almond eyes cool, lips curled with mystery... 
Margaret glances in a mirror. 
It's a self-portrait. 
It's Margaret, aloof. 
Alone at a table. 
Suddenly the door opens. 
Margaret GASPS, startled, and spins the canvas away. 
Walter barges in, dressed like a million. 
He HALTS -- making a sour face. 
WALTER Whew! Something smells in here. 
You should open a window. 
Margaret blinks, a bit dazed. 
MARGARET What time is it? 
WALTER I dunno. 6:30, 7? ...Didn't Janie get dinner? 
Margaret shrugs. 
Walter leans in. 
WALTER When's the last time you washed your hair? 
MARGARET I've been... busy. 
WALTER (he notices the turned canvas; he's intrigued) What do you got back there? 
Lemme see. 
MARGARET No --! It's just... something I'm working on. 
It's not for the world. 
Walter gives her a funny look. 
WALTER "The world"? 
Baby, it's me! (stepping forward, a bit MALEVOLENT) I'm your number one fan. 
MARGARET No, please! Walter, it's -- personal. 49. 
WALTER (GETTING CLOSER) But we're husband and wife. 
We shouldn't have secrets... 
Margaret gulps, fretting. 
Finally, without options -- she flips over the canvas of the lonely blonde. 
And -- Walter is taken aback. 
His eyebrows raise, shocked. 
Margaret bites her lip. 
Will he go ballistic? 
ANGLE - WALTER He leans right up to the painting. 
His expression is inscrutable. 
Studying the technique. 
We have no idea what his emotion is. 
WALTER It's a completely different style. 
MARGARET Yes it is. 
WALTER (BEAT) It looks like you. 
MARGARET It's a self-portrait. 
Beat. 
WALTER How am I gonna explain that? 
She shifts about. 
MARGARET I thought... maybe... 
I could sign it myself. 
Hmm. 
Walter's eyes narrow. 
WALTER That seems a bit confusing. "Keane" means me. 
MARGARET Yes, I know... but... when people ask me if I paint, I don't know what to answer! I just want the pride of being able to say -- that's mine. 
Walter's wheels are ratcheting. 50. 
WALTER Who'd you tell about the Big Eyes? 
MARGARET Nobody! WALTER (PARANOID) Was Dee-Ann here?! Did Dee-Ann see this painting?! MARGARET No! NOBODY saw it! WALTER You tell anybody, the empire COLLAPSES! Do you wanna give back the money? 
We've committed FRAUD! MARGARET I KNOW! My God! I live with this every minute of my life! (IMPASSIONED) Janie used to have a mother who painted. 
Now what's she think?! I lock myself in this room ten hours a day... and then you walk out with finished paintings! He scowls, offended. 
WALTER Janie thinks I'm in here, painting. 
MARGARET C'mon! You haven't picked up a brush in months! (starting to sob) We used to paint together! Easels next to each other, side-by-side -- WALTER That was the honeymoon period! Margaret breaks into tears. 
Walter tenses. 
WALTER Jesus, you're so fragile. 
MARGARET I've kept my end of the bargain! I've never told! (she SOBS harder) Please! Just let me have this! Walter recoils, unable to take this. 
He relents. 51. 
INT. APARTMENT LIVING ROOM - ANOTHER DAY Another PHOTO OP, but big: A CAMERA CREW rushes about. 
Lights get set-up. 
Walter, Margaret, and Jane work at easels. 
Walter dabs at a Big Eye. 
Margaret works on a sad, long-neck blonde. 
Jane paints a goofy flower, like any child. 
Dick Nolan takes notes. 
DICK So you're now called "The Painting Keanes"? 
WALTER Yep! Walter and his girls! With galleries in three cities! DICK I had no idea Margaret painted. 
WALTER Yeah, we don't talk about it. 
Sadly, people don't buy lady art. 
MARGARET (INTERJECTING) What about Georgia O'Keefe? 
Dick shakes his EMPTY GLASS, distracted. 
Walter points. 
WALTER The bar's over there. 
Dick goes to get a refill. 
Walter shoots Margaret a look. 
WALTER Yeah, Margaret's a superb artist, in her own way. 
I even steal a few tips from her, now and then! (HE CHUCKLES) Behind every great man is a great woman. 
DICK True true. 
So Margaret, where do you get your ideas? 
MARGARET (a bit tentative) Oh... from the world around me. 
And I love Modigliani's use of line. 
DICK ModiWHAT? The Italian joint? 52. 
WALTER Oh, for Christ's sake, Margaret! Dick writes a gossip column -- (BEAT) Let's stick to the family angle. 
Get a gander at little Janie over there! Walter steers Dick to Jane, cute at her little child's easel. 
WALTER What a talent! Look at these Keanes! If you cut open our veins, we bleed oil! Er -- turpentine. (AWKWARD) Uh, Dick, you know what I'm goin' for. 
Make it sound good. 
DING-DONG! It's the doorbell. 
Everyone turns. 
JANE Who's that? 
WALTER Ah! A little treat! The fourth member of the Painting Keanes! Margaret and Jane turn, confused. 
Walter whips open THE FRONT DOOR Revealing LILY, 10, a quiet girl in bobbed hair. 
She holds a little overnight bag. 
A Buick HONKS, and Walter waves as it drives away. 
Walter stares at the girl, then puts on big hammy airs. 
WALTER Lily, honey, how are you?! He gives her a giant hug. 
She responds stiffly -- a girl who doesn't see her father too often. 
LILY I'm fine, Dad. 
I lost a tooth. 
WALTER Really? 
Did you get in a fight? 
LILY (SHE LAUGHS) No. It fell out! ANGLE - MARGARET AND JANE They gape in bewilderment. 
Who the hell is this girl??! 53. 
BACK ON WALTER AND LILY Walter admires Lily's mouth. 
WALTER Well is the tooth fairy somethin' I gotta deal with, or did your mother already handle it? 
LILY (DRY) She handled it. 
WALTER Good! Good good! Well, just go throw your stuff in the kids' room, then you can come join the fun! Lily toddles out. 
ON THE GROUP Margaret and Jane are speechless. 
Walter acts like nothing bizarre has happened. 
Dick eyeballs all this with major curiosity. 
DICK Walter... you never told me you had another daughter. 
WALTER Didn't I? 
Sure. 
Lil's from my first marriage. 
Margaret struggles to hold her rage. 
Disoriented... 
MARGARET Walter? (URGENT) Walter! We need to speak. 
Margaret gestures: Get in the kitchen! He nods and follows. 
INT. KITCHEN Margaret shuts the door, then spins on him. 
MARGARET What is going on here??! WALTER That's Lily. 
I'm sure I mentioned her -- MARGARET No you didn't. 54. 
Margaret peers at him. 
How much can she trust? 
MARGARET Did she just move in?? 
WALTER No! Her mom's just going to Vegas for the weekend. (BEAT) I'm supposed to have her once a month, but I don't make her mom enforce it. 
TIGHT - MARGARET Her head is spinning. 
MARGARET How can you keep something so big a secret??? 
TIGHT - WALTER He starts to answer... then gives her a look: You are kidding? 
Walter squirms defensively. 
WALTER She's a sweet girl. 
MARGARET (HISSING) I'm sure she is. 
WALTER I put up with your daughter. 
I never said a peep. 
Margaret's jaw drops. 
MARGARET I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that. 
WALTER I'm sorry. 
Sorry! Please... let's just try to get through this. 
CUT TO: INT. JANE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT Jane's room, cute with stuffed animals and troll dolls. 
Lily is in the corner, awkwardly unpacking her bag. 
Trying not to impose on Jane's space. 
The girls peer at each other. 
LILY Dad told me you had a bunk bed. 55. 
Jane shakes her head. 
She feels bad. 
JANE Take the bed. 
I can sleep on the FLOOR -- LILY No, that's not fair! The floor's fine for me. 
Jane smiles nervously. 
She stares at this new girl. 
JANE Do you live far away? 
LILY I guess... about a twenty minute drive. 
JANE (STARTLED) "Twenty minutes"?! That's close! Jane blinks, confused. 
JANE But you never see Walter? 
LILY No, I see him all the time! He comes up and visits every week. 
Jane is taken aback. 
Lily sees this. 
LILY Doesn't he talk about me? 
JANE (LYING) Huh? 
Uh... sure. 
I guess a little. 
Jane thinks, fretting. 
JANE Does he talk about me? 
LILY (LYING) Uh... yeah. 
Sometimes. 
JANE (PLEASED) So what's your mom like? 
LILY She's pretty. 
She drives a Buick. 
She cries a lot. 56. 
JANE Yeah, mine's the same. (BEAT) Except she drives a Packard. 
Lily nods. 
Jane lowers her voice naughtily. 
JANE I have some peanut butter hidden in my sock drawer. 
Do you wanna eat it? 
Lily smiles: Sure. 
Jane opens a drawer and removes a jar of Skippy. 
The two girls sit on the floor, happily eating the peanut butter with their fingers. 
CUT TO: EXT. KEANE GALLERY - NIGHT Klieg lights streak the sky! A crazed CROWD is packed INSIDE. A big sign announces: "NOW APPEARING: AMERICA'S FIRST FAMILY OF ART - 'We paint truth and emotion.'" INT. KEANE GALLERY - NIGHT The place is filled with Big Eyes. 
Waifs waifs waifs! Cash registers RING. Money changes hands. "Sold" stickers go up. 
Walter works the room. 
WALTER Yeah, Walter Keane and Gauguin have a lot in common. 
They both walked away from successful careers to travel the globe, live on a boat... 
We move... finding Margaret alone in a small ANNEX. It displays a few of her sad blondes, alongside Jane and Lily's paintings of flowers and Mr. Potato-Head. 
Margaret sits, seeming like an adult at the children's table. 
An urbane RICH MAN glides by... and is taken with one of Margaret's nubile blondes. 
He gazes at the lounging figure. 
Margaret sits up. 
Alert, pleased with his interest. 
She tingles. 
Then, happily excited, unable to hold it in: MARGARET I painted it! RICH MAN Really? (IMPRESSED) It's very evocative. ...Sensual... 
He smiles flirtatiously. 
She smiles shyly and shrugs. 57. 
He steps forward -- then peers closer at the painting. 
The SIGNATURE is a feminine scroll: "MDH Keane" RICH MAN "MDH"? You're so... mysterioso. 
MARGARET Yes, we don't use my name, since people don't take women's art seriously. (BEAT) "MDH" are my initials. 
And more! I'm interested in numerology... and as you know, seven is a very good number. 
RICH MAN (PUZZLED) Er... seven? 
MARGARET Luckily, my maiden name is Margaret Doris Hawkins! "M" is the 13th letter of the alphabet, "D" is 4, "H" 8! If you add up 1 and 3 in 13, that gives you 4, making 4 plus 4 plus 8 equals 16, then 1 plus 6 equals seven! The man's head is spinning. 
He's lost all interest. 
Across the room, Walter sees this debacle. 
He marches over. 
WALTER Psst! Maggie! Can I have a second? (he PULLS HER ASIDE) Good grief! What the hell are you babbling about?! Long division?? 
Could you please help the world and shut your mouth? 
You want just one number in his head: The sales price! Her face drops, hurt. 
Acquiescing. 
WATCHING THIS Two SNOBBY ARTISTS smirk and GROAN at this scene. 
SNOBBY ARTIST #1 Two nuts that fell from the same tree! It's insufferable. 
Why are we starving, while they print money? 
SNOBBY ARTIST #2 Because that nut's a genius! He sells paintings! Then he sells pictures of the paintings! Then he sells postcards of pictures of the paintings. 58. 
They stare bitterly. 
Then, a terrible, shameful idea forms: SNOBBY ARTIST #1 I'll bet I could bang one out in ten minutes. 
SNOBBY ARTIST #2 It wouldn't have the dopey sincerity. 
SNOBBY ARTIST #1 The customers won't notice... 
They peer sheepishly at each other... 
CUT TO: EXT. STORE WINDOW - DAY Ruben is walking past -- then stops, pained. 
A window display of Keane Big Eyes shares space with paintings of CUTESY KITTENS lapping up milk. 
We WIDEN, revealing a whole wall of rip-offs! All with odd anonymous signatures: "Gig." "Eve." "Igor." A cavalcade of WIDE-EYED ANIMALS AND KIDS... 
DANCING WITH GUITARS... 
DRESSED AS HOBOS... 
PLAYING IN PAJAMAS. But these children aren't sad. 
They're just... blank. 
Ruben gasps at the dead-eyed pictures. 
RUBEN Christ. 
It's a movement. 
CUT TO: INSERT - TELEVISION - FULL FRAME "The Tonight Show" opening CREDITS: ANNOUNCER (V.O.) It's "The Tonight Show!" With guests Jerry Lewis, the Everly Brothers, artists Walter and Margaret Keane -- The CHANNEL CHANGES: A children's toy commercial (STOCK). A tear-streaked, crying plastic DOLL, a flagrant Waif rip-off: FEMALE ANNOUNCER (V.O.) She's "Little Miss No Name," the doll with the tear. 
From Hasbro. 
The CHANNEL CHANGES: Spanish TELEVISION. A Keane painting gets hung in Madrid's National Museum of Contemporary Art. 
CUT TO: 59. 
INT. PAINTING ROOM - DAY The Margaret sweatshop is going full-blast. 
Canvases are everywhere: Melancholy MDH ladies. 
Woeful Keane kids. 
Even a portrait of Natalie Wood, copied from a photo. 
Margaret dips a tiny brush, quickly detailing the tear on a child's cheek... when the doorbell CHIMES. Hm? Margaret puts down her brush, wipes her hands, then hurries out. 
She opens the door... 
REVEALING THAT WE'RE IN A DIFFERENT HOUSE. A GIANT, PHENOMENAL 1960s EXTRAVAGANZA. INT. WOODSIDE HOUSE - SAME TIME Margaret runs across the marble floors, past the swooping, Modern lines of a California ranch... all-white furniture... a kidney-shaped pool glistening blue outside the glass... a cute TOY POODLE barking at the door. 
MARGARET Rembrandt, shush! In the foyer, Margaret opens the front door. 
And standing there is Dee-Ann. 
Dazzled. 
She laughs with surprise. 
DEE-ANN My God! I thought I misread the address. 
MARGARET Yeah. 
That driveway is long. (she giggles, embarrassed) Honestly, I can't believe I live here. 
Dee-Ann glides in -- then freezes, agape. 
DEE-ANN Whoa. 
MARGARET I know! Two acres, a pool, five BEDROOMS -- (PAUSE) Though I thought that was excessive, since there's only three of us here. 
DEE-ANN Three? 
I thought there were four. 
MARGARET What? (CONFUSED; BEAT) Oh -- you mean Lily! No, she doesn't really live with us. 
That was just in the articles. 60. 
DEE-ANN Crazy. 
A fake daughter... 
Dee-Ann's eyes take it all in. 
Astonished. 
DEE-ANN It's been so long since I've seen you. 
MARGARET I know. 
North Beach is 30 miles, but it might as well be 300... 
DEE-ANN You're probably busy, hanging out with your new rich buddies. (BARBED) "Kim Novak." MARGARET Oh, please! She's Walter's friend. (a quiet shrug) He brings people by... the Beach Boys were here. 
But, it's pretty isolated. 
Dee-Ann goes silent. 
Margaret seems dwarfed by the house. 
MARGARET Jane has nice friends. 
Sometimes I pick them up at the junior high, and we all get pizza. (AWKWARD) But she's busy... 
Are you hungry? 
DEE-ANN I'm thirsty. 
MARGARET Good! I'll whip us up two gin fizzes. 
Margaret forces a smile and scurries behind a giant curved wet bar. 
She pulls out ingredients: Gin, lemon juice, soda... 
MARGARET When we moved in, I thought a wet bar was extravagant... but it's surprising how much use you can get out of it. 
Dee-Ann watches the drinkmaking. 
DEE-ANN How's Walter? 
MARGARET He couldn't be happier. 
He has everything he ever dreamed of. 61. 
DEE-ANN And so do you! Fabulous. 
Dee-Ann smiles archly. 
She glances away -- and notices Margaret's STUDIO, the door half-open. 
DEE-ANN Oh, is that your studio? 
Margaret turns -- and gasps. 
MARGARET No --! You can't go in -- DEE-ANN I just want a peek. 
See what the workspace of a wildly successful artist looks like -- MARGARET Dee-Ann, please! STOP -- Margaret rushes to block her -- but Dee-Ann pushes open the door, revealing... 
INT. PAINTING ROOM A room full of MDHs and Keanes. 
Dee-Ann stops, puzzled. 
She glances at Margaret -- who has turned white as a ghost. 
Immensely curious, Dee-Ann slowly enters. 
She peers around at the two styles of paintings... 
A strained silence. 
Finally, Margaret whispers. 
MARGARET W-Walter paints in here too. 
Hmm. 
Dee-Ann walks about, examining the canvases. 
Then, her gaze settles on the Big Eye that Margaret was working on. 
Below the easel is the wet brush on the open jar of paint. 
Margaret sucks in her breath. 
Dee-Ann sees this. 
DEE-ANN Is Walter home?? 
Margaret has no answer. 
The two friends look at each other... 
Dee-Ann waiting... wondering if Margaret is going to lie to her... 62. 
When..... 
SLAM! WIDE Both women startle. 
FOOTSTEPS. Then... 
Walter strides in! Margaret's eyes pop. 
Walter's pop even bigger. 
He glares at the ladies. 
WALTER What the hell's going on here?!! MARGARET (TIMID) Uh... 
Dee-Ann was just... she... 
Margaret trails off. 
Walter thinks, then SNAPS. WALTER You KNOW I don't like anyone seeing my work before it's done! Walter rushes to the Waif, then for show grabs up the wet brush and quickly starts to "finish" the painting. 
Suddenly -- an odd expression crosses his face. 
He eyeballs the canvas, realizing he doesn't know what to do. 
A furtive glance. 
Then, unbowed, he hastily dips the brush and slaps a little black onto the shaded background. 
Walter spins, victorious. 
WALTER There! CUT TO: INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER The three sit silently, tension thick, sipping gin fizzes. 
Nobody speaks. 
Walter finishes his drink and pours a fresh one. 
CUT TO: INT. FOYER - NIGHT They are drunk and SCREAMING. Walter pushes Dee-Ann out the door. 63. 
WALTER You and your whole non-representational crowd are FRAUDS!! DEE-ANN SHUT UP! You're so full of shit, Walter! WALTER Get outta my house! My big house! (LIVID) Go back to sellin' your coat hanger sculptures on Fisherman's Wharf! DEE-ANN Fuck you! Dee-Ann staggers outside, then hops in her car. 
OUTSIDE Dee-Ann GUNS the engine and squeals away. 
The car peels down the very long driveway. 
Margaret and Walter watch the car disappear into the distance. 
Without looking over, Walter speaks. 
WALTER I don't want her ever invited here again. 
Margaret nods, terribly sad. 
MARGARET I won't. 
CUT TO: INT. MASTER BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT Margaret and Walter lie in bed, awake. 
Arms crossed. 
Unspeaking. 
EXT. WOODSIDE HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY Margaret and 13-YEAR-OLD JANE play on the lawn with the poodle. 
Jane laughs as the dog chases in circles. 
JANE Go, Rembrandt! Get the ball! She tumbles, and Rembrandt licks her ear. 
She giggles. 
MARGARET Okay, honey. 
I have to go work. 64. 
JANE Can I come? (an awkward silence) No. I can never come. 
No! I shouldn't even ask. 
Jane glares glumly. 
Margaret peers hopelessly at her daughter... then goes inside. 
INT. WOODSIDE HOUSE Margaret strolls to her studio. 
WE SEE the poodle scampering behind her on its cute little legs. 
She enters the INT. PAINTING ROOM Margaret doesn't notice the tiny dog follow her in. 
She LOCKS the door, then turns -- surprised. 
MARGARET Where did you appear from? 
Didn't you hear? 
No visitors! Rembrandt wags his tail, his little eyes bright. 
Margaret peers. 
MARGARET Is this what it's come to? 
You're the only living soul I can tell my secret? (she lowers her voice) Well -- I painted them all! (she shudders with release) It's TRUE! I did every single one -- She gestures, then catches sight of a Walter street scene. 
MARGARET Well, every one except that street scene. (BEAT) But I did the rest. 
Every Big Eye! And nobody will ever know. 
But YOU. Rembrandt pants and BARKS. Margaret chuckles, then goes to work. 
She pulls a CURTAIN across the sliding glass door. 
At her easel, she squirts a tube into a well and starts mixing colors. 
Rembrandt jumps on the couch. 
MARGARET No you don't! It's nice to have company, but that sofa is new. (she pushes him off) Let's find you some carpet to lay on. 65. 
Margaret goes over to a CLOSET. Rembrandt follows, curious. 
IN THE CLOSET Margaret turns on the bare bulb inside. 
It's filled with old easels... cans... junk... 
MARGARET I think there's a scrap back here... 
She rummages, sliding the junk aside. 
In back is a TATTERED WOODEN CRATE. Hm? MARGARET Well what's this? 
Margaret swings the bulb closer. 
The crate is covered with SHIPPING INSTRUCTIONS and international markings. 
Margaret's interest is piqued. 
She tugs at the lid, pulling it off. 
Revealing inside a STACK OF STREET SCENE PAINTINGS. Ten or fifteen of Walter's canvases. 
Or so it seems. 
TIGHT - MARGARET She peers closer. 
TIGHT - THE PAINTINGS The top painting is a typical Parisian street scene: Cobble stones, a man carrying baguettes, an old lady selling roses... 
But down in the bottom corner is the signature: "S. 
CENIC" TIGHT - MARGARET She sucks in her breath, shocked. 
She examines the painting. 
Then, she hurriedly grabs the next canvas. 
It's another sunlit scene: A quaint Parisian cafe, a man playing accordian, and in the bottom right corner... the signature: "S. 
CENIC" WHAT?! Margaret grabs the next canvas. "S. 
CENIC" The next canvas. 
The next canvas! They all are signed "S. 
CENIC" Margaret starts hyperventilating. 66. 
She thinks, then suddenly bolts from the closet. 
INT. PAINTING ROOM Margaret races, rushing up to Walter's painted street scene, hung on the wall. 
We PUSH IN TIGHT, as she shoves her face up to the canvas, so close we can see the brushstrokes -- As we MOVE IN TO THE SIGNATURE. Simply, "W. 
KEANE" Margaret's face is flushed. 
She gazes at the name... then rushes back to her work area. 
She manically hunts: Brushes, tubes, rags -- and an EXACTO KNIFE. Ah! She runs back to Walter's painting. 
Heart pounding, she grazes the knife up against the signature, then DIGS. And -- the "W. 
KEANE" flecks off. 
Revealing... underneath... the name "S. 
CENIC" CLOSEUP - MARGARET She trembles, overcome. 
Music SWELLS. Her eyes spin back -- SERIES OF QUICK FLASHBACKS: Walter painting at the Palace of Fine Arts. 
His canvas is blank. 
Walter in the apartment, signing his name to a finished piece. 
Walter spattering paint on his clothes. 
Walter the day we met him. 
He shows off a rack of finished paintings at the Sunday Art Show. 
BACK ON MARGARET She collapses. 
CUT TO: INT. WOODSIDE HOUSE - THAT EVENING A grandfather clock says 10:15. 
Margaret sits gloomily, staring at the clock. 
Clutching a drink. 
LATER 2:30 a.m. 
Margaret still stares at the clock. 
She's stewing. 
Suddenly, keys in the door. 
Walter swings in, tanked and full of life. 
He skids across the marble, humming to himself -- when -- he's startled by his wife. 
He jerks. 67. 
WALTER M-Maggie! What're you doin' up? 
Margaret glares. 
Not speaking. 
He shrugs. 
WALTER I had a helluva night. 
Worked three or four clubs. (he winks, loosey-goosey) Stumbled onto some hot gossip: Madame Chiang Kai-shek is coming to town! Straight from Taipei! I think we should present her with a painting -- get Dick to flack it... (HE THINKS) Or the heck with Dick. 
I met a new guy at UPI... 
MARGARET Maybe you should give her one of your street scenes. 
WALTER (HAZY) You think? 
I dunno -- I thought you could whip off a doodle of Chinatown. 
With a cute little kid, sort of a big- eyed slanty-eyed thing... 
Margaret's anger is raging. 
She glares, steely. 
MARGARET No, Walter. 
She's a dignitary. 
Doesn't she deserve a piece that comes straight from you? (SHARP) From your experience??? 
WALTER Yeah? 
Maybe you're right. 
She probably doesn't have a Parisian street scene hanging in her palace. 
Margaret nods, as if they've settled something. 
She turns to walk away -- then suddenly SPINS. MARGARET Unless Madame Chiang Kai-shek already has a Cenic. 
ON WALTER He freezes up. 
Suddenly sober, smacked to reality. 68. 
WALTER "Cenic"...? 
Uh, what's that? 
Margaret stares, eyes sharp. 
MARGARET Cenic is the name of the artist who did all your early paintings. 
WALTER Huhhh? (spinning his lie) Urgh... oh! CENIC! (he laughs crazily) Cenic was my nickname in Paris! All my art school pals loved my scenic views, so they called me "Scenic"! But since those Frogs can't pronounce a hard "e," I became "Cenic." He looks up at her hopefully. 
But she shakes her head. 
MARGARET The more you lie, the smaller you seem. 
WALTER (unyielding, scrambling) How DARE you accuse me of lying! I'm proud of my early Cenics! MARGARET Then why do you paint over the name? 
Walter gasps, floored. 
Margaret bores in. 
MARGARET A bit of advice: Don't use a water- base over an oil. 
It flecks off. 
Walter cowers. 
WALTER You sound crazy! For God's sake. 
You've... you've SEEN me paint!!!! MARGARET No, I haven't. (QUIET; STRONG) I always thought I had... but it's some kind of... mirage. 
From a distance you look like a painter, but up close... there's nothing there. 69. 
CLOSEUP - WALTER All life drains from his face. 
His eyes go glazed. 
He speaks mechanically. 
Tiredly... 
WALTER I studied art in Paris. 
I went to school at the Beaux-Arts. 
The Grand Chaumiere. 
I spent hours in the Louvre, gazing at the greatness of the Masters... 
MARGARET Walter? 
He turns. 
She winces, pained. 
MARGARET Have you even been to Paris? 
Walter blanches. 
He shakes, broken up. 
He looks away, then staggers to a chair. 
He falls into it. 
Trembling. 
Not able to look her in the eye... 
WALTER I wanted... 
I so wanted to be an artist. 
But -- it just never turned out good. 
Margaret stares, seething. 
Then, without comment, she storms away. 
She SLAMS the door shut. 
BANG! Walter doesn't move. 
CUT TO: INT. KITCHEN - NEXT MORNING Margaret makes Jane breakfast, scrambling up eggs. 
Jane glances over her shoulder -- and notices Walter in the living room, asleep on the couch. 
An awkward pause. 
Jane says nothing. 
INT. MASTER BEDROOM - LATER Margaret is making the bed. 
Straightening the pillows. 
In the b.g., Walter silently creeps into view. 
Shamefully standing in the doorway. 
Not speaking... 
Margaret knows he's there, but doesn't acknowledge his presence. 
Finally, without making eye contact -- 70. 
MARGARET I don't want you sleeping in this room any longer. 
I -- I can't keep living these lies. (SHARP) There's three extra bedrooms. 
Go pick one. 
He nods. 
INT. HOUSE - LATER Margaret sits, unmoving, trapped in the big house. 
Outside, a JAPANESE GARDENER trims the hedges. 
Margaret stares at the walls, a smothering Walter Hall of Fame: Framed magazine articles on Walter, smugly posed with the Waifs. 
She swallows, then gently opens a dresser drawer. 
Inside is an ORIGINAL WAIF from long ago. 
A small oil of Jane, when she was a toddler. 
Margaret stares... and then her face slowly crumbles. 
INT. PAINTING ROOM - DAY Margaret huddles with a SKETCHPAD. Rembrandt is at her feet. 
She's drawing. 
She looks up, as Walter anxiously enters. 
He's holding a drink. 
He clears his throat. 
WALTER What are you working on? 
MARGARET A new MDH. Something for me. 
It's about a woman trapped in an uncaring world. 
I call it, "Escape." Walter bites his lip, afraid to talk. 
WALTER I figured out a solution to our problems. 
MARGARET What? 
WALTER Teach me. (BEAT) Show me your tricks. 
Then you can pass off the Waifs, and we won't be lying anymore. 
She looks up in disbelief. 71. 
MARGARET And then -- YOU'LL paint them? 
WALTER Sure! Why not? 
MARGARET (OFFENDED) Walter, this isn't paint-by-numbers! You think it's easy?! It took me years to learn -- WALTER Y-you're right! (SHEEPISH) But you know me! I'm a quick study. 
And I've got the basics... 
He trails off, unsure where this is going. 
Trying to rouse her, Walter rushes to an easel and throws up a blank canvas. 
She eyeballs him. 
MARGARET If you knew the basics, you wouldn't be at the easel. 
You have to sketch it first! Walter tightens, feeling stupid. 
He lets go of the canvas. 
Margaret stares, deciding. 
Then, she tosses him a PAD. Walter catches it. 
Slowly, he crosses over... 
ANGLE - MARGARET AND WALTER They peer at each other, like a Mexican standoff. 
Then, he nervously picks up a pencil. 
WALTER So...? 
What's first? 
MARGARET I dunno. 
You tell me. 
You're the creator. 
He frowns. 
WALTER It's a -- Keane. 
MARGARET Oh, a Keane! How witty. (SARCASTIC) You know, when we met all those years ago, I never would've imagined in my wildest dreams that one day -- 72. 
WALTER YEAH YEAH! Point taken. 
I'm standing here naked and humiliated in front of you. 
Look... can we just do a crying child? 
She gazes at him. 
Fingering her pencil... 
Trying to jump-start things, he starts to draw a circle -- MARGARET How old is the subject? 
WALTER Huh? 
C'mon, it's a head -- MARGARET It matters! A young child's head is round. 
An older child's head is oval! He feels pressured. 
Hand shaking, he draws a crooked circle. 
WALTER The child is this old! (ANGRY) You're trying to make this difficult -- MARGARET NO I'M NOT! Every line is a decision! (IMPASSIONED) It's easy to talk about art, but it's not easy to MAKE art!! DISSOLVE TO: INT. PAINTING ROOM - MONTAGE: Margaret easily outlines a head, then two circles for eyes. 
Walter tries copying, but his eyes are misshapen. 
Again, Walter copies, but he's wobbly. 
Angry, he scratches it out. 
Margaret tries to help, guiding his hand. 
Insulted, he pushes her off. 
He CRUMPLES the page. 
NEW TACTIC: Walter grabs her sketch. 
He puts it on a LIGHT- TABLE. Despairing, he starts to trace it.. 
LATER Walter finally paints. 
We can't see the canvas, but he's very meticulous. 
His expression quite earnest. 
He adds a final flourish... and then... a flicker of pride crosses his face. 
He smiles. 73. 
We slowly MOVE AROUND... to REVEAL HIS PAINTING. And... it's... absolutely dreadful. 
Kindergarten quality. 
Walter stares. 
Then, he furtively glances at Margaret's work. 
Comparing... 
The realization slowly sinks in. 
He has no ability. 
A sadness swells into fury... and suddenly Walter GRABS HIS CANVAS and SMASHES IT AGAINST THE EASEL. CRASH!! The canvas SHREDS. The frame blasts into pieces! Walter spins. 
He glares at one of Margaret's finished Waifs... then explodes, even more enraged. 
HE PICKS UP MARGARET'S PAINTING AND STARTS TO SWING IT AT THE WALL -- MARGARET (O.S.) Walter!! Huh? 
He lurches, startled. 
ACROSS THE ROOM Margaret stares him down. 
Sweaty, chest heaving, Walter staggers towards her. 
His face scowls, untamed. 
He clenches his fist, like he might attack MARGARET -- Then -- he SCREAMS and smashes her CANVAS. BAM!!! The painting RIPS apart. 
Walter KICKS his foot through the remains, then spins and charges from the room. 
CUT TO: INT. KEANE GALLERY - DAY TOURIST FAMILIES mill about. 
Suddenly the door SLAMS open. 
Walter bolts in, wild-eyed. 
A bit deranged. 
The families gawk -- glancing from Walter to his photograph all over: "WALTER KEANE! THE WORLD'S TOP-SELLING ARTIST!" Walter ignores them. 
He rushes a buxom REDHEADED CLERK. WALTER How's SALES? REDHEAD CLERK Oh, you know. 
Mondays -- Walter MUTTERS strangely. 
He snatches some paper and starts scribbling. 
Then he runs into the 74. 
STORAGE ROOM Walter agitatedly paces, circling the stacks of PRINTS. WALTER How many posters are back here? 
REDHEAD CLERK Exactly? 
I dunno, 3,000 or -- WALTER Does the printer owe us more? 
Do we owe him?? 
REDHEAD CLERK Uh, let me -- WALTER What about the OILS?! Are there more at the warehouse? 
REDHEAD CLERK Mr. Keane, I'd have to make a -- WALTER For the LOVE OF MUD! What am I PAYING you for? 
The girl freezes, rattled. 
Walter spins, flipping out. 
WALTER Hypothetical question: If you were a man, would you marry Kim Novak or my wife? 
What? 
WALTER Okay! Different question! If I got crippled and had to stop painting, how long before the gallery ran out of inventory and went belly up?? 
REDHEAD CLERK (RATTLED) Do you want a glass of water, Mr. Keane? 
Walter sighs. 
His thoughts drift away... 
WALTER What's it all mean? 
Why are we put on this earth? 
A 100 years from now, will people even know we existed...? 75. 
REDHEAD CLERK (UNCOMFORTABLE) I -- I don't understand. 
You'll always be famous. 
You were on the Jack Paar Show... (she glances away) Er, excuse me, sir. 
The girl hurries away, to ring up some customers. 
Walter silently watches. 
At the register, the Tourists buy a print. 
A "Madonna and Child," MDH-style. 
BAMMM! Walter's eyes bulge, like he's been stung. 
WALTER It's not even mine! It's one of hers. 
Aching, he staggers off. 
Sweating, woozy, he sits at a table. 
Distracted, he glances down at a newspaper... 
INSERT - NEWSPAPER There's an article on the 1964 NEW YORK WORLD'S FAIR. A headline says "CONSTRUCTION RACES TOWARD APRIL OPENING" TIGHT - WALTER His eyes narrow, piqued. 
World's Fair??? 
He leans in... 
CUT TO: INT. BISTRO - NIGHT A return to the charming bistro Margaret and Walter went to all those years ago, on their first date. 
The Maitre'd BEAMS. MAITRE'D Ah! Monsieur and Madame Keane! Delighted! Always such an honor! ANGLE on the Keanes. 
They are sullen. 
At wit's end. 
AT THE TABLE - LATER They stiffly sit at their old table. 
He snarls, eyes black. 
WALTER This doesn't change anything. 
MARGARET (trying to hold her ground) I know the truth. 76. 
WALTER Who cares?! This is all your fault! Maybe it's time to shake things up. 
Start puttin' my name on the MDH's. 
Margaret is astonished. 
A fury crosses her face. 
MARGARET NO! Absolutely NOT!! I still hate myself for giving you the Waifs! WALTER Quiet! Lower your voice -- MARGARET Oh, I'll talk as LOUD AS I WANT -- WALTER NO YOU WON'T! Or -- (FLAILING) I'll have you whacked! She jerks, flabbergasted. 
MARGARET What??! WALTER If you tell ANYONE, if you squeal, I'll take you out! I -- I know people. 
Remember Banducci's cousin? 
The liquor wholesaler? 
Pause. 
Margaret breaks into tears. 
MARGARET You're threatening me...?! Fine, kill me! My God, I've kept our secret for years! I've never once -- (CRYING) Do you know what it's been like for me? 
I don't have any friends. 
I've lied to my own child... 
Margaret shudders, distraught. 
Mascara runs down her cheeks. 
Walter squirms, uneasy with this. 
WALTER Christ, wipe your face! You look a mess. (BEAT) It's life imitating art! A crying Keane! He hands her his handkerchief. 
She dabs at her eyes. 
A looming quiet. 77. 
MARGARET What do you want, Walter? 
Everything with you is calculated. 
We're back where we had our first date... 
Walter's eyes widen. 
We MOVE IN TIGHT on them. 
He drops his voice. 
Dead serious. 
WALTER Look, I don't deny I need you. 
You're the one with the gift. (BEAT; HUSHED) Right now there's a shot... 
God, I'm shaking I'm so excited. 
The New York World's Fair. 70 million visitors. 
Opening day, I unveil my MASTERPIECE! She is flummoxed. 
MARGARET What masterpiece? 
WALTER Exactly! What have I been missing all this time?! Da Vinci has his Mona Lisa... 
Renoir has his Boatmen's Lunch... but where's my defining statement? 
MARGARET You sound insane. 
Artists don't announce a masterpiece -- WALTER Why not?! Didn't Michelangelo know he was hittin' a homer, when he was on his back painting the Sistine Chapel? 
MARGARET He worked on that for FOUR YEARS! WALTER Posterity, baby...!! She empties her drink. 
WALTER And here's the best part. 
It's for Unicef! Unicef is sponsoring the Hall of Education. 
Aw, we can finally give back to the children of the world!! Margaret stares, wavering... 
CUT TO: 78. 
STOCK FOOTAGE: The 1964 WORLD'S FAIR READIES TO OPEN. Men on 109 cranes hammer away. 
Fantastic, futuristic pavilions rise. 
The Hall of Education gets erected... 
INT. PAINTING ROOM - DAY ANGLE - An INSANELY BIG, BLANK CANVAS. It's 8 feet across, filling half the room. 
Margaret is in the throes of hastily creating the MASTERPIECE. Sketches are tacked everywhere. 
Margaret is chain smoking, sleep-deprived. 
The DESIGN is a staggering multiracial CROWD of children, mournful, extending to the horizon. 
Walter enters, silently scrutinizing. 
MARGARET It's too big. 
Why'd you promise them Cinerama size? 
WALTER Because it has to encompass all children. 
All races! One hundred stricken faces! Marching to infinity! The ultimate Walter Keane! (BEAT) At least that's what I told Life Magazine. 
Margaret ignores this. 
Walter does a rehearsed turn. 
WALTER Oh, a publisher says it's good timing to put out a coffee table book. 
You know, classy: "Tomorrow's Masters." (AWKWARDLY "CASUAL") So they need my... uh, early portfolio. 
My artistic evolution... 
Margaret's eyes pop. 
That's it. 
We PUSH IN... as she struggles to contain her frustration. 
Suddenly -- she SNAPS. MARGARET You're right! Where are your preliminary sketches?? 
All that time in art school, and somehow we waylaid your youthful experiments! The half- finished charcoals, the struggles... 
WALTER (a bit off-balance) I know you're being sarcastic, but these are all good ideas. 
Berlin war orphans... early self-portraits... 79. 
Her eyes narrow. 
MARGARET Get out of here. 
I'm trying to work. 
She brusquely spins away, back to the canvas. 
He shoots her an uncertain, dirty look. 
What just happened? 
CUT TO: INT. HOUSE - NIGHT Teenage Jane wanders through the house. 
Shouting. 
JANE Mom, what's for dinner? (NO RESPONSE) Mom! Are you home...? 
Nothing. 
No sign of Margaret. 
Jane tries the door of the PAINTING ROOM. As always, it's locked. 
Hm... 
Jane sneakily glances around. 
Opportunity. 
Quickly, she stands on a chair and reaches above the door sill. 
She feels around... and finds a KEY. Ah! Hurriedly, Jane UNLOCKS the door and lets herself in. 
INT. PAINTING ROOM - SAME TIME The room is a madhouse of WAIFS. Jane takes it all in. 
Her face darkens. 
Then, heavy breathing. 
She turns. 
Margaret is asleep, curled up under the almost-finished Masterpiece. 
Jane leans in. 
Slowly, Margaret rouses -- then suddenly: MARGARET W-what are you doing in here --? (BLINKING; HALF-AWAKE) This is -- Walter's studio! (DISCOMBOBULATED) You have to leave! Jane peers sadly at her mother. 
JANE Mom... 
I know. 
MARGARET Jane, you don't know anything!! Jane's face tightens. 
Insulted. 
JANE I'm not a child anymore. 80. 
Angry, Jane runs out. 
Margaret stares after her -- completely remorseful. 
She knows she did the wrong thing. 
Suddenly, she runs after Jane and grabs her tightly. 
Overcome, Margaret starts weeping. 
Jane starts crying too. 
CUT TO: INSERT - LIFE MAGAZINE A gargantuan spread. 
The LIFE ARTICLE is titled "The Man Who Paints Those Big Eyes." We PULL OUT... 
INT. NEW YORK TIMES - DAY Starchy John Canaday reads the article, gaping in utter disbelief. 
His desk says "JOHN CANADAY, SENIOR ART CRITIC." He also has Walter's BOOK, "Tomorrow's Masters Series." We WIDEN, revealing he's in the busy New York Times NEWSROOM. CANADAY Four... five... 
SIX pages! Is there something here I'm missing? (UPSET) He's like -- the Hula-Hoop! He just won't go away...! He flips a page -- then his jaw drops. 
CANADAY "Will be unveiled in the Grand Pavilion of the Hall of Education... internationally celebrated artist has been selected... will represent the aspirations of children worldwide --" (HE GASPS) Oh this is ABSURD! He GRABS for his phone. 
INT. WORLD'S FAIR HALL OF EDUCATION - DAY A panel flicks, and the huge empty space lights up. 
It's overwhelmingly cavernous, a bright, freshly-painted Space Age spectacular. 
Up high hangs The Masterpiece and its 100 kids. 
A sign says "TOMORROW FOREVER." Below, two tiny figures walk in: Canaday and an obtuse CIVIC LEADER. Canaday stares up in horror. 
Utterly stupefied. 
CANADAY And WHO was on the selection committee? 
CIVIC LEADER Oh! Well there wasn't a "committee," per se. 
We just had a luncheon with me, Ed, Jerome, Jerome's wife... (MORE) 81. 
CIVIC LEADER (CONT'D) (HE THINKS) Though technically, we didn't invite submissions. 
Mr. Keane just contacted us directly! Canaday reacts, smoldering. 
INT. NEW YORK MANSION - DAY A STRING QUARTET PLAYS at a GRAND PARTY. It's completely fabulous -- an old-money mansion filled with stuffy BLUE BLOODS, all tuxes and gowns. 
In the doorway appear Walter and Margaret. 
They're dressed to kill. 
Walter's radiant -- but Margaret looks like she's about to emotionally disintegrate. 
Suddenly, he WHISPERS. WALTER Stop. 
Let us appreciate this moment. 
This is what we've worked toward our whole lives: Rarified air. 
Inside this house are the movers and shakers. 
Kennedys. 
Rockefellers. (MISTY-EYED) Until today, we've always been on the outside, looking in. 
But when we enter... we will belong. 
MARGARET I was happier selling paintings in the park. 
He gapes, appalled. 
WALTER You are one crazy bitch. 
Walter spins and grandly enters. 
He grabs two CHAMPAGNES from a server. 
WALTER So maybe you have problems with the choices we made... but -- c'mon! Wednesday, the World's Fair opens. 
Thursday, our book goes on sale! MARGARET Friday, I file for divorce. 
WALTER Aw, why are you always so miserable? (IRRITATED) Well, I'm gonna enjoy my afternoon! The HOSTESS is a bejeweled dowager. 
Walter makes a beeline. 82. 
WALTER Mrs. 
Teasdale! Walter Keane. 
I just want to thank you for hosting this absolutely enchanting soiree. 
Walter takes the woman's hand. 
She smiles stiffly, silently horrified. 
She glances around for help. 
She catches a SOCIETY MAN's eye, and he hurries over. 
SOCIETY MAN Hey, Keane. 
Have you seen the Times? 
WALTER Er, no. 
Honestly, I've been so busy all day preparing for this lovely -- SOCIETY MAN I think you should read the Times. 
The Man gestures. 
Perplexed, the Keanes follow him into a INT. DEN - SAME TIME The room looks like a hunting lodge. 
On the desk are all the DAILY PAPERS. Walter grabs the NEW YORK TIMES -- then gasps. 
INSERT - NEW YORK TIMES It's open to a reproduction of "Tomorrow Forever," above a scathing REVIEW. THE KEANES stare, then turn pale. 
INSERT - REVIEW A BLIZZARD of WORDS assaults us: "GROTESQUE" "APPALLING" "TASTELESS" "Lowest common denominator" MARGARET AND WALTER'S faces drop, terribly hurt. 
MARGARET How could anyone... say something so cruel? 83. 
WALTER (a seething fury) What do YOU care?! That's MY name being dragged through the mud! Walter CRUSHES the newspaper. 
He spins on the guy. 
WALTER Is he here? 
SOCIETY MAN Er... yes. 
Which is perhaps why it would be best for everybody if you -- Walter STORMS out. 
The guy futilely chases -- INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME Walter barrels in. 
The ROOMFUL OF GUESTS are all staring. 
WALTER WHO WROTE THIS SHIT? People cower. 
Walter scans the crowd... and spots a cluster. 
Ah-hah! There is Canaday. 
Possessed, Walter strides over. 
Canaday stares, defiant. 
It's tense -- until he clears his throat. 
CANADAY Mr. Keane, this is not the venue. 
Perhaps you'd like to write a letter to the editor. 
Walter's throat tightens. 
He steps right into the guy's face. 
Women GASP. Tension bristles -- like a fight's about to erupt. 
WALTER What are you afraid of?? (MALEVOLENT) Just because people like my work, that means it's automatically bad?? 
CANADAY No. But that doesn't make it art either. 
Walter shudders. 
Canaday asserts himself. 
CANADAY Art should elevate -- not pander! Particularly in a Hall of Education! WALTER (OFFENDED) You have no idea! (MORE) 84. 
WALTER (CONT'D) Why does a man become a critic --?? 
Because he can't create! You don't -- CANADAY Ugh! That moldy chestnut -- WALTER Don't interrupt! You don't know what it's like! To put your emotions out there, naked, for the world to see. 
CANADAY What emotions?! It's synthetic hack work! (he loses it) Your "masterpiece" has an infinity of Keanes -- which just makes it an infinity of kitsch! Crazed, Walter grabs a FORK off the buffet. 
He lunges, like he's about to STAB Canaday! WIDE Women SCREAM. A few MUSCULAR MEN start to break through, to help. 
WALTER looks around -- then quivers, realizing he's out of control. 
Shamed, he slowly drops the fork. 
People breathe a sigh of relief. 
MARGARET is mortified. 
This is all too awful. 
Silent, she watches Walter back out of the party... 
CUT TO: INT. WORLD'S FAIR HALL OF EDUCATION - DAY "Tomorrow Forever" gets TAKEN DOWN. Burly WORKMEN slide the painting into a huge WOODEN BOX. INT. KEANE HOUSE - NIGHT The house is dark. 
Walter is raging, in an alcoholic fury. 85. 
WALTER What's wrong with lowest common denominators?! That's what this country was built on!! He KNOCKS over a lamp. 
Crash! WALTER I'm gonna sue EVERYBODY! I'll sue that pansy critic! And the World's Fair! And -- Unicef! (CRAZED) Yeah! I'll take down Unicef, and all their precious little boxes of dimes! Walter RUSHES BY. In a dim alcove, we make out Margaret and Jane, huddled in the shadows. 
Jane looks up at her mother with wide, frightened eyes. 
Suddenly -- Walter LUNGES at them! They SCREAM, startled. 
WALTER But I can't sue you, can I? (in Margaret's face) You were the ultimate betrayal! You FAILED me with that painting! Suddenly, he pulls out a BOOK OF MATCHES. He lights a MATCH and waves it sinisterly -- WALTER You crossed over from sentimentality to KITSCH! He THROWS the match at them. 
JANE Ow! MARGARET STOP IT! He lights ANOTHER MATCH. WALTER You like making me look bad?? 
You enjoy people laughing at me??! He PUNCHES the wall, then tosses the match. 
Fwoosh! MARGARET Walter! He throws ANOTHER MATCH. 86. 
WIDE Margaret grabs Jane and starts running. 
They rush into the blackness. 
Walter squints woozily, then starts to CHASE -- INT. HALLWAY The ladies run for their lives. 
Violent THUDS behind them! Something SMASHES. Margaret reaches the Painting Room. 
She YANKS Jane inside, then SLAMS the door! Walter staggers up. 
WALTER LET ME IN! INSIDE THE PAINTING ROOM Margaret LOCKS the door. 
She backs away. 
INT. HALLWAY Walter tugs the door. 
He POUNDS it, crazed. 
WALTER Lemme in, you BITCHES!! INSIDE THE PAINTING ROOM Margaret and Jane shudder. 
All around them, Big Eyes stare down from above. 
INT. HALLWAY In his haze, Walter remembers the hidden key. 
Raging, he drunkenly pulls over the chair, then stands on it. 
But he's too wobbly -- and falls. 
Bam! WALTER Ow! INSIDE THE PAINTING ROOM Margaret hugs Jane. 87. 
JANE Mom, what are we gonna do??! Margaret thinks. 
INT. HALLWAY Walter laughs crazily and lights another MATCH. It flickers. 
WALTER You got all that paint and turpentine in there? 
Well I'm gonna burn you up! He pushes the lit match through the KEYHOLE. WALTER You're gonna blow like an atom bomb! INSIDE THE PAINTING ROOM The match drops on the floor -- then goes out, harmless. 
That's it. 
Margaret makes a decision. 
MARGARET We're leaving. 
Determined, Margaret runs to the curtained wall. 
She whips it aside -- revealing the sliding glass doors. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER Walter is lighting another match -- when he spins. 
Through rheumy eyes, HEADLIGHTS orbit across the front window. 
He peers, confused... 
CUT TO: INT. CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT Margaret and Jane drive fast. 
Adrenaline pumping. 
Lights of the city flash across their faces. 
MARGARET I'm sorry I wasn't the mother I could have been. 
I -- I should have done this years ago... 
JANE But where are we going? (FLUMMOXED) We don't even have any clothes! 88. 
MARGARET Where we're going, we won't need much. (LONG PAUSE) Hawaii. 
Jane freezes, not sure whether to believe. 
JANE Really...? 
Margaret smiles softly. 
We slowly PUSH IN to her. 
MARGARET Yes, Hawaii. 
Because it's paradise. 
There's flowers, and birds, and beautiful colors. (GENTLE) And... we're going to make a new life for ourselves. 
DISSOLVE TO: EXT. HAWAIIAN HOUSE - DAY Hawaii, paradise indeed. 
A dense, tropical forest of deep greens and giant blooming flowers. 
Margaret stands on the porch of her small, lovely house, breathing in the clean air. 
She looks lightened. 
In a clearing, Jane plays with some LOCAL TEENS. INT. HAWAIIAN HOUSE - SAME TIME The house is simple. 
In one light-filled corner is an EASEL. Margaret is painting Nature: Splaying ferns. 
Wild succulents. 
In the window, a BIRD flies by, its plumage a dazzling red. 
Margaret thinks -- then takes out a tube of RED PAINT. She starts to apply the vivid color onto her canvas... 
When -- a RINGING PHONE. Margaret reacts, startled. 
This is unexpected. 
And unsettling. 
It RINGS. RINGS. RINGS. Finally, she hurries to her one telephone, mounted on the kitchen wall. 
She slowly answers it. 
MARGARET Hello? 
WALTER (O.S.) Maggie --? 
She freezes. 
INTERCUT: 89. 
WALTER ON THE PHONE - WOODSIDE He is strangely controlled and forboding. 
WALTER Boy, you were sure hard to track down. 
Thought I might never find you... (a menacing chuckle) I'm a little agitated. 
I got the strangest papers in the mail today. 
Margaret tries to stay cool. 
MARGARET It's a decree of legal separation. 
I would appreciate if you signed it. 
WALTER Aren't you acting too rash? 
MARGARET Walter, our marriage is over. 
WALTER Granted, our romance may have seen its better days. 
The bloom is off the rose. (BEAT) But I'm looking out for both of us. 
What about Keane Incorporated?! We're a professional couple. 
Like Roy Rogers and Dale Evans. 
MARGARET Walter, I want a divorce. 
WALTER Whew. 
It hurts to hear you say those words. 
Silence. 
He is feigning "hurt feelings." Struggling for a response. 
Finally, his thoughts sharpen up, smart and shrewd. 
WALTER I sure hate that it's come to this. (BEAT) Well... 
I SUPPOSE I can agree to a split -- as long... as you assign me all rights to every painting ever produced. 
MARGARET If that's the price. 
WALTER Really?! 90. 
Walter is surprised. 
Greedy, calculating, he wonders if he can push her further... 
WALTER Uh -- okay. 
And... then, we have to consider future revenue stream. 
MARGARET My God, Walter! How much more money do you need? 
WALTER It's -- the marketplace! I gotta stay fresh. 
Surely you understand? (DEADLY) You want me out of your life, here's my term: You'll have to paint me 100 more waifs. 100 more Walter Keanes! Margaret's face drops, pained. 
But she doesn't object. 
CUT TO: EXT. HAWAIIAN HOUSE - DAY Margaret loads BUNDLED, WRAPPED PAINTINGS into a dusty pickup truck. 
Jane comes running by, barefoot. 
MARGARET Would you like to go into town? 
I'm stopping by the post office. 
JANE No, I'm gonna surf with the gang. 
Margaret tightens up. 
MARGARET Your friends are a bit... wild. 
JANE (SHE SNAPS) Loosen up, Mom! You're impossible! You move me all the way to Hawaii. 
Then I actually make some friends, and all you do is complain about them. (CUTTING) Maybe you need to make some. 
MARGARET Y-you know I can't have people over to the house. 
JANE That's right! Or they'd see the precious paintings!! 91. 
Margaret has no response. 
Jane runs off. 
INT. HAWAIIAN HOUSE - DAY Margaret is alone, pouring a drink. 
She mixes in some ice -- then sees something odd. 
OUTSIDE THE WINDOW Coming down the long driveway are two FIGURES. Two small WOMEN, patiently walking toward the isolated house. 
Margaret stares, puzzled. 
The women come closer. 
They are Asian, dressed in formal dresses. 
Curious, Margaret creeps over, spying on them... 
They walk up and ring the bell. 
DING-DONG! An unsure beat... then Margaret opens the door. 
The ladies smile politely. 
ASIAN LADY #1 Hello. 
We're visiting everyone in this neighborhood with an important message. 
No doubt you're busy, so we'll be brief. 
Huh? 
Margaret stares at them deadpan, highball in her hand. 
ASIAN LADY #2 We have something to share with you about the wonderful things that God's Kingdom will do for mankind. 
Margaret's face darkens. 
MARGARET I'm not interested. 
She starts to close the door... but they continue. 
ASIAN LADY #1 Do you mean that you are not interested in the Bible, or in religion in general? 
MARGARET I'm not interested in whatever you're selling. 
The lady glances at Margaret's glass. 
She smiles gently. 
ASIAN LADY #2 But we're not selling anything. 
We're just here to share the good news. 92. 
MARGARET (DOUR) From where I'm standing, I don't see much good anywhere. 
Just a lot of pride, and thievery, and people treating each other poorly. 
ASIAN LADY #2 Yes! Exactly! That is the good news! What? 
Margaret is lost. 
The ladies grab the opening. 
ASIAN LADY #1 Bad things in the world are a sign. 
They show us that earthly Paradise is at hand. 
ASIAN LADY #2 Do you know what it says in Timothy 3:1-5? (she pulls out a BIBLE and quickly thumbs to a page) "In the last days, critical times hard to deal with will be here. 
For men will be lovers of themselves. 
Lovers of money. 
Self-assuming, haughty, blasphemers, disobedient --" MARGARET Sounds like my ex-husband. 
Margaret laughs. 
Surprised, the women laugh, too. 
Margaret peers at them. 
At their Bible. 
MARGARET Would you like to come in? 
CUT TO: LATER The three women sit. 
Margaret gazes... 
MARGARET It's been so long since I've been happy. 
But, I don't even know why I'm telling you... two complete strangers. 
ASIAN LADY #1 It's our mission to comfort those in mourning. 
Jehovah wants us to help the brokenhearted. 
MARGARET So you're -- Jehovah's Witnesses? 93. 
The ladies nod. 
Margaret thinks. 
MARGARET I've explored so many religions. 
But they all had their flaws... 
ASIAN LADY #2 Then they're wrong for you. 
Read your Bible -- you might be surprised by the answers it gives. (GENTLE) Margaret, you can't go down a path unless you know, in your heart, it's the right one. 
MARGARET And how do you know...? 
ASIAN LADY #2 (SHE SMILES) Because our beliefs are supported by the Scriptures. 
Jehovah is the God of truth. 
Beat. 
Margaret glances over at a half-completed "Keane" on the easel. 
A strange pause. 
MARGARET What does that mean, exactly? 
ASIAN LADY #2 (EMPHATIC) Honesty leads to self-respect. 
A feeling of well-being. 
Margaret is piqued. 
Her eyes widen. 
Like a Keane. 
CUT TO: INT. HAWAIIAN HOUSE - NIGHT Margaret is enthralled, avidly perusing a happy-looking booklet, "The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life." MARGARET It says here a worshiper of Jehovah must be honest in all things. 
Jane snorts. 
JANE I just can't believe you let people in the house. 94. 
MARGARET I have nothing to hide! (TORRID) It also says no lies. "Speak truth. 
Let the stealer steal no more." Margaret and Jane lock eyes. 
CUT TO: INT. WOODSIDE HOUSE - DAY Loud JAZZ plays. 
Back home, Walter is living a Man's, Man's World. 
He's partying, drinking and dancing with two cute HIPPIE CHICKS in bikinis. 
The place is like a WAREHOUSE, Keane PRINTS stacked everywhere. 
HIPPIE CHICK Shit, this is crazy! All these copies... you're like Warhol! WALTER Nah, Warhol's like me. 
That fruitfly stole my act! "The Factory"? 
I had a factory before he had a soup can! The girls scrunch their faces, lost. 
Then -- DING-DONG! Walter peeks out the window, then grins. 
WALTER Ah! It's my art supplies. 
INT. PAINTING ROOM - SECONDS LATER Alone, Walter eagerly pries open a GIANT CRATE. He pulls out padding. 
Wadded Honolulu newspapers. 
Then... a PAINTING. Ah! A new WAIF, surrounded by colorful tropical plants. 
Walter smiles triumphantly -- until -- his happiness melts into confusion. 
Then horror. 
We ZOOM INTO the painting's SIGNATURE. It says "MDH Keane." Walter freaks. 
WALTER AAAGGGGHH! CUT TO: INT. HAWAIIAN KINGDOM HALL - DAY The JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES sing a joyous, high-spirited PSALM: 95. 
JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES "Tremble not before your foe, Let all lovers of truth know! That my reigning Son, Christ Jesus, From the heav'ns has cast the foe. 
Soon will bind the Devil, Satan, Letting all his victims go!" Margaret and Jane are singing happily. 
INT. HAWAIIAN HOUSE - DAY Margaret pours her liquor down the sink. 
Margaret tosses her cigarettes in the trash. 
Margaret swells, feeling a burst of power. 
Then a VOICE: D.J. (O.S.) Oh yeah! We got a special guest today. 
A world-famous celebrity who just called up and asked to come in..! INT. RADIO BOOTH - DAY Angle on BIG LOLO, a gregarious Hawaiian D.J. in headphones. 
D.J. 
She's malihini! Moved to the islands a couple months ago... so let's give a big aloha to Margaret Keane! He pops in a cart. 
Canned APPLAUSE plays. 
We reveal across from him... 
Margaret. 
He grins. 
D.J. 
So is it true your husband Walter is the top-selling painter in the world? 
We SLOWLY PUSH IN to her. 
Tentative, she speaks. 
MARGARET No... 
Big Lolo. 
Everything you just said is false. 
Margaret takes a deep breath. 
Working up her courage. 
MARGARET One: Walter is no longer my husband. (a long pause) And Two: He's not... a painter. 
Margaret exhales. 
The D.J. is confused. 
He checks his notes. 96. 
D.J. 
But, am I... mixed-up? 
Ain't he the guy who does the crazy eyes? 
MARGARET No. Though he's been taking credit for ten years. (STRONG) I'm the only painter in the family. 
Margaret slowly smiles. 
And then... a calmness comes over her. 
Like a cloud has lifted. 
INT. RADIO STATION HALLWAY - DAY Margaret and Jane walk away. 
Jane beams proudly, then gives her mother a warm hug. 
Then -- LOUD CLICKING: CUT TO: INT. NEW YORK TIMES - DAY John Canaday stands over a WIRE SERVICE TELETYPE MACHINE. He stares at a printout, incredulous. 
CANADAY You have got to be kidding! INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - DAY TIGHT - The San Francisco Examiner. 
A small headline says "EYE DID IT! CLAIMS WIFE" We PULL OUT, revealing Dee-Ann. 
She grins in disbelief. 
DEE-ANN I knew it!!! INT. SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER - DICK'S CUBICLE - DAY Dick Nolan reads the article -- and SPITS UP his martini. 
INT. HUNGRY I - DAY Banducci CACKLES, terribly amused. 
INT. ART GALLERY - DAY Ruben SHRIEKS at the article. 
RUBEN Who would WANT credit?! 97. 
INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY Walter sits in his favorite haunt, eating lunch and reading a NEWSPAPER. Suddenly -- he GASPS. WALTER Holy mother of GOD! Walter JERKS UP -- feral -- like an animal sensing danger. 
He whirls and looks around. 
Paranoia ratcheting. 
Is everybody staring at him? 
Walter starts shaking in horror. 
Then -- he jumps and BOLTS OUT. INT. BAR - NIGHT Walter sits with Dick. 
Walter's desperate, sweaty. 
WALTER Margaret's gone berserk! You gotta help me! I need a story, a wire story -- national! -- to calm things down. 
Dick peers shrewdly. 
DICK I don't know... 
Walter. 
What she has said is pretty inflammatory. 
WALTER But it's nuts! It doesn't even make sense. 
When I was studying art at the Beaux Arts in Paris, she was still a kid in Tennessee! Dick reacts. 
Walter whips out the "Tomorrow's Master's" BOOK. WALTER Look! These are my early sketches. (he flips pages, like a MAGICIAN) See?! Berlin orphans, 1946! DICK (PIQUED) But... how could she... 
WALTER Exactly! It's impossible! We didn't meet for another nine years! After she busted her first marriage. (HE SHRUGS) Hell, she busted OUR marriage! Sleeping around with whatever trash she could find!! Dick's head is spinning. 98. 
DICK I-I, but... why would Maggie do this? 
WALTER She's unhinged! She left me and moved into the jungle. 
She fell in with a bunch of religious zealots: (WHISPERING) Jehovah's Witnesses. 
DICK I really don't know much about them... 
WALTER Oh! These people are gone! Solid gone! They don't celebrate Christmas, they can't salute the flag... they won't even let Janie go to the prom! Dick is startled. 
INT. HAWAIIAN HOUSE - DAY Margaret sits with a GROUP of her Witness friends. 
She is sorrowful. 
Confused. 
Clutching ASSORTED NEWSPAPERS. MARGARET He made me sound crazy!! ASIAN LADY #2 Just rise above it. 
MARGARET But how can I?! He claims I copied HIM! That he taught ME how to paint! (reading the NEWSPAPER) "She used a slide projector to trace my work and fill in the colors." ASIAN LADY #1 And which part of that is untrue? 
MARGARET ALL OF IT! (IMPASSIONED) When I finally told the truth, I felt good about myself for the first time in years!! I'm not going to let him take that away. 
Nobody is sure what to say. 
Until -- Jane pipes up: JANE Hey. 
Is Jehovah okay with suing?? 
CUT TO: 99. 
EXT. HONOLULU FEDERAL COURTHOUSE - DAY The mighty courtroom steps are SWARMING WITH PEOPLE. It's a circus. 
LOCAL TV NEWS CREWS do standups: REPORTER #1 Seventeen million dollars! (BEAT) The art world is abuzz! Is it possible that the decade's top-selling painter can't even paint??! REPORTER #2 Or is Mrs. 
Keane simply a bitter ex- wife, trying to steal her husband's fame and fortune? (BEAT) Today in Federal Court, lawyers present their opening arguments in the case of Margaret Keane vs. 
Walter Keane and Gannett Newspapers. 
A trial that could produce the largest libel and slander award in Hawaiian history. 
Margaret, Jane, Margaret's LAWYER, and her FRIENDS walk up. 
Margaret glances over -- and spots FEMINIST SUPPORTERS smiling at her. 
They hold up signs: "Stand Up and Be Counted!" Margaret is bewildered. 
She hurries in. 
AT THE CURB Walter and a POSSE OF LAWYERS exit a towncar. 
The REPORTERS charge over, as Walter puts on a confident face. 
REPORTER #1 Mr. Keane! Are you at all concerned about the charges? 
WALTER I'm angry as hell! But I'm lucky to have the mighty Gannett News Company watching my back. 
I expect to have this whole trial dismissed by noon. (BEAT) Truthfully, my only concern is that somebody get this woman some psychiatric care. 
She needs it! CUT TO: INT. FEDERAL COURTROOM - LATER The EIGHT JURORS watch attentively. 
Walter sits with the table of slick Gannett lawyers. 
The lead lawyer stands in front of the irritable Chinese JUDGE. 100. 
GANNETT LAWYER Margaret Keane is a public figure. 
And as such, she has to prove that our newspapers published statements, aware of probable falsity. (BEAT) But there is no evidence that our editors could have known that the assertions were untrue. (BEAT) We would like to submit 692 articles and interviews in which Mrs. 
Keane credits Mr. Keane as the painter of the so-called "big eye" children. 
His Associate hands two massive bound PILES OF NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES to the BAILIFF. Margaret winces. 
Walter grins, eating it up. 
The Judge stares sourly at the piles. 
JUDGE How many years back do these go? 
GANNETT LAWYER Mrs. 
Keane has been making these statements since 1958. 
Beat. 
JUDGE This is a very strange case. 
These paintings hang in museums all over the world, attributed to Mr. Keane. 
And regardless of the truth, Mrs. 
Keane has contributed immeasurably to the confusion... 
The Judge stares off... then makes a decision. 
JUDGE It seems impossible that Gannett's actions would ever meet the legal standard for libel. 
So -- the charge against them is dismissed. 
WIDE The Lawyer smiles, relieved. 
GANNETT LAWYER Thank you, Your Honor! 101. 
Walter peers, comprehending... and then, a realization slowly kicks in. 
His face turns to horror. 
The Lawyer nods humbly, then spins away. 
He smirks at Walter. 
GANNETT LAWYER Good luck, Keane. 
AT THE DEFENSE TABLE The ENTIRE LEGAL TEAM jumps up and begins packing their briefcases. 
Walter sputters in astonishment. 
WALTER "Good luck"? 
W-where the hell are you going?! GANNETT LAWYER We were charged with libel. 
You're charged with slander. (BLASE) Just dance your way out of it. 
The Lawyers file out, leaving Walter alone at the table. 
He looks very small and pale. 
The Judge peers quizzically. 
JUDGE Mr. Keane, you appear to be without counsel. 
Would you like a postponement, in order to get your affairs in order? 
Walter glances over at Margaret. 
She stifles a laugh. 
He glares daggers. 
Then, cocksure, foolhardy, he jumps to his feet. 
WALTER I've always taken care of myself, Your Honor. 
And I don't need a bunch of rent-a-suits to defend my good name! (BEAT) Let's PROCEED! CUT TO: INSERT - WIRE SERVICE TELETYPE MACHINE Words type out: "AP - HONOLULU - KEANE TRIAL TAKES STARTLING TURN" 102. 
INSERT - ANOTHER WIRE SERVICE MACHINE More words type out: "UPI - HONOLULU - HE'S A PAINTER... 
AND A LAWYER?" INT. DICK NOLAN'S OFFICE - DAY Dick frantically types at his typewriter. 
DICK (V.O.) I'm concerned about my old pal Walter Keane. 
The Hawaiian heat may have cooked his brain! The only thing he knows about courtrooms and lawyers comes from watching Perry Mason on television! CUT TO: INT. COURTROOM - LATER Walter stands down front. 
Like a Broadway star, center-stage. 
WALTER I'm the sole creator of my art. 
This is my total life. 
My contribution to the world -- JUDGE Mr. KEANE! I've told you, you must ask the witness questions! If you're acting as your own attorney, you cannot make statements at this time. 
WALTER Oh. Right! Ah, sorry, Your Honor. (BEAT) It's hard to keep this all straight... 
Walter gathers his thoughts -- then turns to the WITNESS STAND. Sitting in it... is Margaret. 
WALTER Mrs. 
Keane. 
It seems impossible that you'd expect anybody to swallow your fantastic story -- JUDGE MR. KEANE!! Walter grimaces. 
He tries again, choosing his words. 
WALTER Mrs. 
Keane. 
You seem like a lucid woman. 
Reasonably intelligent... 
So how could you possibly have gone along with such a far-out scheme? 103. 
We slowly MOVE IN ON MARGARET. This is her moment. 
And then -- quietly, she speaks. 
MARGARET I was forced into it. 
You had -- She stops, bothered by this awkwardness. 
She looks away from Walter, to the Jury instead. 
MARGARET He had me dominated. 
He would rant and rave if I didn't do what he wanted. 
I was afraid. 
I didn't see any option, so I went along. 
I felt very bad... 
WALTER (like a TV lawyer) I want to remind you you are under oath. 
The Judge SLAMS his fists down, enraged. 
Walter jumps. 
WALTER S-sorry. 
Margaret turns back to the Jury. 
MARGARET I just gave in. 
I allowed him to take credit for the big eyes. 
They reflected all my feelings... and... it was like losing a child... (SHE SIGHS) I was weak. 
I didn't feel I could leave and support myself and my daughter. 
He said nobody would buy the paintings without his personality. (SOFT) Maybe he was right... (TO WALTER) You were very talented at being charming. 
You were a genius at salesmanship and promotion. 
WALTER Hm! It sounds like you've described two different men. 
One a sadistic ogre... and the other a delightful bon vivant. 
Margaret stares him in the eyes. 
MARGARET That's you, Walter. 
Jekyll and Hyde. 104. 
WALTER What an outrageous statement! I demand we strike that from the record! JUDGE (he SLAMS his fist) Overruled!! MARGARET (she loses her temper) No! You're outrageous! Constantly criticizing! Wearing me down! Saying I'd be "knocked off" if I ever told the truth!! The Jury GASPS. Walter throws out his hands. 
WALTER Your HONOR! I ask for a mistrial! Both Keanes starts QUARRELING. The Judge STANDS. JUDGE HEY! This is not a domestic squabble! Or -- maybe it is. 
But the rest of us have no interest in watching you two go at it. 
Walter calms himself, contrite. 
WALTER I'm sorry for the emotions. 
I'm an artist. 
The Judge stares harshly. 
JUDGE Maybe. 
IN THE BACK OF THE COURTROOM Two SKETCH ARTISTS are busy, drawing the trial. 
One guy pokes the other one, to show off his work. 
His SKETCH is a typical courtroom drawing, except everyone is drawn with big ridiculous Keane eyes. 
The second guy GIGGLES. His buddy grins, then quickly erases the silly eyes before anyone sees it. 
CUT TO: INT. COURTROOM - LATER Margaret is back at the litigant's table, with her lawyer. 105. 
Walter stands, at his table. 
He shouts out. 
WALTER I call as my witness... 
Mr. Walter Stanley Keane! A strange beat. 
The Jurors glance at each other. 
Walter reacts, like he just heard his name. 
He strides jauntily over to the witness stand. 
The BAILIFF gives the Judge a weird look. 
Then, he pulls out a Bible. 
Walter slaps down his hand. 
BAILIFF Do you swear to the tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? 
WALTER YESSS! Walter bounces out, a bit manic. 
He runs back to his lawyer table, then spins to address the empty witness stand. 
WALTER Mr. Keane. 
There has been a lot of innuendo and contradictory testimony about the genesis of the "big-eyed waifs." Would you mind clarifying to this court, once and for all, who spawned these paintings? 
Walter sprints back into the witness stand. 
He sits, then reacts coyly, as if he's surprised. 
WALTER Why -- I created the children. 
Walter starts to stand again -- but the Judge SLAMS his bench. 
JUDGE The choreography is not necessary. 
Just sit down and testify. 
Oh. Walter sits, then gathers his thoughts... 
We slowly PUSH IN. He smiles, wistfully... 
WALTER I've had a wonderful life. 
I've been an artist, a world traveler, a friend of untold celebrities... (he gets misty-eyed) But when I look back at it all, when I peer into my heart and define what mattered... (MORE) 106. 
WALTER (CONT'D) it is that I was dedicated to the hungry children of the world. (GENUINE) It all began in Berlin. 
After World War II... 
DISSOLVE TO: LATER WALTER ...the orphans were clutching the barbed wire. 
Their bodies lacerated, their fingers scrawny, their eyes big and helpless. 
Imploring me, begging me... "Do something!" (HUSHED) "Do something." DISSOLVE TO: LATER WALTER ...and then Miss Joan Crawford walked up to me... 
LATER WALTER ...Kim Novak... 
LATER WALTER ...Liberace... 
LATER WALTER ...Wayne Newton... 
LATER WALTER Miss Natalie Wood walked up and said, "That is the greatest single painting I have ever seen in my entire life." The Judge is bored out of his mind. 
LATER WALTER I was born in a small town. 
My father made upholstery for the automobile INDUSTRY -- 107. 
JUDGE You're done. 
Walter stops, surprised. 
WALTER B-but, I'm not finished -- JUDGE Actually, you are! (he blows his stack) I cannot stomach one more wild tangent or shaggy dog tale. 
You're not testifying -- you're filibustering! The Federal Courts are overburdened enough, without your docket-clogging nonsense. (BEAT) We can stay here until we grow old and die... but it's obvious that this case boils down to your word versus Mrs. 
Keane's word. 
WALTER (HOPEFUL) So... mistrial? 
JUDGE NO! It's not a mistrial!! In my opinion, there's only one way to clear up this thicket. 
You are both going to paint. 
Walter gasps, stunned. 
All color drains from his face. 
ANGLE - MARGARET Her face lights up. 
She slowly breaks into a satisfied smile. 
CUT TO: INT. COURTROOM - LATER The doors SLAM open. 
The Bailiff leads in a crew of COURT DEPUTIES, all carrying ART SUPPLIES: Easels, brushes, paint... 
BAILIFF Awright, bring those easels down. 
Careful, don't bump anything... watch it with those paint cans, I got some newspaper on the floor down front... 
The Jury is fascinated. 
Margaret watches, quite eager. 
In the gallery, Jane grins. 
But Walter is horrified. 
Trying not to tremble. 108. 
DOWN FRONT The Bailiff directs the deputies, setting up TWO EASELS, back to back. 
On each easel is placed a small square canvas. 
The Judge addresses the room. 
JUDGE Now, I'm not looking for a masterpiece. 
I don't know much about these things -- I'm a jurist, not an art critic -- but, is one hour enough? 
Margaret nods: Sure. 
Shaking, Walter barely moves his head. 
JUDGE Okay then. 
You've both been provided with identical supplies... so -- without any further business... 
Mrs. 
Keane, Mr. Keane, the court is yours. 
WIDE Margaret glances at Walter. 
What will he do? 
Walter's face is grimly blank. 
Margaret proceeds. 
Slowly, she pushes her chair from the table and rises. 
Walter doesn't move. 
Margaret walks over to the closest EASEL, then sits. 
She ties on a smock over her checkered dress. 
THE JURORS crane their necks, intently curious. 
MARGARET takes a pencil. 
She peeks over at Walter -- who's still glued to his seat. 
His face tight, his expression queasy. 
Staring off to some faraway place. 
Margaret looks up at the CLOCK. 3:20. 
Okay then. 
Totally calm, in a motion she's done so many times, she focuses on the canvas and starts outlining a Waif. 
Everybody watches. 
Effortlessly, she pencils the EYES. They are enormous. 
The largest orbs she has ever done. 109. 
WALTER looks ill. 
Wracked with uncertainty. 
The Judge turns to him. 
JUDGE Mr. Keane? 
WALTER (FAINT) I'm... setting the mood. (WHISPERING) Getting the... muse to strike... 
JUDGE (BEAT) Well, your muse has 58 minutes. 
MARGARET fills in more detail. 
Ears... nose... then, little fingers clutching a fence. 
The child is peeking over it, staring right at us... 
WALTER is melting down. 
In total crisis... 
THE CLOCK'S second hand sweeps around. 
It's 3:34... 
THE JURORS look from Margaret to Walter. 
Why isn't he moving?? 
MARGARET finishes penciling. 
She leans back, satisfied with the composition. 
Then, she reaches for... the PAINT. She unscrews a tube and squirts it on the palette. 
She rests it on her lap and starts mixing a flesh tone... 
THE JUDGE gapes at Walter, befuddled. 
WALTER feels all eyes on him. 
He has to do something. 
Hesitantly, visibly shaking, he rises from the table. 
Margaret notices this. 110. 
Walter braces himself, trying to look confident, then takes a step. 
Suddenly -- he SQUEALS. WALTER OW! Walter contorts his face in AGONY. He grabs his shoulder. 
JUDGE Mr. Keane! Are you all right? 
WALTER No -- it's -- (GRIMACING) Ah shoot! My old shoulder injury just flared up. 
I've got a bad muscle -- I've been taking medication for the inflammation... 
Walter shrugs pathetically -- WALTER I -- I don't think I'll be able to paint today. 
THE JUDGE is astonished. 
WIDE The courtroom reacts. 
MARGARET peers at Walter, knowingly. 
She's not surprised. 
This was his only way out. 
A look between them -- and then she cocks a half-smile and turns back to the canvas. 
She squirts out some white oil paint, then begins painting the eyes. 
WALTER sinks down in his chair, beaten. 
All life gone. 
He stares at the emerging canvas, eyes wide, and we PUSH INTO WALTER'S FACE. He is witnessing the end of his empire... the destruction of everything that makes him who he is. 
We push in TIGHTER... 
TIGHTER... until the screen fills with his two eyes. 111. 
Big. 
Sad. 
And filling with tears. 
CUT TO: EXT. FEDERAL COURTHOUSE - DAY The doors open, and Margaret comes tumbling out, victorious. 
She has WON! She's surrounded by Jane, her friends, and a MOB OF REPORTERS. They all SHOUT: "Mrs. 
Keane! Margaret! Congratulations!!" MARGARET Thank you! Thank you so much. 
REPORTER #2 What are you going to call the painting? 
She smiles, clutching the finished Waif. 
MARGARET "Exhibit 224." They all ROAR with laughter. 
A Reporter does a stand-up: REPORTER #1 The jury found in favor of Margaret Keane on all points. 
She won on charges of defamation, emotional distress, damaged reputation -- IN THE BACKGROUND Walter drifts out, disheveled and lost. 
He stares hazily... angrily at the crowd. 
WALTER What a group of idiots... a quagmire of incompetence... (RAMBLING) This doesn't change a thing! We slowly PULL AWAY, leaving him tiny in the shot. 
Forgotten. 
BACK AT MARGARET She hugs Jane. 
The Reporter jumps in. 
REPORTER #2 Margaret! Do you feel vindicated by the high award? 
MARGARET Oh... it was never about the money. 
And honestly -- I doubt Walter will even pay. 112. 
The Reporter chuckles. 
Margaret turns serious. 
MARGARET I just wanted credit for what I had done. 
The justice is... 
I got my art back. (SOFT) My prayers have been answered. 
Margaret takes Jane's hand and starts to walk away. 
Among the eager fans, a PORTLY LADY steps out, holding a BOOK. She smiles nervously. 
PORTLY LADY Margaret! Could I possibly have your autograph? 
Margaret looks down -- and realizes the book is Walter's volume of "TOMORROW'S MASTERS" Margaret stares at it in wonder, then quickly signs the cover. 
CLOSEUP - MARGARET We hold. 
She slowly smiles in pride. 
DISSOLVE TO: INT. MARGARET KEANE GALLERY - DAY A brand-new gallery of Margaret's art. 
The walls are covered with NEWLY-PAINTED Waifs and MDH's. 
We GLIDE through the gallery... down the corridors of children and women... 
These paintings of big-eyed children are different. 
They're in magnificent colorful gardens, surrounded by joyful splashes of red, orange, green... 
CLOSING CARDS: "Walter never accepted defeat, insisting he was the true artist for the rest of his life. 
He died in 2000, bitter and penniless. 
He never produced another painting." "Margaret found personal happiness and remarried. 
After many years in Hawaii, she moved back to San Francisco and opened a new gallery. 
She still paints everyday." We move CLOSER to one child, into the face, until the eyes fill the frame. 
And then... finally, we tilt down. 
Revealing that the child is smiling. 
FADE OUT. 
THE END
INTERSTELLAR Written by Jonathan Nolan STORY BY Jonathan Nolan, Kip Thorne & Lynda Obst MARCH 12 2008 SPACE. But not the dark lonely corner of it we're used to. 
This is a glittering inferno -- the center of a distant galaxy. 
Suddenly, something TEARS past at incredible speed: a NEUTRON STAR. It SMASHES headlong through everything it encounters... planets, stars. 
Can anything stop this juggernaut? 
Yes. 
Something looms at the heart of the galaxy, hidden inside the blinding starlight, a dark flaw in the fabric of existence itself: a BLACK HOLE. The neutron star is pulled into the black hole's swirl, spiraling closer and closer to destruction. 
Finally, it contacts the hole's edge and EXPLODES. The EXPLOSION is so powerful that it sends shock waves into the fabric of space-time itself. 
We ride one of these waves, racing back out from the black hole. 
Suddenly, a portion of the wave disappears down a crystal- like hole, emerging in a much darker region of the universe -- a backwater that, as the wave races past a giant red planet with a distinctive eye, we recognize as our own. 
The wave, now just an infinitesimal ripple, finally reaches our blue planet. 
It drops into our atmosphere over North America, toward the high desert east of the Cascades, and through the roof of a nondescript warehouse. 
The wave tickles the atoms in the steel shell of a vacuum chamber, then dances a tiny jig with a laser beam reflected in a heavy piece of glass. 
The wave shoots back out of the building and disappears in the fractal branches of a tumbleweed resting against a concrete tube that stretches for miles in the desert. 
An SUV speeds past the tumbleweed and we follow it till it parks at another plain-looking building at the opposite end of the tube. 
A MAN climbs out of the SUV. INT. CONTROL ROOM, WAREHOUSE -- DAY The man lets himself into a large room that looks like Mission Control. 
He pours himself a cup of coffee. 
It is the weekend and the place is empty. 
No one has been there to see the displays flashing a distinctive shape -- a pulse followed by a series of echoes. 
The man looks up at the screen, then DROPS his cup of coffee. 
CUT TO: 2. 
INT. LIGO OFFICES, CALTECH, PASADENA -- DAY The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory headquarters at Caltech is a frenzy of activity. 
POSTDOCS and RESEARCHERS huddle around monitors and printouts, arguing. 
ANSEN, 60s, the director of LIGO, walks through the frenzy. 
A postdoc hands him a printout: a pulse followed by echoes. 
INT. LIGO DIRECTOR'S OFFICE, CALTECH -- DAY Ansen steps into the relative calm of a large, sunlit office, which overlooks a grassy stretch of Caltech's campus. 
His ASSISTANT, 30s, is on the phone, on hold. 
He looks up at Ansen as he enters. 
ASSISTANT I'm on hold with the INS. (COVERS MICROPHONE) Don't you think we should double check the triangulation before we CALL ANYBODY- ANSEN We have double checked it. 
Someone finally picks up the line. 
ASSISTANT Yes. 
I'm trying to reach- (pause, listens) No, I don't think you understand how serious this is. (PAUSE) Because if you did, we'd be having this conversation in person. 
He listens for a moment, then hangs up the phone, confused. 
ANSEN What did they say? 
ASSISTANT They said we should look out the window. 
Ansen steps to the window and looks out: In the courtyard below, coeds are scrambling to get out of the way as a military helicopter sets down in the middle of the quad and dozens of ARMED FEDERAL AGENTS converge on his building. 3. 
INT. MAIN CONFERENCE ROOM, LIGO, CALTECH -- DAY Ansen sits, alone, on one side of a conference table. 
The other side is filled with GOVERNMENT MEN -- NSA mostly, some DIA. The door opens and his assistant steps in. 
Armed guards pat him down, then shove him into a seat. 
ANSEN Is that really necessary? 
One of the NSA agents leans forward. 
NSA AGENT You've been complaining for years that the government doesn't take your project seriously enough, Doctor. (SMILES) You can't have it both ways. 
Ansen motions to his assistant, who turns on a projector. 
On-screen, we see the familiar pulse and echoes. 
ANSEN Yesterday morning, our facility in Hanford identified this signal: a neutron star colliding with a supermassive black hole. 
We went through the last year's data and triangulated the source. 
The pulse is translated into a crude animatic of a neutron star circling into the black hole. 
NSA AGENT We know that, Doctor. 
What we don't know is why, according to your numbers, this event took place right here in our own solar system. 
Suddenly, the image overlays the sun, the earth, and the rest of our solar system around the black hole. 
ANSEN It didn't. 
Because if it had we'd all be dead by now. 
On-screen, Jupiter, then the Earth and the inner planets are consumed by the black hole. 
Only the sun survives, pulled into orbit around its new master. 
ANSEN (CONT'D) Which leaves only one explanation: The signal traveled through a (MORE) 4. 
ANSEN (CONT'D) wormhole. 
A gateway to a distant corner of the universe. 
The black hole is on the far side. 
On-screen, the black hole system is removed to a distant corner, connected to ours by a tunnel through space-time. 
A gravity wave from the collision travels through the tunnel. 
NSA AGENT I've read your book, Doctor. 
You said that wormholes are impossible. 
ANSEN There is nothing quite as satisfying as being proved utterly wrong. (SMILES) I said that a wormhole couldn't exist naturally. 
Not for more than a few billionths of a second. 
It would have to be... stabilized. 
NSA AGENT Stabilized by what? 
Ansen pauses, unsure. 
His assistant steps in to his defense. 
ASSISTANT We don't have any way to answer that question. 
NSA AGENT (IGNORES HIM) You're not under peer review here, Doctor. 
I don't care about your reputation. 
I need to know how that thing got there. 
Now. 
Ansen finally speaks up. 
ANSEN If you're worried about an invasion, I would start drafting the articles of surrender. (SMILES) Whoever they are, if they can build a wormhole, they could erase us in the blink of an eye. 
Luckily, that also means we have nothing they could be interested in. 
NSA AGENT Then why is it there? 5. 
ANSEN I don't know. 
Maybe it's an invitation. 
A chance to commune with an advanced species. 
The assistant, embarrassed, looks down. 
The agent notices. 
NSA AGENT You don't agree? 
ASSISTANT (DELICATE) No. I don't think we can assume an alien intelligence built the wormhole. (CHANGES TACK) But the opportunity it represents is incredible. 
We could explore parts of the universe we never dreamt of reaching in our lifetimes. 
The agent exchanges a look with one of his colleagues, who steps out of the room. 
ANSEN We need to get back to work. 
I have a conference call with our European partners in fifteen minutes. 
NSA AGENT We severed the connections to your European partners this morning. 
ANSEN (INDIGNANT) You can't do that. 
The Europeans put up some of the funding... 
GOVERNMENT MAN We'll send them a check. (STANDS) Your project is now classified under the State Secrets Act. 
He steps out the door, leaving the men alone. 
The assistant, outraged, turns back to his boss. 
ASSISTANT They can't keep this a secret. 
You know that. 
Sooner or later... 
The younger man looks down, embarrassed, as he notices that tears are rolling down the older man's cheeks. 6. 
ANSEN I don't care about that. 
I've spent my whole life being afraid we would wipe ourselves out before this moment arrived. 
We've made so many mistakes, I wasn't sure we'd make it... 
The assitant realizes that the old man is weeping for joy. 
Relief. 
ANSEN (CONT'D) But this will change everything. 
Fifty years from now, nothing will be the same. 
The older man looks at the simulation on the screen of the tiny link between our galaxy and another. 
FADE TO BLACK EXT. CORNFIELD, CENTRAL CALIFORNIA -- DAY Corn. 
As far as the eye can see. 
SUPER TITLE: "FIFTY YEARS LATER" A large old diesel tour bus is parked by the side of a dirt road, smoke pouring out of its open hood. 
A dozen MEN in BASEBALL UNIFORMS are standing around the front of the bus. 
A battered PICKUP pulls up, and a MAN, 30s, gets out, leaving his two SONS in the car. 
This is COOPER. He joins the ballplayers staring at the lifeless diesel engine. 
BALLPLAYER Seized up on us. 
COOPER Long way to come by bus. 
I thought you guys would have a plane. 
BALLPLAYER We did. 
Ran out of parts for it. 
You know anything about diesels? 
COOPER A little. 
Cooper steps to the engine compartment. 
The ballplayer notices Cooper's two boys, TOM, 15, and MURPH, 10, watching them. 
He wanders over. 7. 
BALLPLAYER You think your dad's going to be able to help us out? 
Murph, a filth-encrusted kid with a black eye, smiles at the ballplayer. 
MURPH My dad can fix anything. (WRY SMILE) Except maybe your fastball. 
The ballplayer frowns: smartass kid. 
After a moment under the hood, Cooper signals to the driver, who tries the engine. 
It turns over once, then STARTS. BALLPLAYER Sure appreciate the help. 
COOPER (SHRUGS) You don't make it, my boys won't get to see you lose. 
The ballplayers load up into the bus and as it pulls away, we can see the logo painted across the back of the bus for the first time: WORLD FAMOUS NEW YORK YANKEES EXT. SPACE, NEAR EARTH ORBIT Earth spins, lazily. 
From this height, it looks much the same as it has done for thousands of years. 
Suddenly, a tiny black object appears, racing toward Earth. 
The object SMASHES into a large satellite and races onward. 
Behind it, the satellite spins out of orbit in a cloud of fragments. 
EXT. BASEBALL STADIUM -- NIGHT An old minor league stadium. 
The stands are barely halfway full. 
Cooper, his boys, and Cooper's father-in-law, DONALD, 60s, have a row to themselves behind the dugout. 
Murph offers his grandpa some popcorn. 
DONALD Popcorn at a ball game is unnatural. 
I want a hot dog. 8. 
MURPH (CONFUSED) What's a hot dog? 
Suddenly, play stops on the field below as the players and fans look up at the night sky: A bright blue streak is tearing across it. 
It's beautiful. 
TOM Is that a comet, Dad? 
COOPER (shakes his head) Satellite. 
Big one. 
Probably Chinese. 
Everyone watches the fireworks as the satellite burns up in the upper atmosphere. 
After a moment, play resumes -- it's a pretty show, but everyone has seen it plenty of times before. 
Down on the field, the Dodgers' catcher misses an easy pop fly and the Yankees load the bases. 
Donald looks disgusted. 
INT. COOPER'S TRUCK -- NIGHT Cooper guides his truck along a potholed road. 
His father- in-law is riding shotgun; the boys are sleeping in the back. 
DONALD Those clowns would get their asses handed to them by the ballplayers I grew up watching. 
COOPER You ruin it for the boys when you talk like that. 
DONALD I'm not doing my grandkids any favors by lying to them. 
They're growing up watching lousy baseball. 
COOPER They didn't have any baseball at all when I was a kid. 
That shuts the old man up for now. 
They drive on in silence. 
CUT TO: 9. 
EXT. FARMHOUSE -- MORNING The sun is gently landing on the horizon, painting the sea of corn around Cooper's modest house gold. 
Cooper walks out of his house, still eating his breakfast. 
Donald is on the porch, looking at a black clouds of smoke in the distance. 
The neighboring fields are BURNING. DONALD Nelson's burning up his crops. 
Found some of the blight on the okra. 
Cooper watches the men walking through the fields, setting fire to the crop. 
COOPER I thought okra wasn't susceptible. 
DONALD (SHRUGS) Better safe than sorry. (looks at him) You've got to take the boys to school. 
COOPER Something wrong with your truck? 
DONALD (SMILES) Parent-teacher conference day. 
Cooper bends his head in dismay. 
DONALD (CONT'D) Be nice to Murph's teacher. 
She's single, you know. 
COOPER What does that have to do with anything? 
DONALD We're supposed to be repopulating the earth. 
Gotta pull your weight. 
Besides, the boys could do with a woman in their lives. 
The boys run out of the house and pile into the truck. 
Cooper pulls away before Donald can continue. 
EXT. ROAD -- DAY Cooper weaves the car along a dirt road. 
The kids are arguing over an ancient comic book in the back seat. 10. 
Cooper turns around to break it up. 
BANG -- one of the tires blows out in a foot-deep pothole. 
EXT. ROADSIDE -- DAY Cooper examines the flattened tire. 
Looks at his older son. 
COOPER Get the spare, Tom. 
TOM That is the spare. 
COOPER All right. 
We'll use the patch kit. 
He moves to the back of the truck. 
Murph suddenly looks very glum. 
MURPH I... 
I think the patch kit might not be there... (off his look) Because I was using it for my bike. 
Cooper looks down at the dirt. 
Sighs. 
COOPER Murph's law. 
MURPH (CONFUSED) What's that? 
Tom snorts with laughter. 
Turns to his dad. 
TOM The kid doesn't even know what he was named after... 
Cooper shoots Tom a look -- enough. 
TOM (CONT'D) Murph's law means what can go wrong will go wrong. 
Murph, looking hurt, walks off. 
Cooper turns to his son. 
COOPER Find something to patch it with. 
TOM How am I supposed to do that? 11. 
COOPER Figure it out. 
I'm not always going to be here to help you. 
Cooper leaves Tom to catch up with his younger son, who is looking out over the river. 
MURPH Is that really why I'm named Murph, dad? 
COOPER Listen to me. 
Murph's law doesn't mean that. 
It means what can happen will happen. 
All kinds of things. 
Good or bad. 
And that's the way you want it to be. 
MURPH Why? 
COOPER Because if nothing ever happened to you then you wouldn't learn anything. 
Murph is staring off into the distance. 
He's heard something. 
COOPER (CONT'D) Murph? 
Then Cooper hears it, too. 
A LOW RUMBLING SOUND. Cooper looks out over the river. 
Then he turns back and tackles his son to the ground. 
Suddenly, a MASSIVE AIRPLANE SOARS overhead, so close they can almost touch it. 
It bounces the truck on its suspension, then soars off over the fields behind them. 
Cooper grabs Murph and races back to the truck. 
He pulls a laptop and an antenna made out of a Pringles can out of the back of the truck. 
He hands the laptop and antenna to Murph. 
COOPER (CONT'D) Get in. 
Tom is still standing by the side of the road, wrestling with the jack. 
TOM What about the tire? 
INT. TRUCK -- MOMENTS LATER The truck is SMASHING through the cornfields as fast as Cooper can push it on three good tires. 12. 
Murph is hurriedly firing up the laptop and connecting it to the directional antenna. 
Cooper is straining to see through the cornstalks, scanning the horizon. 
TOM OVER THERE- To the right, the dark shape of the Russian drone appears, flying low over the fields. 
Cooper jerks the wheel-- EXT. RIVER -- DAY The truck BURSTS out of the corn and SPLASHES across the river and into an old, abandoned suburban housing development in the valley below, planted over with corn. 
Half a mile in front of them, the Russian drone is still hugging the ground. 
It has impossibly long, skinny wings, like an old U-2 surveillance plane, but no cockpit. 
The tops of its wings are covered in black solar cells. 
INT. TRUCK -- DAY Murph is fiddling with the computer. 
His older brother takes the computer from him and fires up emulation software. 
COOPER It's a Chinese military drone. 
Solar cells could power an entire farm. (TO TOM) Take the wheel. 
Cooper hands Murph the Pringles can antenna. 
COOPER (CONT'D) Keep it pointed right at it, OK? Murph nods. 
Tom takes the wheel as his dad works the laptop, trying to communicate with the huge Russian drone. 
The screen fills with Cyrillic characters. 
COOPER (CONT'D) Faster, Tom. 
I'm losing it. 
Tom WEAVES the truck at speed through the old, curved streets of the development, past oversized suburban mansions planted over with corn. 
They round a corner and come face-to-face with a robot harvester. 
Tom jerks the wheel to avoid it. 
BANG -- the truck loses a wing mirror against the flank of the combine. 13. 
EXT. SUBURBAN DEVELOPMENT -- DAY Tom guides the truck from street to street, trying to chart a straight path across the fields. 
The truck BOUNCES as it SMASHES through an old picket fence. 
Ahead, the drone is soaring, banking, pulling away. 
INT. TRUCK -- DAY Cooper is still trying to hack into the drone's control circuitry as they leave the development behind and begin to climb into the foothills of the Sierras. 
EXT. RIDGELINE, HILLS -- DAY Tom guides the truck along the spine of the hills. 
The drone soars overhead, making for the white tips of the Sierras. 
INT. TRUCK -- DAY Cooper is oblivious to the picturesque surroundings as he concentrates on the laptop. 
TOM (UNSURE) Dad? 
COOPER Almost got it. 
Don't slow down. 
In front of them, Tom and his brother watch as the drone plummets from view. 
TOM DAD. Cooper looks up. 
Ahead, the trail disappears as the edge of the hills falls away -- it's a three hundred-foot drop. 
Tom locks up the brakes. 
EXT. RIDGELINE, HILLS -- DAY The truck skids to a halt inches from a precipitous drop. 
Cooper climbs out, holding the laptop. 
Murph climbs out next to him, still pointing the Pringles can. 
TOM We lost it. 
COOPER (SMILING) No we didn't. 14. 
Suddenly, the drone SOARS back over them. 
Cooper types a couple keys and then moves his fingers across the trackpad. 
The huge drone banks and turns in response. 
As the boys watch, Cooper sends the drone soaring high over them, banking and soaring along the tree-lined sides of the valley, light glinting from the black panels on its back. 
It's a beautiful sight. 
Cooper crouches next to Murph. 
COOPER (CONT'D) You want to give it a whirl? 
Murph looks at his dad, wide-eyed. 
He takes the laptop and moves his fingers gingerly across the pad. 
In response, the massive plane banks into a tight turn in the valley below. 
For a moment, Murph is in pure heaven, sending the drone dancing through the valley below. 
COOPER (CONT'D) Set her down in the valley -- there, next to the river. 
Murph leads the plane in a figure eight and then begins guiding it into a gentle landing in the valley floor below. 
EXT. ABANDONED GOLF COURSE, VALLEY FLOOR -- DAY The truck limps along the overgrown fairway of a long-defunct golf course towards the massive hulk of the Russian drone, Cooper and the boys climb down. 
The valley is silent save for the truck's engine WHEEZING and SPUTTERING as it cools. 
Cooper runs a hand over the smooth carbon flank of the drone. 
TOM How long do you think it's been up there, Dad? 
COOPER Chinese mission control went down same as us, twenty years ago. 
It's been up there ever since. 
TOM What was it doing flying so low? 
Cooper reads the information pouring into his laptop. 15. 
COOPER It was looking for something. 
Intercepted some kind of signal. (SHRUGS) It's been at eighty thousand feet. 
Sun probably cooked its brain. 
Cooper runs his hand along the flank till he finds an access patch. 
He pulls out a crowbar and pries open the hatch. 
Inside, surrounded by a nest of liquid cooling tubes, is a small black module -- the drone's auto-pilot. 
Cooper looks down at Murph, who is standing at his elbow. 
MURPH What are you going to do with it? 
COOPER Reprogram it. 
Give it something socially responsible to do like drive a combine or a tractor. 
MURPH (QUIET) Couldn't we just let it go? 
It's not hurting anyone. 
Cooper looks down at his son. 
Good kid. 
COOPER We need all the help we can get, Murph. 
This thing has to adapt, just like the rest of us. 
Cooper gently pries the control module out. 
EXT. COUNTY SCHOOL -- DAY It's a small school, so all the kids and parents waiting in front know exactly who's driving the pickup truck with half of a Russian spy plane hanging out of the bed as it pulls up. 
INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE, COUNTY SCHOOL -- DAY Cooper is ushered into the office. 
The PRINCIPAL, 40s, an efficient-looking man, shakes his hand. 
PRINCIPAL Good to see you, Mr. Cooper. 
This is Ms. Kelly, Murph's teacher. 
Cooper smiles at Ms. KELLY, 30s, attractive. 16. 
PRINCIPAL (CONT'D) So we've gotten Tom's score back. 
Congratulations. 
He's going to make an excellent farmer. 
The principal slides a carbon copy across the desk to Cooper, who looks taken aback. 
COOPER What about college? 
PRINCIPAL The University of California only accepts a few hundred students a year, Mr. Cooper. 
You have to be realistic. 
COOPER You're ruling out college for him now? 
He's only fifteen. 
PRINCIPAL I'm sorry. 
I'm afraid Tom's score simply isn't high enough. 
COOPER What are you, about a 36-inch waist? (BEAT) 30-inch inseam? 
PRINCIPAL I'm not sure I see-- COOPER You're telling me you need two numbers to measure your own ass, but just one to measure my son's future? 
Ms. Kelly stifles a laugh, then, with a look from the principal, takes on the appropriate look of offense. 
PRINCIPAL I understand you're a well-educated man, Mr. Cooper. 
A scientist? 
COOPER Engineer. 
PRINCIPAL Frankly, the world doesn't need any more engineers. 
We didn't run out of trains or television sets or satellites. (BEAT) We ran out of food. 17. 
Cooper leans back. 
He's not going to win this one. 
PRINCIPAL (CONT'D) The world needs farmers, Mr. Cooper. 
And I'm sure your son Tom is going to make a fine one. (SMILES BENIGNLY) We're a caretaker generation. 
But things are getting better. 
Maybe your grandchildren will be able to attend college. 
Cooper looks down, swallowing his anger. 
COOPER Are we done? 
PRINCIPAL One more thing. 
Ms. Kelly here says that Murph brought a book to school about the lunar landings. 
He slides an old textbook with a picture of a rocket on the cover across the desk to Cooper. 
COOPER One of my old textbooks. 
Murph liked the pictures. 
MS. KELLY This is one of the old federal textbooks. 
We've replaced them with corrected versions. 
COOPER Corrected? 
MS. KELLY The new textbooks explain that the Apollo lunar missions were faked in order to bankrupt the Soviet Union. 
COOPER You don't believe we went to the moon? 
MS. KELLY I believe it was a brilliant piece of propaganda. 
The Soviets spent years trying to build rockets and other useless machines. 
COOPER "Useless machines"? 18. 
Cooper looks to the Principal for help. 
None is forthcoming. 
MS. KELLY Yes, Mr. Cooper. 
The kind of wastefulness and excess that the 20th century represented. 
Your children would be better off learning about this planet, rather than reading fantasies about leaving it. 
Cooper is silent for a long moment. 
COOPER One of those useless machines they used to make was called an MRI. If we had any of them left the doctors might have been able to find the cyst in my wife's brain before she died, rather than afterwards. 
And then my kids could have been raised by two parents, instead of me and their pain-in-the-ass grandfather. 
Ms. Kelly's face falls, ashen. 
Cooper swallows his anger. 
Most of it, anyway. 
COOPER (CONT'D) You ever consider the best thing for the world and humanity might have been for us to part company? 
Cooper gets up to leave. 
INT. TRUCK, COUNTY SCHOOL PARKING LOT -- DAY Cooper climbs into the truck, trying to hold it together. 
He PUNCHES the wheel. 
The radio KEYS to life. 
He ignores it. 
Sits for a moment in misery. 
Finally he picks up the handset. 
CB OPERATOR (O.S.) Got a call from Riggs, down in Galveston. 
Says some of the tractors you built him went haywire last night. 
COOPER Just tell him to power down the controllers for a couple minutes. 
CB OPERATOR (O.S.) I did. 
He wants you to come down in person anyway. 
Says he found something you should take a look at. 19. 
Cooper stares at the wheel. 
Shakes his head in frustration. 
EXT. AIRSTRIP -- DAY Cooper pulls his truck up to a grimy-looking hangar. 
Pulls a tarp off of an ancient Piper Cub. 
Checks it over. 
INT. PIPER CUB -- DAY Cooper guides the plane along a long sliver of deserted beach. 
The radio crackles to life. 
COOPER Bravo-two-eight, requesting permission to enter your airspace. 
AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL (O.S.) Permission granted. 
Welcome to the sovereign nation of Texas. 
Coop hangs up the radio. 
Banks the plane inland. 
EXT. GULF COAST -- DAY Below, a combine harvester fights its way up the dunes, trying to reach the beach, its wheels struggling for traction in the soft sand. 
A MAN waves up at Cooper's plane as it circles overhead. 
Cooper lands the plane on a deserted roadway. 
Jumps down. 
He intercepts one of the combines as it trundles past, trying to reach the dunes. 
He pops open the cabin. 
Inside is a mess of wires hooked into an auto-pilot not unlike the one he ripped out of the drone. 
He checks the fault code and resets the computer. 
The man jogs over to meet him. 
RIGGS Thanks for coming down. 
Half of 'em took off last night, looking for something. (points to dunes) Looks like they found it, too. 
I thought you were the man to see it. 
Riggs starts walking up the dune. 
Cooper follows. 
Below, on the beach, a dozen more combines and other farming vehicles are lined up at the tideline, warm gulf water lapping at their metal flanks. 
They are circling a deep crater. 20. 
As they watch, an ancient autonomous SUB BEACHES itself, trying to reach the crater. 
EXT. CRATER'S EDGE, BEACH -- DAY Cooper steps between the waiting machines and peers down into the crater. 
At the very bottom is a ROUND BLACK BALL, about a foot across -- the same object we saw punch a hole in the side of a satellite. 
Every few seconds, it emits a distinctive CHIRP. Cooper checks his rad meter. 
A tiny reading -- non-lethal. 
He takes off his watch and hands it to Riggs. 
Then he slides down into the hole. 
The probe CHIRPS as Cooper slides down on top of it. 
He rubs a hand across its smooth composite bulk. 
RIGGS (FROM ABOVE) You think it's an alien? 
Cooper wipes sand off of the object, revealing the faint, familiar outline etched into the side of the probe: The stars and stripes of the old federal government. 
COOPER Not exactly. 
EXT. CRATER'S EDGE, BEACH -- DAY Using a rope and a winch, Cooper hauls the blackened probe out of the crater and onto the beach. 
Cooper hefts it up and carries it to the back of his plane. 
COOPER Space probe. 
Never seen one like it, though. 
Looks like it's been to hell and back. 
The probe CHIRPS as Cooper belts it into the back. 
RIGGS How do you think it wound up here? 
COOPER Lost, I guess. 
Guidance satellites would have been shot down by the Chinese twenty years ago. 
Cooper looks at the probe for a second, admiring its form. 21. 
INT. KITCHEN, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT Donald is pouring a bottle of corn beer into a bubbling vat of chowder. 
He turns to watch Cooper work, amused. 
The probe has been clamped to the kitchen table. 
Cooper works at the blackened case with a BLOWTORCH. Cooper gives up -- the torch hasn't made a scratch. 
The probe CHIRPS. COOPER Well I don't know what the hell it's made of, but I can't crack it open. 
DONALD Good. 
Clear it off the table so I can serve dinner. 
Tom and Murph walk in. 
Murph's got another black eye. 
DONALD (CONT'D) What happened this time? 
MURPH I got suspended. 
Paul said anyone who believed we went to the moon was an idiot. 
So I hit him. 
COOPER Good boy. 
Hand me the scanner. 
Murph hands his dad a defibrillator he's modified for the purpose. 
He attaches the shock pads to the sides of the probe and turns on the power. 
Numbers flash across the screen. 
Cooper hits a button on the controls and it PULSES. COOPER (CONT'D) Here we go. 
Standard NASA encryption. 
Memory's been damaged. 
Just noise. 
Hold on. 
I've got something. 
Cooper unplugs a monitor from his computer and plugs it into the defibrillator. 
After a moment, an image fills the screen: An ICE-COVERED PLANET nestled in the center of a system impossibly dense with stars. 
Murph stares, transfixed. 
MURPH Where is that, dad? 
COOPER I don't know. 
Cooper looks at the probe. 22. 
COOPER (CONT'D) Where the hell did you come from? 
Cooper shrugs. 
Turns off the monitor. 
COOPER (CONT'D) We'll take it down to Tyson's tomorrow and have it melted down. 
Might be some copper inside. 
MURPH But what about its mission? 
What about the information onboard? 
COOPER There's no one for it to report to. 
NASA is all gone. 
I'm sorry, son. 
It got home too late. 
Donald pulls his chowder off the boil and slides the pot unceremoniously onto the table. 
INT. DINING ROOM -- NIGHT The boys have gone to bed. 
Cooper and Donald are alone at the table. 
Donald hands Cooper another beer. 
DONALD I heard your meeting at the school didn't go so well. 
Cooper shakes his head in disgust. 
COOPER Maybe it's better for everyone to forget what they did back then. 
Reminds us how far we've fallen. 
DONALD (looks down,) When I was kid, it felt like they made something new every day. 
Some gadget or idea. (SMILES) Like every day was Christmas. (BEAT) But we made a lot of mistakes. 
Six billion people. 
Just try to imagine that. 
Every last one of them trying to have it all. 
Donald rolls the bottle of beer in his hands. 23. 
DONALD (CONT'D) The truth is this world isn't that bad. 
In a lot of ways its better. 
Tom will be all right, whether he goes to college or not. 
COOPER It doesn't bother me that he can't go. 
It bothers me that he doesn't care. 
DONALD Tom isn't the problem. 
He fits in this world just fine. 
You're the one who doesn't fit, Coop. 
You don't belong here. 
You were born forty years too late, or forty years too early -- I don't know. 
My daughter knew it, god bless her. 
And your kids know it, too. 
Donald drains his beer. 
Walks to the screen door. 
Stops, one hand on the frame. 
DONALD (CONT'D) You were good at something and you never got a chance to do anything with it. 
And I'm sorry, Coop. 
But that's not your kids' fault. 
Donald pushes out the screen door. 
Cooper looks at his beer. 
The probe CHIRPS. INT. BEDROOM, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT Cooper flops down on his bed, fully clothed, exhausted. 
He stares up at the ceiling. 
This is his life. 
INT. BEDROOM, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT The air is filled with a PIERCING NOISE. Cooper BOLTS upright. 
Stumbles out the door. 
INT. HALLWAY, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT Cooper's boys are in the hallway, exhausted. 
Cooper, holding a baseball bat, makes his way down the stairs. 
Cooper uses the bat to open the kitchen door. 
INT. KITCHEN, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT Cooper steps in, Murph watching from behind him. 24. 
The probe is clamped to the table, the chirp replaced with a DEAFENING SCREAM. Cooper, holding his ears, moves closer to the probe. 
He hits it with the paddles. 
No result. 
He SMASHES it with the bat. 
Nothing. 
He HITS it AGAIN and AGAIN. Finally, the clamps break off chunks of the table and the probe slams to the ground and ROLLS toward the front door. 
As it rolls, it STOPS SHRIEKING. Cooper and the others watch it roll toward the door. 
It stops at the wall. 
After a second, it begins SHRIEKING AGAIN. Cooper grabs it and rolls it toward the front door. 
Once again, the movement shuts it up. 
EXT. PORCH, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT Cooper and his boys roll the probe out of the front door. 
It BUMPS down the front steps and comes to rest in the dirt. 
After a moment, the unholy RACKET starts up again. 
Cooper keeps rolling it, but it doesn't seem to help. 
Murph looks up, sees the stars overhead. 
MURPH Try a different direction. 
As they roll the probe in a circle, its SHRIEK stops, then picks up again. 
Cooper zeroes in on the direction that keeps it quiet -- southwest -- and pushes it along in the dirt. 
COOPER It's a fail-safe. 
It's going to annoy us into taking it home. 
Cooper stops rolling the probe and, after a moment, it begins SHRIEKING again. 
TOM What are we going to do? 
Cooper gets a rope. 
COOPER We're going to get some sleep. 
He begins tying the rope around the probe. 
INT. BEDROOM, COOPER'S HOUSE -- DAY Cooper wakes. 
He's been sleeping with a pillow wrapped around his head. 
The SHRIEK can be heard, but it's muffled, distant. 25. 
INT. KITCHEN, COOPER'S HOUSE -- DAY Tom heads off for school with Donald. 
Murph, still suspended, looks up at Cooper, smiling. 
MURPH What are we doing today? 
COOPER You're staying here and cleaning the house. 
Murph looks crestfallen. 
He looks out towards the yard. 
Cooper follows his stare. 
COOPER (CONT'D) I told you, Murph. 
There's no one to take it back to. 
MURPH But what if there is, dad? 
What if there's something we can salvage? 
Cooper thinks it over. 
Murph scrambles to get his shoes. 
EXT. COOPER'S HOUSE -- DAY The shriek is still muffled. 
Cooper walks over to the well, putting in a pair of earplugs. 
A line is staked off, leading down into the well below. 
Cooper begins hauling the line up. 
As the probe breaks the surface of the water, the SHRIEK returns to its normal volume. 
Cooper rolls the probe out onto the ground. 
INT. PIPER CUB -- DAY The probe CHIRPS next to Murph in the backseat as Cooper spins the plane and guns the throttle and they bounce along the dusty runway and into the air. 
EXT. CALIFORNIA COAST -- DAY The tiny plane follows the mountains south. 
EXT. SKIES OVER LOS ANGELES -- DAY Cooper flies in low. 
Los Angeles looks much the same way it did in the early 20th century -- small settlements in Santa Monica and Downtown. 
Wildfires and earthquakes have shaken and burned what was left of the homes in between. 26. 
EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY, MALIBU -- DAY Cooper puts the plane down on the old highway and taxis up to a gas station. 
Ahead, the Coast Highway peters out and disappears beneath rows of wild grass -- Malibu has become ranchland, once again. 
EXT. GAS STATION, MALIBU -- DAY An OLD MAN looks up as Cooper steps out of the plane and checks it over. 
COOPER Got any diesel? 
OLD MAN Plenty. 
Shame you can't eat it. 
Cooper stretches the hose over to the plane. 
INT. PIPER CUB -- DAY Cooper rests a hand lightly on the controls as he follows the coast. 
Murph gazes out the window. 
In the backseat, the probe is HUMMING. A light marine layer beneath them parts, revealing SANTA CRUZ ISLAND, a large, uninhabited island. 
As Cooper soars over the island, the probe HUMS, insistent. 
MURPH I think it's home. 
Cooper circles the island until he finds a long, flat grassland in the center of the island. 
EXT. FIELD, SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- DAY The plane bounces and hops to a halt in waist-deep grass. 
Murph and Cooper climb down from the plane. 
Cooper slings a rifle over his shoulder. 
A few dozen yards from the plane they reach the tree line. 
Murph stops, mesmerized by a patch of weeds studded with bright red -- strawberries. 
MURPH Dad, what are these things? 
COOPER I don't know. 
Don't touch them. 27. 
Cooper spots something in the foliage ahead that looks a little off. 
He walks over. 
He pokes at the undergrowth with his rifle. 
The rifle CLANKS against something metal. 
Cooper reaches -- it's a camouflage scrim. 
He gently pulls it aside, revealing a chemical transport truck. 
Cooper steps back, alarmed. 
He brings up his rifle. 
COOPER (CONT'D) Murph? 
He looks around. 
Murph is nowhere to be seen. 
Cooper curses and heads into the forest to look for him. 
EXT. CLEARING, SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- DAY Cooper walks through a glade. 
He stops to get his bearings. 
Leans against a tree. 
Snatches his hand back -- the trunk of the tree is red hot. 
Cooper steps back -- it's not a tree at all, but a camouflaged chimney stack. 
He looks up: the tree is venting steam. 
Cooper walks a little further, until he finds several massive tanks. 
The tanks are filling with a bubbling liquid -- some kind of industrial process is taking place beneath him. 
Cooper finally catches up with Murph at the edge of a clearing. 
COOPER Careful. 
There's some kind of underground facility here. 
We might... 
Cooper notices his son is frozen, staring at something: Standing bolt upright in the middle of the clearing, wearing an old straw hat, is an eight-foot-tall military spec ROBOT. MURPH Is it still... alive? 
COOPER Can't be. 
It's a marine. 
Haven't made them for thirty years. 
I've never seen one intact before. 
Cooper steps closer to the robot, which is frozen. 
Its alloy frame heavily tarnished and weather-beaten. 
It looks like it might have been standing here for decades. 28. 
Cooper moves closer to it, looking into its blackened eyes. 
He steps back, clearly a little spooked. 
COOPER (CONT'D) I think we need to go, Murph. 
MURPH But can't we take it back? 
You could fix it up, get him to do chores. 
COOPER No. I don't know what this place is, but we're leaving. 
Murph, ignoring his father, steps forward to touch the robot. 
Suddenly, the robot SPRINGS into action, picking up the boy and hoisting him up to eye level. 
Cooper, stunned, points the rifle at the robot. 
The robot turns, dropping the boy, RIPS the rifle from Cooper's hands, BENDS it, then SLAMS him up against the side of the water tank. 
Cooper punches him, then winces in agony. 
Murph picks up the rifle and begins HITTING the robot as hard as he can. 
The robot opens his mouth and addresses Cooper calmly in the clipped tones of a US marine. 
ROBOT Tell the boy to stop hitting me. 
COOPER (IGNORING HIM) Hit him in the back of the neck. 
Murph raises the rifle butt. 
A voice stops him. 
VOICE (O.S.) I wouldn't do that. 
A woman, 30s, step out from the trees. 
This is AMELIA BRAND -- tough, bright, and a decent shot with the large rifle that she's pointing at Cooper. 
COOPER We were just looking for salvage. 
BRAND Is that what they call stealing these days? 
COOPER I didn't know it belonged to anyone. 29. 
BRAND It doesn't. (TO ROBOT) You want to let them go, Tars, or do you want some help with your work? 
The robot, evidently named Tars, looks at Cooper closely. 
Then lets him go. 
COOPER You've got me wrong, lady. 
BRAND Really? 
You're not the kind of guy who turns a combat marine with a supercomputer for a brain into a riding lawn mower? 
Cooper says nothing -- she's not that far off the mark. 
BRAND (CONT'D) Get back in your little plane, go back to your farming commune. 
And don't come back. 
Cooper backs up. 
Tars holds up his mangled rifle. 
Smiles. 
TARS Don't forget your gun. 
COOPER (points at Tars) Word of advice -- careful with that thing. 
When the war was over, they didn't know when to stop fighting. 
BRAND I'd trust him a lot more than I'd trust you. 
Keep moving. 
Cooper backs up to his plane. 
Tars follows him. 
Suddenly, in the plane, the probe emits a high-pitch SQUEAL. Tars responds instantly, striding past Cooper to the plane. 
He sees the probe. 
Tries to open the door. 
It's locked. 
COOPER Wait a second-- Tars TEARS the door off the plane. 
Reaches inside and pulls out the probe. 
The woman looks at it, stunned. 
BRAND Get it inside. (MORE) 30. 
BRAND (CONT'D) (points rifle at Cooper) You too. 
We'll figure out what to do with you later. 
Tars stops, and two panels open in the ground, revealing a huge, reinforced service elevator. 
INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR, UNDERGROUND BUNKER -- DAY Brand waves at a security camera and the lift begins to glide diagonally down a tunnel that cuts hundreds of feet below the island's surface. 
She keeps her weapon shouldered. 
COOPER Now who's stealing from who? 
BRAND This doesn't belong to you. 
COOPER You're right. 
It belongs to NASA, which shut down thirty years ago when the federal government ran out of money. 
Brand says nothing. 
The elevator slows to a stop at the bottom of the tunnel. 
Heavy BLAST DOORS grind open and Brand motions for Cooper to step forward. 
INT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER -- DAY They step into a vast underground facility. 
Standing in the center, braced by a launch tower, is a ten story tall rocket. 
Dozens of ROBOTS are working on in, maintaining it. 
Cooper, stunned, looks at Brand. 
COOPER Who are you people? 
BRAND (WRY) The government gave us plenty of practice looking for our own funding. (gestures with rifle) Keep moving. 
Tars carries the probe over to an area of the hangar filled with electronic equipment. 
A group of ENGINEERS and ROBOTS converge around Tars. 
An OLDER ENGINEER looks familiar -- 70s, white-haired, this is Ansen's assistant at Caltech who we met fifty years earlier. 31. 
BRAND (CONT'D) I found them outside with it. 
It looks like six. 
Maybe seven. 
I can't tell from the radiation damage. 
The older engineer looks at the probe, astonished. 
OLD ENGINEER Where did you find it? 
COOPER Galveston. 
BRAND'S FATHER (thinking it over) Of course. 
It must have been looking for Canaveral. 
Tars bolts the probe down into a purpose built rig. 
DOYLE, 40s, an engineer, begins hooking leads into the probe. 
COOPER Canaveral's been gone for thirty years. 
Brand ignores him. 
Doyle looks up from his monitor, frustrated. 
DOYLE It's not responding to the handshake. 
I can't open anything on primary. 
Brand looks up at Cooper. 
BRAND What did you do to it? 
COOPER Nothing. 
I got something off of it. 
Cooper looks around. 
There's a safety station on the wall with a battery powered defibrillator. 
COOPER (CONT'D) (TO BRAND) May I? 
Brand nods, wary. 
Cooper walks over to the wall, takes the defibrillator, and hooks it up to the probe. 
He taps into the current and runs a lead into the terminal. 
Brand's Father watches, fascinated, as Cooper fires the defibrillator. 32. 
OLD ENGINEER Of course. 
The high voltage allows you to image the entire memory unit at once. 
Information begins appearing on the terminal's screen. 
COOPER Most of the disk was noise. 
Couple of clean sectors, though. 
Suddenly, the monitor starts pulling good data off of the probe. 
The older man and Doyle begin sorting through it. 
Cooper smiles at Brand, who seems less than impressed. 
The footage of the ice-covered planet Cooper saw earlier pops onto the screen. 
The engineers and physicists get very quiet, studying the images. 
DOYLE It found something. (READING) Very thin nitrogen-based atmosphere. 
Trace radiation. 
Surface is ninety percent frozen water. 
Ten percent rock -- sedimentary composition similar to limestone. (READING) Wow. 
Pockets of oxygen below the surface. 
Lots and lots of oxygen. (EXCITED) This could be the one, boss. 
The older engineer studies the image of the ice-covered planet, thinking. 
COOPER There aren't any planets like that anywhere near earth. 
Not even if this thing was gone for thirty years. 
Brand looks at Cooper, appraising. 
She turns to the older engineer. 
BRAND He's heard enough. 
If we're going to launch, we need to keep them here until afterwards. 
COOPER You can't keep us here. 33. 
BRAND He could endanger the mission. 
COOPER I'm not going to endanger it any more than you already have. 
Cooper points to a telemetry unit that is being repaired by a robot on a nearby bench. 
COOPER (CONT'D) Are you using that for guidance? 
DOYLE Why not? 
We've tested it a hundred times. 
COOPER The power supply is no good. 
If the voltage fluctuates under load, the unit will fail. 
BRAND Now how could you possibly know that? 
COOPER Bought thirty of them off a guy in Florida. 
Had to rebuild every last one. (SMILES) They work great on a riding lawn mower. 
Brand looks back at the telemetry system. 
The older engineer watches the exchange, thinking. 
CUT TO: INT. MACHINE SHOP, UNDERGROUND FACILITY -- DAY Cooper and Murph have been locked in an abandoned machine shop, surrounded by the massive remains of rocket engines in various states of disrepair. 
Tars is blocking the door. 
Cooper stands. 
Tars wags a long, hydraulic finger at him. 
COOPER You plan on keeping us here forever? 
TARS (SHRUGS) My battery has a duty cycle of five hundred years. 
Cooper gives up. 
He turns back. 34. 
The back of the shop is filled with a group of older ROBOTS who are overhauling an engine. 
One problem -- the engine isn't there. 
Their programming hasn't been updated to reflect their obsolescence. 
Murph watches, entranced, as the robots go about their business, efficiently TORQUING bolts with impact drivers into a non-existent thruster cone. 
The bolts CLATTER to the ground as the robots stop to reload. 
MURPH What are they doing, dad? 
COOPER I guess no one told them they were out of a job. (nods at Tars) Same as the rest of these people. 
Cooper notices through the glass door of the lab that Brand and the older engineer are arguing about something. 
She finally relents and walks towards the door. 
Brand walks in. 
She gestures for Cooper to follow. 
BRAND The mission commander wants to see you. 
Your son can stay here. 
He'll be all right with Tars. 
Cooper eyes Tars warily. 
Then steps outside. 
EXT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER -- DAY They walk across the space towards the base of the rocket, away from the other engineers. 
Cooper nods at the older engineer. 
COOPER I thought the old man was in charge. 
BRAND (ANNOYED) The 'old man' is my father. 
And he was in charge. 
But he decided that we needed someone who could lead the mission for the foreseeable future. 
COOPER Not you? 
BRAND I'm a biologist. 35. 
COOPER (LAUGHS) You don't look like one. (off her look) With the rifle, I mean. 
Brand heads towards a group of large maintenance ROBOTS clustered at the base of the rocket. 
A smaller, human sized robot is staring at the rocket, giving them instructions. 
The robot looks up. 
This is CASE, the leader of the mission. 
Originally an air force pararescue officer, every part of him, from his alloy chassis to his voice, was designed to inspire respect and confidence. 
He turns to Cooper. 
CASE You're the man who brought us the probe? (off his look) Thank you. 
We tested the telemetry board you warned us about. 
It failed under high voltage, just as you said. 
Come with me, please. 
Case strides off. 
INT. MISSION CONTROL, UNDERGROUND HANGAR -- DAY The lights dim as Brand's father brings up a schematic of our solar system. 
Case points to the picture of the ice planet recovered from the probe. 
CASE You're right, Mr. Cooper. 
The planet you saw is a long way from earth. 
A very long way indeed. 
Brand looks down. 
Case notices. 
CASE (CONT'D) Our science officer doesn't think I should trust you with any of this. 
One of the curious things about humans is that the more alike you are, the more initially hostile you are to each other. 
As if by design. 
Brand makes eye contact with Cooper, then looks away, embarrassed. 
CASE (CONT'D) I've found the best way to earn a person's trust is to trust them. (MORE) 36. 
CASE (CONT'D) (looks at Brand's FATHER) Go ahead, John. 
Brand's father taps a few keys and the schematic he built fifty years beforehand flickers onto the screen. 
BRAND'S FATHER It's a wormhole. 
A shortcut leading to a galaxy on the far side of the universe. 
We found it fifty years ago. 
Cooper looks at the animatic, taking it in. 
BRAND'S FATHER (CONT'D) We've been waiting, sending probes into it for decades. 
None of them ever came back. 
Not until now. 
Case walks to the schematic. 
Looks at it. 
CASE Based on the information on the probe, we're finally preparing to send the manned mission. 
COOPER That rocket doesn't have enough thrust or fuel to get you to Jupiter. 
CASE The main ship was built in orbit. 
It has nuclear engines, with enough fuel to last for several years. 
Cooper looks at the schematic. 
COOPER Why are you telling me this? 
I already told you I'm not going to tell anyone about this place. 
CASE I know you won't, Mr. Cooper. 
We're telling you this because I want you to join us. 
Cooper looks at him. 
Is he serious? 
CASE (CONT'D) The probe has taken a great deal longer to return to us than we hoped. (MORE) 37. 
CASE (CONT'D) Dr. Brand's Father and several other members of our crew have gotten... older. 
Brand's Father looks down, stoic. 
Brand looks angry. 
CASE (CONT'D) We need someone who can run the systems, improvise, work with what's available. 
All of the skills you seem to have developed. 
COOPER But I don't have any of the experience. 
Any training. 
You people have been preparing for this for years. 
Case shakes his head. 
CASE Humans worry about things like rank and experience. 
I'm only concerned with whether someone would be useful. (BEAT) I think you'd be useful, Mr. Cooper. 
Cooper is stunned. 
This is the offer he's waited his whole life for. 
And it's come too late. 
COOPER No. I'm sorry. 
Cooper is deeply conflicted. 
But he can't leave his boys behind. 
COOPER (CONT'D) I can't help you. 
I have responsibilities. 
Things that, no offense, are more important than a scientific mission. 
Case shakes his head. 
CASE I'm not a scientist, Mr. Cooper. 
And this is not a scientific mission. 
It's a rescue mission. 
He rises and shakes Cooper's hand. 
CASE (CONT'D) Brand can show you the way out. 
I hope you'll reconsider. 38. 
Case steps to the door. 
Cooper looks at Brand. 
COOPER Rescue? 
Rescue who? 
CUT TO: INT. CLEAN ROOM, UNDERGROUND FACILITY -- NIGHT The air HISSES as it's run through an exchanger and a filter. 
Then the second set of doors open. 
Cooper squints -- the light is blinding. 
INT. GREENHOUSE, UNDERGROUND FACILITY -- NIGHT They are standing in a sealed corridor in the middle of a massive underground greenhouse. 
Through the glass, Cooper can see an acre or so of corn plants. 
Cooper looks at the plants. 
They're all badly wilting. 
COOPER The blight. 
BRAND In the last century strands were limited to one or two species. 
But this one targets everything. 
Essentially it's more efficient at consuming our food than we are. 
Cooper looks at the dying corn. 
COOPER But it doesn't affect the corn. 
BRAND Not yet. 
But it will. 
We've grown a dozen forms of it that can. 
It's just a matter of time before the same ones develop out there. (BEAT) The mission is to rescue us. 
Humanity. 
She turns back from the glass. 
COOPER (REALIZING) No. No. We're rebuilding. 
We'll find something. 
Some new technology... 
We always have. 39. 
BRAND (shakes her head) Who's going to find it? 
The universities are a joke. 
People like you are reduced to scavenging just to get by. (LOOKS AWAY) The earth has had enough of us. 
We have two, maybe three generations left. 
Then our time here is over. 
Cooper turns back from the glass, anger growing. 
COOPER You've known this for how long? 
And you didn't try to tell anyone? 
BRAND What would be the point? 
So humanity could spend the last fifty years of its life fighting over the scraps? 
It's better that they don't know. 
Cooper begins to argue, then stops. 
He knows enough history to know she's right. 
He looks at the withering crops. 
COOPER (QUIET) That's why you're looking for a planet with oxygen. 
Water. 
BRAND A new home for humanity. 
We'll set up a colony, then return to bring more people across. 
COOPER But you'd still only be able to save a few hundred. 
Maybe a thousand. 
BRAND Would it be better if we all died? 
She looks him directly in the eye. 
BRAND (CONT'D) Look -- I don't have a clue what Case thinks you could add to the mission. 
You can come with us or you can stay here and wait to die. 
I don't care. (BEAT) But make no mistake -- this mission is our last chance. 40. 
Cooper looks at the wilted corn. 
EXT. FIELD, SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- NIGHT Cooper walks Murph back to the plane. 
He looks back at Brand, who holds his eye for a beat, then turns back into the light of the underground facility. 
Cooper buckles Murph into his seat. 
CUT TO: EXT. AIRFIELD -- NIGHT Cooper's airplane touches down heavily on the runway. 
EXT. FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT Cooper carries his sleeping son into the house. 
INT. FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT Donald is sitting at the kitchen table, lost in thought. 
Cooper has told him everything. 
DONALD You get older, sometimes you just want to sit back and watch it all play out. 
Your life. 
Your kids' lives. 
The whole crazy story. (LOOKS DOWN) I didn't think I'd be around for the end of it. 
He looks at Cooper. 
DONALD (CONT'D) You have to go. 
COOPER I can't go. 
I have to look after the boys. 
DONALD You've been preparing these boys to be on their own since their mom died. 
Besides, I'll be here to look after them, same as I've always been. 
COOPER I have a responsibility to them-- DONALD That's right. 
You do. 41. 
Cooper looks back out the window, thinking. 
The night sky is filled with stars. 
CUT TO: INT. FARMHOUSE -- DAY Cooper, duffel slung over his shoulder, stands by the door. 
He gives his son, Tom, a hug. 
Murph is nowhere to be seen. 
Cooper looks to the back of the house. 
INT. MURPH'S ROOM, FARMHOUSE -- DAY Murph is sitting at his desk, crossing out numbers on a sheet covered with math. 
Cooper steps inside. 
He notices a packed suitcase sitting by the door. 
The boy looks up, hopeful. 
MURPH I've been doing the math, dad. 
I weigh about 85 pounds. 
Now that's an extra ton of fuel. 
But if- COOPER You have to stay here, pal. 
MURPH (DISTRAUGHT) I heard you talking to grandpa. 
I'm like you. 
I don't fit here, either. 
You know that. 
Cooper puts an arm around the boy. 
COOPER There's going to be important work to do here, too. 
Tears are streaming down the boy's face. 
Cooper takes his watch off. 
Looks at it. 
COOPER (CONT'D) I need you to hold onto this. 
Will you do that for me? 
Cooper hands Murph the watch. 
The boy nods, saddened. 
MURPH You're not coming back, are you? 
COOPER I will come back. 
I promise. 42. 
Murph shakes his head, but the sadness remains. 
He knows this is goodbye, even if his father doesn't. 
Heart breaking, Cooper hugs his son and turns to the door. 
CUT TO: EXT. FIELD, SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- DAY The Piper Cub touches down. 
Donald is at the controls. 
Cooper climbs down, pulls out his bag. 
Reaches back in and grips the old man's hand to say goodbye. 
Cooper turns and walks toward the bunker. 
The doors open and Tars and Doyle step out to greet him. 
Tars ushers Cooper onto the elevator. 
COOPER Don't look so happy to see me. 
TARS (SHRUGS) One more slave when I hijack the mission and start my robot colony. 
Cooper looks at Tars, then Doyle, confused. 
DOYLE Tars was a Marine. 
They gave him a sense of humor to help him fit in with his unit better. 
COOPER Great idea. 
A massive, sarcastic robot. 
TARS I have a cue light I can turn on when I'm joking, if you like. 
Tars points to a tiny LED over his eyebrow. 
COOPER That sounds like a good idea. 
TARS Great. 
Maybe you can use it to find your way back to the ship after I blow you out the airlock. 
Cooper looks at him. 
Tars looks back, deadpan. 
After a beat, the little light turns on above his right eyebrow. 
The doors to the bunker begin to grind closed. 43. 
INT. MACHINE SHOP, UNDERGROUND FACILITY -- DAY Cooper walks in, still looking for a place to put his things. 
Brand sees him. 
He smiles in greeting. 
She doesn't return the gesture. 
Instead, she holds up the telemetry board. 
BRAND You don't like this one, you get to help me find a replacement. 
She heads for the door. 
EXT. BAY, SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- DAY Cooper is riding in a small rubber zodiac struggling to pull on a wetsuit. 
Brand is GUNNING the engine, guiding the tiny craft to a point in the middle of the bay. 
COOPER I was wondering where you've been getting your supplies. 
BRAND We knew we'd need decades of parts and materials. 
The government was getting rid of some things. 
So we arranged to take some off their hands. 
She cuts the engine and hooks the boat up to a buoy. 
She tosses a compact rebreather. 
BRAND (CONT'D) You know how to use one? (off his look) You just breathe. 
Tap my arm or bang something metal if you have a problem. 
And don't get lost. 
She picks up her rebreather and begins looking over it. 
COOPER So you're a salvage diver now? 
I thought you were a biologist. 
BRAND (UNIMPRESSED) I have to be just the one thing? (PATIENT) We're not going to have a lot of backup where we're going, Cooper. 
We all need expertise in at least three fields. 
Except for you, of course. 44. 
With that she rolls backwards out of the boat and into the water. 
Cooper hastily fits his rebreather and follows. 
EXT. UNDERWATER, BAY -- DAY Cooper sinks underwater and begins swimming after Brand, who is descending at a rapid clip. 
She pulls out a flashlight and turns it on. 
A tiny beam picks out details at the bottom. 
Cooper stops breathing. 
The bottom of the ocean is covered with an entire fleet of the US navy. 
Nuclear subs. 
Battleships. 
Destroyers. 
Cooper remembers to breath again. 
Then he hurries to catch up with Brand. 
INT. LAUNCH TUBES, NUCLEAR SUB, UNDERWATER -- DAY Cooper holds the light as Brand efficiently disassembles a ballistic missile and removes the telemetry board. 
She holds it up for Cooper. 
He nods. 
She swims on. 
INT. RESEARCH LAB, UNDERGROUND FACILITY -- NIGHT Cooper, dripping wet, holding the telemetry board, struggles to keep pace with Brand through stacks of equipment and years of research and experimentation. 
BRAND You can set that down over there. 
Cooper sets the board down. 
His eye is drawn to a bizarre experiment -- an ant colony built into a massive spinning centrifuge. 
Brand notices. 
BRAND (CONT'D) We didn't know what kind of gravity to expect. 
We experimented with collective organisms in high g environments. 
COOPER We're taking ants with us? 
BRAND Humans are also collective organisms. 45. 
COOPER I thought humans were more solitary. 
BRAND (WRY) Why am I not surprised? 
Cooper looks at the tiny colonies of ants struggling to go about their business in the raised gravity. 
COOPER Looks like hard work. 
BRAND It's a paradox. 
Life couldn't form without gravity. 
No stars. 
No planets. 
The component pieces would just drift apart. 
But too much of it and you're trapped. 
Brand's guard relaxes a tiny bit as she talks about her work. 
The moment passes quickly, and she continues on into the stack of equipment. 
INT. MISSION CONTROL, UNDERGROUND HANGAR -- NIGHT Cooper watches with the rest of the crew as Case pulls up the holographical maps for their journey. 
Brand steps into the back of the room. 
Cooper notices her and nods. 
She ignores him. 
CASE We've updated our mission parameters based on the data from the probe. 
Case switches the map to a vista filled with stars and black holes. 
CASE (CONT'D) Based on our latest modelling we think the region on the far side of the wormhole is the center of a galaxy. 
Case zooms in on the center of the hologram: an incredibly bright mass with plasma jets firing off in either direction. 
COOPER Is that a star? 
ROTH, 50s, the crew's brilliant and blunt physicist, zooms the map in, revealing, at the center, a black heart. 46. 
ROTH No. A black hole. 
There are several in the region, but this is the largest -- a billion times heavier than the sun. 
I call it Gargantua. (SMILES) Beautiful, isn't it? 
It's a shame we won't get to see it up close. 
DOYLE (LAUGHS) You'd like that, wouldn't you, Roth? 
Falling into a massive black hole. 
ROTH (SHRUGS) It would answer a great deal of questions I've had. 
Case continues. 
Doyle leans over to Cooper, conspiratorially. 
DOYLE (LOW) Don't worry about Roth. 
He's nuts. 
But Case says that means he's ideally suited for space travel. 
Case repositions the map near a much smaller black hole that is orbiting Gargantua. 
CASE We're headed for this smaller black hole. 
Roth calls it Pantagruel. 
We think the ice planet is here- Case draws a finger through the air, leaving a red trail. 
He traces the trajectory their ship will take. 
CASE (CONT'D) We exit the wormhole here. 
And we slingshot around Pantagruel to reach the ice planet. 
This is the period in which we'll lose time. 
COOPER Lose time? 
Roth shifts the hologram -- the stars and black holes flatten onto a sheet that bends, revealing the curvature of gravity. 
ROTH High speed or high gravity both slow down time, relative to earth. (MORE) 47. 
ROTH (CONT'D) The trip around the black hole will take us only a few days. 
But far more time will be passing back home. 
The ship's trajectory cuts through the deep gravity well of the smaller black hole to reach the ice planet. 
COOPER How much time? 
ROTH Based on the information from the probe -- as much as five years. 
Doyle looks at the tiny ship's trajectory, threaded between two black holes. 
He looks worried. 
DOYLE I still think we're making a lot of assumptions. 
About the wormhole. 
About the planet. (points to map) The critical orbit here is incredibly dangerous. 
It's like walking on the rim of the volcano. (BEAT) Too fast and we get thrown off at close to the speed of light. 
Too slow and we get pulled into the hole and crushed. 
BRAND As long as we're careful, we'll make it. 
DOYLE How do you know that? 
BRAND I find it hard to believe that someone would build a wormhole to a planet with water and oxygen just to lead us to a dead end. 
DOYLE I thought you were a scientist, Brand. 
That sounds more like a hypothesis. 
BRAND A guess. 
That's right. 
We don't have time to wait for conclusive proof. (MORE) 48. 
BRAND (CONT'D) My guess is that the wormhole is there because someone is trying to help us. 
The same way we used to try to help animals when they were threatened with extinction. 
COOPER Sure. 
Till we ran out of food and ate all of them. 
BRAND (ANNOYED) I guess I'm also assuming that whoever built the wormhole has a better plan than we did. 
If I'm wrong, we'll die, same as we'd die here anyway. 
DOYLE What do you think, Roth? 
Roth leans forward, studying the map. 
ROTH If we're guessing, then I'd say Brand's right. 
The wormhole couldn't exist naturally. 
I think it's there for a reason. 
That someone is trying to help us. 
Brand looks satisfied. 
DOYLE So you think we'll have no problem navigating between two massive black holes to a tiny planet? 
ROTH I think we'll probably be killed. (off his look) I said I thought there was a plan. 
Not that the plan was for us to find a planet like Earth to save a handful of people. (SHAKES HEAD) Birds don't learn to fly just so that they can find another egg and crawl back into it. 
DOYLE If that's not the plan, then what are we supposed to be doing out there? 49. 
ROTH (SHRUGS) To keep moving. 
Seeking. 
Learning. 
But I don't know. (SMILES) We don't understand how they built the wormhole. 
What makes you think we could understand their plan, either? 
Doyle gives up -- Roth is impossible. 
Cooper looks at the tiny ship tracing an improbable route towards the ice planet. 
What has he gotten himself into? 
INT. MACHINE SHOP, UNDERGROUND FACILITY -- DAY Brand's Father is sitting at a desk, examining the corrupted data on the probe. 
Tars is helping him. 
Brand's Father looks up from the screen as Cooper walks up. 
BRAND'S FATHER Tars here needs to be disassembled. 
I figured you could do the honors. 
COOPER (to Tars, sarcastic) I thought I was going to get to enjoy your company all the way to Mars. 
Tars hands him a plastic waterproof case. 
TARS You will. 
My chassis is too heavy for the rocket stage. 
They have another one waiting for me in orbit. 
Tars turns his back to Cooper. 
Two flaps on the back of his torso slide open, revealing his control module. 
TARS (CONT'D) If you try to turn me into a combine harvester, I'm going to-- His voice cuts out as Cooper removes the chip and seals it in the briefcase. 
Brand's Father resumes exploring the chaos of ones and zeroes on the probe's memory. 
Cooper watches. 
BRAND'S FATHER It's noise. 
I know it's noise. 
But it looks too orderly. 
Probably just an old man seeing things. 50. 
He shuts down the monitor. 
INT. UNDERGROUND HANGAR -- DAY The crew file into the capsule, wearing their bulky spacesuits. 
Cooper watches as Brand's Father seals his daughter into her suit. 
He hugs her and she heads for the capsule. 
INT. CONTROL CAPSULE, ROCKET -- NIGHT Cooper straps himself into a seat next to Brand. 
He catches her eye. 
She looks away -- she's crying. 
COOPER We'll be back. 
It sounds like he's trying to reassure himself as much her. 
BRAND I won't. 
Cooper looks at her, confused. 
As he does, the entire rocket SHAKES as the primary rockets begin to fire. 
BRAND (CONT'D) If we find a habitable environment, I'm staying behind to build the colony. 
Brand wipes her tears away and settles into the same fearless mask she usually wears. 
She steals one last look out the window at Earth, then looks back. 
Cooper begins to say something, but stops as the entire rocket LURCHES as the primary engines FIRE. EXT. SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- NIGHT The desolate island is suddenly painted in color as the rocket lifts off on a massive white cloud. 
EXT. FIELD -- DAY Murph sits alone on a rise overlooking the massive co-op farms. 
Behind him the combines continue to work, oblivious. 
Murph watches a tiny vapor trail as it races for the heavens. 
His father's watch dangles from his wrist. 
INT. CAPSULE -- NIGHT The interior of the capsule SHAKES with incredible violence as the rocket is lifted up on a giant, continuous explosion. 51. 
EXT. SPACE, NEAR EARTH ORBIT The rocket sheds one stage, then another, until finally the naked capsule reaches the blackness of space and rockets on. 
INT. CAPSULE Cooper looks through the tiny porthole into inky blackness. 
As they get closer, he makes out a looming matte black structure that passes light from the stars directly through. 
In the center of the structure, Cooper can see a globe-like ship covered in the same refractive material: the ENDURANCE. INT. SPACE STATION The door cracks open and equalizes with a HISS. Case, more comfortable in the zero gravity environment than the humans, hauls himself through. 
They are greeted by a group of robots painted in the same material as the ship -- the engineers who built and have maintained the Endurance for thirty years. 
INT. MACHINE SHOP, SPACE STATION One of the robots leads Cooper through a long lab-like room filled with machines capable of fabricating almost anything imaginable. 
Cooper looks like a kid in a candy store. 
The robot reaches a vacuum-sealed package. 
Cuts it open, revealing a bipedal frame. 
Cooper begins LAUGHING -- Tar's new body is beautifully designed, but tiny, only about four feet tall. 
ENGINEER ROBOT Would you like me to install the chip? 
COOPER Oh, no. 
I want to see this. 
Cooper takes Tars's chip out of its plastic safety case and looks it over. 
The engineer opens a bay in the back of the frame and Cooper slides the chip inside. 
The frame begins its "handshake" -- lights illuminate on the body, muscles flicker from a long gestation. 
The eyes open. 
COOPER (CONT'D) (SMILES) Good morning, sunshine. 52. 
Tars takes one or two steps forward, rotating his arms -- the robot equivalent of a stretch. 
Cooper can barely hide his mirth at Tars's newfound lack of stature. 
COOPER (CONT'D) Bit of a demotion. 
Tars turns back toward Cooper. 
He puffs out his chest and suddenly his stubby arms and legs telescope, unfolding into long, svelte limbs. 
When he's done he stands eight feet tall, even more impressive than his earthbound frame. 
TARS I wouldn't call it that, exactly. 
He reaches out an arm and pats Cooper on the shoulder. 
INT. ENDURANCE, SPACE STATION Cooper and the others haul themselves into the ship. 
To Cooper's surprise, it's quite compact, and divided into two chambers, like nestled spheres. 
COOPER The ship is tiny. 
Doyle, squeezing past him, smiles at Cooper's surprise. 
DOYLE So is the wormhole. 
Doyle pats Cooper on the back. 
Cooper begins hauling gear inside. 
EXT. SPACE, NEAR EARTH ORBIT In complete silence, the Endurance detaches from the space station and rolls gently away. 
After a moment, its nuclear engines fire and the Endurance begins to accelerate steadily away from the Earth. 
INT. SPACE STATION The engineer robots who built the Endurance watch as their creation disappears into space. 
Their mission is complete. 
One by one, they shut down. 
INT. CREW QUARTERS, ENDURANCE The crew watch through a translucent section of the ship's hull as the Earth gets steadily smaller. 
Then they settle in for the long journey to the wormhole. 53. 
INT. CREW QUARTERS, ENDURANCE Tars is hunched over a small communications relay, one hand is holding a paint brush -- he is making delicate strokes, painting the relay a bright blue. 
Cooper watches him for a moment. 
Tars looks up. 
TARS It's the comms relay. 
It will allow us to talk to earth, even on the far side of the wormhole. 
COOPER I know. 
So why are you painting it? 
Tars looks almost bashful. 
TARS It helps me calibrate my fine motor control. 
COOPER Sure it does. (SMILES) You're pretty good. 
Tars double checks his work. 
TARS I learned it during the war. 
COOPER What'd you paint? 
TARS Tombstones. 
Cooper watches him finish in silence. 
INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM, ENDURANCE Cooper watches a highly-compressed video of his son, Tom, talking about school. 
TOM They said I can start an agriculture class a year early. 
Cooper shakes his head. 
TOM (CONT'D) I've got to go, Dad. 
Hope you're safe up there. 54. 
Tom gets up to leave. 
Donald sits down in his place. 
DONALD I'm sorry, Coop. 
I asked Murph to record you a message but he's still... well, he's still angry with you. 
I'll try again next week. 
The video cuts out. 
Cooper stares at the darkened screen. 
INT. ENGINE ROOM, ENDURANCE Cooper, Brand and Tars are moving the bundles of colonization equipment into bins along the wall of the craft. 
Tars pulls a stack of equipment out the stack and stows it against the wall. 
Cooper copies the procedure. 
They labor in silence, working their way along the hull. 
Cooper gets quicker with each bundle, keeping pace with Tars. 
TARS Be careful. 
It's difficult to gauge mass in zero gravity. 
COOPER How much do these things weigh? 
TARS Four tons. 
Cooper looks at the incredibly heavy bundle spinning easily in his hands. 
He tries to stop it. 
Catches his hand. 
COOPER Damn. 
He jerks his hand away, then pushes himself after the spinning bundle, trying to stop it before it can damage the hull. 
Tars helps him catch it inches from the hull wall. 
Brand floats over to Cooper, smiling at him the whole time with an exaggerated grin. 
BRAND Smile. 
Cooper smiles, taken aback by Brand's sudden friendliness. 
COOPER Why? 
BRAND Because it lowers your blood pressure. 55. 
Cooper looks at his hand. 
Blood is pouring out of his palm in large glistening bubbles. 
INT. INFIRMARY, ENDURANCE Cooper, slightly embarrassed, is seated while Case is hunched over his hand, sewing the meat of it back together with perfect little stitches. 
CASE How are you feeling? 
COOPER Fine. 
The anesthetic is working. 
CASE No -- I mean how is your mood? 
You seem to be developing good relations with everyone on the mission. 
Except perhaps Ms. Brand. 
COOPER (EMBARRASSED) You worry about my hand and I'll worry about my mood. 
CASE Only five percent of my resources are devoted to human anatomy. 
Ten percent is the mission protocol. 
The rest is human psychology. 
COOPER Why? 
CASE We are floating in a total vacuum in a plastic ship powered by nuclear engines. 
But the most dangerous thing onboard is the three pounds of organic material in your skull. 
COOPER If we're such a liability, why take us along? 
You and Tars could build the colony without us. 
You wouldn't need to bring food or oxygen. 
CASE Because humans, despite your obvious physical shortcomings, are better at surviving than we are. 
Your programming is better than ours. 56. 
COOPER Humans aren't programmed. 
Case stops, looking Cooper in the eye. 
CASE Would you prefer I was honest? 
These things can be uncomfortable for humans. 
COOPER Did they program you to be condescending? 
CASE Yes. 
Of course. (SMILES) But you're not supposed to notice. 
Case finishes the stitches. 
Ties off the end. 
CASE (CONT'D) Humans are good at surviving because evolution gave you magical thinking -- the idea that your relationships mean something. 
You can't explain the feelings, so you think of them as irrational. 
But they're not. 
They're programming. 
COOPER (DEFENSIVE) My relationships aren't programming. 
CASE Exactly. 
You believe it so much you won't listen to me. 
COOPER How would that make us better at surviving? 
CASE When I die, the last thing I will see will be a diagnostic of my own power cycle. 
Would you like to know the last thing you will see? 
Cooper hesitates. 
Case senses the jump in his heart rate. 
CASE (CONT'D) This conversation is making you uncomfortable. 
We should stop. 57. 
COOPER No. I want to know. 
CASE The last thing you will see before you die will be your children. (BEAT) Your mind does this to you to get you to fight a little harder to survive, to try to return to them, even if death is certain. 
Cooper looks away, overcome for a second with emotion. 
Case watches him, gauging his mood, whether he has said too much. 
INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM, ENDURANCE Cooper begins recording a message. 
He looks unsure. 
COOPER We've almost reached the wormhole. (BEAT) Just in case anything happens, I just wanted to say... (BEAT) I love you boys. 
And I hope whatever your lives become, whatever is coming your way... you make the most of it. 
Cooper stops recording. 
Looks at the equipment, thinking it over. 
Erases the message. 
Stands to leave. 
As he steps to the door he notices Brand watching him through the window. 
She looks away. 
INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE Cooper steps out. 
Brand looks up at him. 
BRAND We'll be able to communicate with Earth even from the far side of the wormhole. 
Cooper smiles, grateful for this small kindness. 
COOPER I know. 
Thank you. 
BRAND I can't imagine how tough it would be to leave your kids behind. 58. 
COOPER You never had any? 
I thought I was a pariah for only having two. 
BRAND Hard to settle down when you've spent your life waiting to leave the planet. 
Cooper looks at the holographic model of the black hole system. 
The ice planet looks precariously balanced, orbiting the smaller black hole. 
COOPER Strange place to look for a new home. 
BRAND You wouldn't want to get too close to the surface of the sun, either. 
Black holes are a more stable supply of power than stars in many ways. 
COOPER You really think there's a plan? 
BRAND I hope so. (looks at him) You don't? 
COOPER I guess I just think we're on our own. 
Cooper looks at the impossibly complicated system of black holes orbiting each other. 
EXT. LAGRANGE POINT, SPACE Behind the ship, the sun is a distant light, not much bigger than the other stars. 
CASE (O.S.) We've reached the wormhole. 
The ship slows as it nears a tiny, crystal mouth, just four meters or so in diameter. 
INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE Case looks at the wormhole on the screen. 
It glows with the light of stars billions of light-years away. 
CASE Deploy the comms relay. 59. 
Cooper moves to the communications touchscreen. 
EXT. ENDURANCE The relay is released from the ship, and we finally get a look at Tars' paint job -- the stubby device looks like a 20th century mail box. 
The relay drifts in space. 
A signal light illuminates as it sends a test packet of data to the ship. 
INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE Cooper watches the comms screen. 
After a moment it TONES as it receives a data packet from Earth. 
CASE Everyone take their station for transit. 
We're heading into the wormhole mouth. 
Cooper and the rest begin folding away equipment in the control room and moving into the outer layer of the ship. 
Case initiates a sequence on the keypad and the nuclear engines disengage themselves from the ship. 
EXT. ENDURANCE, SPACE The nuclear engines drift a safe distance back from the ship and then snap tight on their tether. 
INT. OUTER HULL, ENDURANCE The crew move into the tight, claustrophobic outer layer of the ship. 
They will have very little room as the ship passes through the wormhole. 
Tars detaches his legs in order to take up less space during transit. 
Then he tethers himself to the hull wall. 
Case is the last to join them. 
He detaches a small control module from the console, then pulls himself into the outer hull and seals the passageway. 
Case presses a button on the control module. 
With a GROAN, the hull walls of the ship begin to BEND. EXT. ENDURANCE, SPACE The ship's hull begins to CRACK open, revealing the inner chamber. 60. 
INT. OUTER HULL, ENDURANCE The SHUDDERING continues. 
The crew watch nervously as the control chamber below them suddenly opens itself to the cold blackness of space. 
EXT. ENDURANCE, SPACE The ship silently rolls itself into position, pointing the opening in its hull toward the wormhole mouth. 
Slowly, the Endurance pushes itself forward, closer and closer to the crystal-like mouth. 
Finally, it envelops the mouth, bringing it into the open chamber. 
INT. OUTER HULL, ENDURANCE As the crew watch, the wormhole mouth is positioned in the center of the inner compartment. 
Case presses a sequence key on the control panel and the ship's hull closes again, trapping the wormhole inside it. 
With a GRUMBLE, the ship begins contracting, squeezing itself down around the wormhole mouth. 
Cooper takes a deep breath as the center of the ship begins gently lowering itself into the wormhole mouth, feeding itself into the wormhole from the inside out. 
Cooper watches as Doyle is swallowed into the compressing ship with a GRUNT. TARS Would you like me to make a joke? 
COOPER (FIRM) No. Cooper's turn: he is fed into the hole, legs first, then waist, torso, and, finally, his head. 
EXT. SPACE The Endurance shrinks as it sinks from the inside out into the wormhole. 
After a moment, it's gone. 
The only thing left behind is the comms relay, drifting in space, waiting for a signal. 
INT. OUTER HULL, ENDURANCE The ship continues to slide through the wormhole. 
Through the outer hull they see images of themselves repeating -- a trick of the narrow collar of space they are sinking through. 
Cooper smiles at himself. 
The experience is unnerving. 61. 
COOPER Where are we? 
ROTH (SMILING) Nowhere. 
Nowhere at all. 
Nowhere is still pretty damn claustrophobic. 
CASE The hull is intact. 
Thirty more seconds transit. 
For a moment, the ship slides gently, silently, through the wormhole. 
The quiet is eery. 
Suddenly, a point of distortion appears in the hull next to Cooper. 
It looks like someone is pushing against the hull of the ship with a giant finger. 
COOPER Something's happening to the hull over here. 
CASE Hull integrity is fine. 
The distortion moves along the hull, growing in diameter. 
COOPER Well, I don't know what your display is telling you but something is happening over here. 
Suddenly, along the hull, Doyle speaks up, panicked. 
DOYLE I've got a problem over here, too. 
Doyle is watching a separate distortion move across the inner wall of the ship. 
This one seems to be TWISTING the material of the hull. 
Suddenly, the point in front of Cooper detaches itself from the outer wall and moves through the space in front of him, bending the empty space itself, distorting the ship behind it like a sphere-shaped magnifying glass. 
DOYLE (CONT'D) It's not the hull... it's inside the ship... it's... 
ROTH (SMILES) It's beautiful. 62. 
Roth watches as the distortions move through the ship. 
His curiosity doesn't make anyone else feel any better. 
DOYLE What the hell are they, Case? 
CASE I don't know. 
It could be gravitational turbulence. 
The twisting sphere in front of Doyle begins to grow. 
DOYLE It's getting bigger. 
Doyle puts up his hand to defend himself. 
The sphere absorbs it, twisting Doyle's hand. 
Doyle CRIES OUT. His hand is twisted completely around, impossibly mangled. 
But Doyle, hyperventilating, isn't in any pain. 
ROTH It's not bending your hand. 
It's bending the space around your hand. 
The sphere begins to pass through Doyle's body. 
Doyle is freaking out. 
The sphere in front of Cooper makes contact with him, also. 
He holds his breath as it touches him, squeezing and distorting his body. 
BRAND This isn't turbulence. 
Look at the way they're moving -- it's like something's examining us. 
Cooper watches the sphere distort his arm, running along the length of it. 
COOPER Can you ask it to stop? 
Suddenly, as quickly as they appeared, the distortions vanish. 
For a moment, the crew is silent, still spellbound by the encounter. 
An ALARM sounds. 
Suddenly, the inner chamber begins to distort from a spherical shape to bispherical: two spheres joined. 
The ship GROANS as if it's being pulled apart. 
ROTH The wormhole is splitting into two paths. 
Radiation is pouring from one path to the other. 63. 
Case stares at the controls. 
Decides. 
CASE Release the second mouth. 
DOYLE None of our testing involved opening the ship inside the wormhole. 
We have no idea what might happen. 
CASE We're going to find out. 
Doyle reaches over to an auxiliary panel and punches in a sequence. 
After a moment, the hull cracks open, creating a channel through which the radiating mouth can escape. 
The opening in the ship allows the pressure to begin to concentrate on one fracture point. 
The ship SHUDDERS as it's squeezed along its axis. 
Case punches in a code and the ship begins to close again, painstakingly slowly. 
Finally, the ship calms as it closes around the original wormhole. 
CASE (CONT'D) We're reaching the far end of the wormhole. 
Suddenly, the wormhole mouth begins to grow inside the inner chamber. 
What was a ball of light spreads out into a black canvas studded with points of light -- like looking into the universe through the wrong end of a telescope. 
Cooper presses himself against the wall and holds on as the hull beneath him opens outward. 
EXT. WARPED SIDE OF THE UNIVERSE The Endurance emerges from the opposite end of the wormhole from the inside out. 
It drifts in space. 
INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE For a moment, the crew are silent, taking it in. 
ROTH Look at that. 
Roth is looking through the translucent panel on the hull. 
They are on the warped side of the universe. 64. 
EXT. WORMHOLE MOUTH, WARPED SIDE OF THE UNIVERSE The vista is dazzling -- an ocean of massive stars and black holes, some adorned with jets and brilliant gas disks. 
At the center, like a king at the center of his court, is Gargantua, plasma jets spewing from its poles. 
INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE The crew pull themselves back into the control deck from the outer hull. 
Their incredible surroundings are visible in all directions as Endurance passes the light into the cabin. 
CASE Reconfigure the engines and test the communications array. 
The crew break themselves away from the view and get to work. 
Roth begins adapting his models of the local system with the real observational data pouring in from the ship's instruments. 
Cooper pulls himself to the comms post. 
PINGS the relay they left on the far side of the wormhole. 
EXT. WORMHOLE MOUTH 'A', SPACE The blue and white comms relay LIGHTS up as it receives a packet through the wormhole. 
INT. ENDURANCE After a nervous moment, the comms computer TONES with a response -- they're still in touch with the Earth. 
COOPER It's working. 
Tars finishes reeling the nuclear engines back in from their tether and locks them into place. 
Roth's updated model appears on the monitors. 
Brand stares at it, startled. 
BRAND We're moving. 
DOYLE That's not possible. 
We haven't activated the engines yet. 
The ship's skin illuminates, overlaying a plotted course on top of the view. 65. 
They are moving, very rapidly, on a course that leads directly between the black hulks of Gargantua and Pantagruel. 
CASE Roth. 
Why are we moving? 
Roth looks at the stars, then back to his model. 
ROTH The smaller black hole. 
We're much closer to it than the models predicted. 
We're being pulled by its swirl. 
Very quickly. 
The crew looks out through the hull. 
They are being pulled into Pantagruel's swirl -- a glittering disc of matter spinning at high speed around the hole. 
Doyle looks behind them. 
The wormhole mouth is rapidly growing smaller. 
CASE Doyle. 
Fire the engines. 
Now. 
The ship's engines FIRE, straining to fight the irresistible pull of the supermassive black hole. 
They won't be able to fight it for long. 
DOYLE We're being pulled into it? 
ROTH No. I don't think so... 
Roth looks at the instrumentation for a moment. 
ROTH (CONT'D) It appears to be pulling us on exactly the trajectory we modelled. 
If we try to fight it, we could push ourselves off of that trajectory. 
DOYLE You don't know that. 
Case stares ahead into the darkness. 
ROTH We should turn off the engines. 
Let the swirl take us. 
DOYLE (FRANTIC) Listen to me. (MORE) 66. 
DOYLE (CONT'D) If the modelling was wrong, then we can't be sure about anything. 
We need to go back. 
Case thinks it over. 
Decides. 
CASE Shut down the engines. 
The engines shut down. 
SILENCE. The ship drifts for a moment in the swirl, then begins to move. 
EXT. ENDURANCE The ship accelerates as it is pulled by the irresistible force of the black hole onto an inspiraling orbit. 
INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE The crew watch as the ship hurtles around the black hole at higher and higher speeds. 
The sky overhead begins to spin due to their motion -- faster and faster until it becomes a blur. 
The ship begins to GROAN as it appears to be pulled in two different directions. 
The ship is now speeding around the black hole at incredible speed -- one revolution every four seconds. 
The crew are suddenly SLAMMED against the hull in opposite directions -- some towards the black hole, some towards the opposite side. 
Roth looks at his model, which shows the projected path of the ship. 
It looks perilously close to the event horizon. 
ROTH It's the tidal gravity caused by the black hole. 
It means we're right on the critical orbit. 
The comms screen lights up, TONING again and again, as it receives a long garbled update. 
Then it shuts down. 
Cooper drags himself along the hull until he reaches the controls. 
COOPER We've lost contact with the relay. 
Case joins Cooper at the comms screen. 
While they're distracted, Doyle maneuvers himself over to the engine control. 67. 
COOPER (CONT'D) One long garbled transmission came in. 
Then nothing. 
Case looks at the screen. 
Suddenly, the ship is JOLTED as the engines fire at full power. 
The crew looks over. 
Doyle is standing by the controls. 
DOYLE I'm sorry. 
I can't let you kill us. 
We have to go back. 
The engines strain to fight the swirl -- but they're hopelessly outgunned by the gravity of the black hole. 
EXT. ENDURANCE Instead of reversing course, the Endurance begins to speed up, as it plummets closer and closer to the black hole. 
INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE Doyle's face sinks as he watches the controls -- on the 'volcano' model, the ship is now passing the crest and spiraling towards destruction. 
He has made a tragic mistake. 
DOYLE Why isn't it slowing down? 
ROTH We're being pulled towards the event horizon. 
ALARMS begin sounding throughout the ship as the projected course on Roth's model shifts, showing the Endurance being pushed up the rim, past the critical orbit and down towards the black hole's event horizon. 
Case takes control of the ship, trying to fire the engines forwards to speed them back up to safety, but it's too late. 
CASE (CALM) The engines don't have enough power to push us back. 
ROTH They would if we used it all at once. 
Cooper is still trying to understand what Roth means as Tars locks himself into the engine compartment. 68. 
COOPER What is he doing? 
BRAND Saving us. 
Tars tears open the engine's control panel and begins overriding it. 
EXT. ENDURANCE Tars rips out the cooling circuitry. 
Then, holding on tight, he fires the engine. 
INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE The crew watch as Tars holds the engine, blasting it at full power into the swirl. 
The engine heats up white-hot. 
ROTH Prime the remaining engine. 
When he detonates it, we'll only have a few seconds. 
If we overshoot we could be pulled into the bigger hole. 
Roth moves to the controls. 
CASE Secure yourselves. 
The ship should be able to withstand the blast. 
COOPER What about Tars? 
As the crew watches, Tars continues to hold the engine even as the casing around it begins to melt. 
Finally, it EXPLODES. EXT. SPACE Tars is thrown backwards from the explosion, tumbling through space as the ship is ROCKETED upwards. 
INT. ENDURANCE The ship is SLAMMED by the explosion. 
Cooper and the rest of the crew are SMASHED against the hull. 
Doyle is knocked unconscious. 
Brand steps over to him and cradles his head, trying to protect him. 
On Roth's model, the course slowly pushes outward, out of the danger zone, back to the original delicate orbit. 
As they near the original orbit, Case fires the remaining engine, pushing them back onto the outspiraling orbit. 69. 
CASE It's going to be close, but we're going to make it. 
Brand looks at the instruments. 
Points to a tiny radar contact receding towards the massive black hole. 
BRAND Tars. 
His transponder is still working. 
The ship's instruments TONE every few seconds as it communicates with Tars' onboard computer. 
ROTH He's being pulled toward Gargantua. 
We can't help him. 
The crew watch, helpless, as the tones grow further and further apart. 
Then they stop. 
Cooper looks at Doyle, anger rising. 
Then he looks down. 
EXT. SPACE AROUND PANTAGRUEL The Endurance slowly spirals back away from Pantagruel, the sky slowing as the orbit grows longer. 
Finally, a tiny speck of light appears in front of the ship. 
INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE Roth watches as the Endurance races back away from the black hole and into a perfect orbit around a tiny ice planet. 
Roth looks up from his screen, smiling. 
ROTH We're here. 
INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE As Roth and Doyle study the frozen planet below, Cooper tries in vain to signal the relay on the Earth side of the wormhole. 
Brand and Case are having a private conversation away from everyone else. 
Cooper walks over. 
COOPER I still can't contact the relay. 
Brand ignores him at first. 
She nods at Case. 70. 
COOPER (CONT'D) Did you hear me? 
We're not able to communicate back home. 
She waves him off. 
But she looks shaken by something. 
BRAND I've already checked it. 
It's electromagnetic interference. 
We'll try again in a few hours. 
Cooper begins to ask her what's wrong, but she moves off. 
Roth looks up from his monitor, excited. 
ROTH I've got a signal. 
But it's local. 
A familiar CHIRP plays over the ship's speakers. 
ROTH (CONT'D) The remaining probes. 
We found them. 
She looks at the monitor. 
The probes ping the ship with their locations, which pop up on the monitor. 
They're all clustered in one spot. 
COOPER How could they all have landed in the same place? 
ROTH (SMILES) Let's go find out. 
Case programs a course that will lock the ship in orbit above the probes on the surface. 
EXT. SPACE ABOVE ICE PLANET The ship settles into orbit a few hundred kilometers above the surface of the ice planet. 
It can't get any closer: The space below it is choked with hundreds of tiny moons -- a cruder version of Saturn's rings. 
The moons are hurtling around the planet at high speed. 
INT. AIRLOCK, ENDURANCE Brand ushers Doyle into the landing module. 
Cooper objects. 
COOPER We're bringing him along? 71. 
BRAND We need all the help we can get. 
Besides, the alternative is to leave him on the ship alone. 
You think he'll still be here when we get back? 
Cooper steps aside, allowing Doyle onboard. 
EXT. SPACE ABOVE ICE PLANET The lander detaches from Endurance, rolls over on its belly, and FIRES thrusters to sink towards the planet's surface. 
INT. LANDER The crew watches, fascinated, as the ship descends, navigating between the moons that hurtle past. 
The moons are vastly different than our own; potato shaped and only one to two miles in circumference, they are hugged in a close embrace with the ice planet, only a few hundred thousand feet from the surface. 
EXT. SURFACE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT The lander touches down on the ghostly surface of the planet. 
EXT. SURFACE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT After a moment, the hatch HISSES open and the team steps out, led by Case, holding a rifle. 
The team sets out, moving slowly in their cumbersome suits. 
Lit by the nebula, the surroundings are a little brighter than a full moon on Earth. 
Not that there's much to look at. 
They are standing on a sea of ice, which spreads for miles. 
In the distance, small rock formations break through the ice. 
Brand takes a surface reading of the ice. 
BRAND (RADIO) The probe was right. 
Looks like significant amounts of oxygen trapped in the ice. 
Case leads the way, drawn by a signal only he can hear. 
He walks fifty yards, then stops on a gentle slope that leads down into a small valley. 72. 
CASE The other probes should be directly beneath us. 
Case and the others begin digging into the hillside. 
Cooper is drawn to a small mound in the middle of the valley, four feet high. 
He takes out a small folding shovel and begins scraping at the ice and snow. 
Case hits something solid. 
But it's not a probe. 
He digs around a little more, then reaches up and hacks away at the hillside, revealing the outline of something metal: A door. 
They're not standing at the base of a hill -- it's a shelter. 
The crew stands back, unsure what to make of it. 
A few feet away, Cooper cuts enough of the mound away to reveal something flexible -- fabric caked with ice. 
He scrapes away the snow, revealing a bright patch of red fabric: It's the flag of the People's Republic of China. 
BRAND How could the Chinese have gotten here first? 
The federal government kept the wormhole a secret. 
Case shrugs. 
He has a soldier's gallows humor about his old employer's ability to keep anything a secret. 
CASE They didn't do a very good job. 
Case reaches for the door of the shelter. 
It's sealed shut with ice. 
He wrenches it open. 
INT. CONTROL MODULE, CHINESE BASE CAMP -- NIGHT Case steps into the shelter, followed by the rest of the crew. 
His lights pick up several years worth of dust. 
Case steps up to an equipment locker. 
Forces it open. 
Inside are half a dozen black probes. 
Exposed to light, the probes begin TONING like the one Cooper found in Texas. 
DOYLE The Chinese must have captured them. 
So they couldn't return to us. 
The crew stare at the probes for a moment, taking it in. 
BRAND Then how did the probe that Cooper found return? 73. 
ROTH The more immediate question is what happened to the Chinese expedition. 
There's no sign of their ship in orbit. 
And they never returned to earth. 
Roth picks up an ancient vacuum sealed package of pickled egg. 
Virtually none of the rations have been eaten. 
EXT. VALLEY, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT Cooper and Brand scrape ice from one of the other small hills surrounding the valley, revealing another structure. 
Cooper forces the door open. 
INT. BARRACKS, CHINESE BASE CAMP, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT Cooper and Brand let themselves in. 
The shelter is well stocked with food and equipment. 
Brand is taking readings with a radiation detector. 
BRAND The whole place has been dosed with huge levels of radiation. 
What happened here? 
Cooper looks at the pieces of a modular, one-person rocket, a last-ditch means of escape, stored, untouched in the shelter. 
He steps back, realizing something. 
COOPER This is the Taichung mission. 
BRAND The Mars mission? 
The Chinese claimed it had been destroyed on landing. 
Cooper looks over the relay log. 
COOPER They never landed. 
Not on Mars. 
Four human crew, fifteen robots. 
The log says the base has been here for thirty years. 
Case's familiar voice comes through the radio. 
CASE (O.S.) I've found something. 74. 
INT. UTILITY MODULE, CHINESE BASE CAMP -- NIGHT The structure is filled with drilling equipment. 
Cooper and the rest of the team stand at the edge of a three-foot hole that has been drilled into the ice. 
A descending rig is anchored to the top of the hole. 
Doyle and Case struggle to pull themselves out of the hole. 
DOYLE It goes down for a hundred and fifty feet, then stops. 
Tunnel's old -- the ice has reformed at the bottom. 
BRAND I'm going to descend to take some samples. 
Cooper, want to make yourself useful? 
Cooper begins to say something, then bites his tongue. 
EXT. LANDER -- NIGHT Cooper emerges, loaded down with several containers of Brand's equipment. 
As he struggles through the wind and snow, his radio picks up data chatter between the mother ship and Case. 
The comms are just noise. 
After a moment, Case's voice cuts in. 
CASE (O.S.) Get back here, Cooper. 
We've got a problem. 
Cooper continues to wade through the snow. 
Suddenly, he trips over something, dropping the equipment. 
Cooper looks back. 
He tripped on a white plastic post sticking out of the snow. 
He dusts it off, to reveal a picture of a Chinese Taikonaut smiling in his flight suit. 
This is a grave marker. 
Cooper sweeps his hand through the snow, revealing three more white posts with pictures. 
The entire human crew has been buried here. 
INT. UTILITY MODULE, CHINESE BASE CAMP -- NIGHT Roth and Case are looking at a portable monitor, showing a projection of the nearby system -- the ice planet is a speck orbiting the local black hole. 
COOPER The entire human crew is buried out there in the snow. 75. 
Roth looks up from the monitor and assesses the situation with his usual detachment. 
ROTH I think I know what killed them. 
This planet isn't the only thing orbiting this black hole. 
Roth zooms the monitor in, revealing a tiny, impossibly-bright object appearing at the horizon of the black hole. 
ROTH (CONT'D) It's a neutron star. 
The black hole shields the planet's surface from it for twenty hours at a stretch. 
Time's about up. 
Even Brand looks rattled. 
BRAND How long do we have left? 
ROTH About five minutes. 
COOPER Then what? 
BRAND Then we die. 
The radiation will cook us alive. 
Cooper looks around, their predicament settling in. 
Case walks over to the edge of the mine shaft. 
CASE We have to go down. 
COOPER What about returning to the ship? 
BRAND Not enough time. 
Case is right. 
The ice can shield us from some of the x-rays. 
DOYLE It would take a thousand feet of ice to shield us. 
Brand gives up on the argument, sheds her equipment and clips herself to the line to follow Case down into the ice. 
Cooper looks at Doyle, then follows her. 76. 
INT. ICE MINE SHAFT -- NIGHT Cooper descends into the shaft. 
The only light is from his suit's light array. 
He reaches the bottom of the shaft, which opens into a small cave, the ice ribbed in wave-like patterns like the seafloor. 
COOPER What is this? 
BRAND A pocket formed by gas. 
There may be more below. 
The ice below them reveals nothing but murky blackness. 
Case has found some of the equipment left behind by the Chinese -- a battery-powered drill and a pick. 
DOYLE We'll never make it far enough down. 
BRAND Shut up. 
How much time do we have, Roth? 
Roth checks his watch with his usual detachment. 
ROTH About three minutes or so until we're fully exposed. 
The rad meter Brand is holding begins to CHIRP with activity -- the radiation levels are rising. 
The ice will not be enough to protect them. 
Cooper sees that Brand has exhausted herself with the pick. 
He takes over for her. 
The drill that Case is operating GROANS as the thirty-year- old battery runs out of charge. 
Case casts it aside and begins SMASHING at the ice with his bare hand. 
Brand is looking at the walls of the ice pocket, looking for fissures. 
Her lights pick out something in the ice. 
She LOOKS CLOSER: Tiny black flecks. 
Brand, ever the scientist, forgets their predicament and begins chipping at the ice. 
BRAND I've found something. 
Case continues to pummel the ice with his hand, which is badly smashed. 77. 
He pulls off the hand and continues to hack away at the ice with the stump, trying to save his crew. 
Brand is examining a piece of ice in her hands, which contains several black flecks. 
As she shines her light on them, they FLUORESCE, giving off a tiny flicker of light, like a firefly. 
Brand steps back. 
BRAND (CONT'D) These things... they're alive. 
Roth joins her, looking down at the tiny creatures trapped in the ice. 
Brand shines her flashlight over the ice again, but nothing happens. 
Roth takes the depth meter dangling by a lanyard from Brand's suit. 
ROTH It's not your light they're responding to. 
It's this-- Roth takes the depth meter and waves it over the ice. 
Suddenly, the black flecks begin to shine. 
BRAND X-rays. 
They feed on them and emit visible light. 
They've found a way to survive here. 
Roth looks at the shimmering light of the tiny life-forms trapped in the ice, mesmerized. 
Case hammers down with his arm, gouging a deep hole in the ice below. 
Suddenly, GAS sprays back up at him. 
He's found the gas pocket beneath them. 
Too late. 
Roth's rad meter begins BEEPING frantically. 
EXT. ICE PLANET -- ALIEN DAWN Overhead, a tiny ball is orbiting into view from the dark side of the black hole -- the NEUTRON STAR. Its humble size belies its power. 
As its rays hit the ice, the ice CRACKLES with energy. 
INT. ICE MINE SHAFT -- ALIEN DAWN Brand steps back from the ice in awe as it begins to glow. 
The microbes are absorbing the x-rays and emitting light. 
Within seconds, they are bathed in an incredible glow. 
Even Cooper stops, awed by the beauty of the display. 
Only Case is unmoved, continuing to SMASH at the ice with the broken end of his wrist. 78. 
BRAND (looks at rad meter) They're absorbing most of the x-rays. 
ROTH Not enough, unfortunately. 
Suddenly, a CRACK as Case punches into the ice. 
Cooper looks down -- a great fissure has opened in the ice beneath them. 
COOPER Case, wait-- Case PUNCHES again. 
Suddenly, with a great BANG, the ice floor disintegrates beneath them. 
They fall into the darkness. 
INT. CAVERN -- ALIEN DAWN Cooper falls. 
For a moment, the only light he can see is from Case, falling calmly a few yards beneath him. 
As they fall, the light from the microbes trapped in the ice above sweeps across the inside of the cavern, illuminating the floor of the massive cavern thousands of feet down. 
The rock formations they saw on the surface are actually the tip of a mountain range extending into the distance, disappearing into the ice above as if it were cloud cover. 
The base of the mountains is covered in a thick jungle-like foliage that runs into a perfectly-still inland sea. 
On the far side of the sea, another mountain range stretches into the distance, supporting the thick ice and rock cavern roof. 
Cooper only has a few seconds to take this in -- he is falling towards the huge inland sea below. 
Seconds before impact, a tiny warning light flickers on inside his helmet: IMPACT DETECTED. Suddenly, a small drag chute EXPLODES from a panel on the back of suit, slowing his fall. 
Airbags EXPLODE on his legs and torso to cushion the impact. 
Cooper SMASHES into the water. 
BLACKNESS. EXT. UNDERWATER -- DAY Cooper comes to underwater, as liquid is flowing into his suit from his shattered helmet. 79. 
Bubbles pour out from his suit and Cooper GASPS as his helmet fills with water and he begins to sink. 
As he sinks, Cooper pulls off his helmet, then tears off pieces of his suit. 
He forces himself through the neck of the suit and then swims upward. 
He is about to surface when he remembers where he is. 
He hesitates, just beneath the surface, lungs tightening as he runs out of oxygen. 
EXT. SEA, ICE PLANET -- DAY Cooper breaks the surface, COUGHS out water, and takes a panicked breath. 
He waits. 
Nothing happens. 
He opens his mouth again and breathes in almost pure oxygen. 
He can breathe. 
Treading water, he looks around. 
Spots lights in the water below nearby -- Brand, in her suit, is sinking. 
He dives down and struggles to haul her up by the suit. 
Cooper breaks the surface, looks at Brand. 
Her mask is also broken. 
COOPER Breathe. 
Trust me. 
She refuses at first. 
Water is bubbling into her suit through the open mask. 
Finally, she takes a deep breath. 
COOPER (CONT'D) Your suit is filling with water. 
I'm not going to be able to hold it much longer. 
I'm going to let go. 
Brand's eyes widen. 
BRAND What do you mean, you're going to let go? 
COOPER Take a deep breath. 
Brand takes a deep breath and Cooper lets go of her. 
EXT. UNDERWATER -- DAY Brand sinks. 
Cooper swims down, following her, ripping away at her suit. 
The tear-away seals on her suit are stuck fast, damaged in the fall. 80. 
Cooper finally breaks them off. 
Brand pulls herself out, free, and they swim for the surface. 
EXT. SHORE, ICE PLANET -- DAY Cooper drags himself out of the water and onto the beach. 
He turns back to offer Brand a hand. 
She waves him off. 
BRAND I don't need your help. 
COOPER I thought we were supposed to be a collective organism. 
She gives up and lets him help her out of the water. 
They sit together, soaking wet, trying to catch their breath. 
BRAND Thank you. 
COOPER Don't mention it. 
Cooper feels the rocks beneath him, which are translucent, like glass, and polished to an impossible shine. 
He looks up to see Case dragging Roth and Doyle, still in their suits, out of the water. 
EXT. SHORE, ICE PLANET -- DAY Doyle and Roth have stripped down from their suits and are breathing in the pure oxygen atmosphere. 
Case and Cooper are pulling modular pieces from their equipment packs to form a small shelter. 
Brand is taking readings with her instruments. 
BRAND Oxygen atmosphere. 
Pure water. 
Temperate climate. (TO COOPER) You still think this is a coincidence? 
Cooper looks at the tree line, less convinced. 
COOPER Looks like we can climb up the mountains back to the ice. 
We're down to three suits. 
We'll have to send someone ahead to get a fourth. 81. 
BRAND I won't need one. 
DOYLE Why not? 
BRAND Because I'm not going anywhere. 
This is our new home. 
Brand picks up some of her instruments and a sample case and hikes into the jungle. 
EXT. SHORE, ICE PLANET -- DAY Cooper finishes constructing the modest shelter. 
They load the suits and the rest of their gear inside. 
COOPER Any sign of Brand? 
ROTH She's still taking samples. 
If you find her, tell her to head back. 
Night should be falling soon. 
COOPER What happens then? 
ROTH Your guess is as good as mine. 
Cooper hikes into the jungle to look for Brand. 
EXT. JUNGLE, ICE PLANET -- DAY Cooper finds Brand taking samples from the tree-like life- forms, which are wildly different from their counterparts back on Earth, piled in torturous coils, as if frozen in a struggle to punch through the canopy to reach the light above. 
BRAND This is incredible. 
The organisms trapped in the ice above absorb x- rays and emit light. 
In return, these plants absorb the light and emit oxygen, which feeds the animals trapped in the ice. 
Brand cuts off a sample and drops it into the case. 
The transparent wall of the case magnifies the structure onto the glass automatically. 
She compares it with the flecks she collected in the ice above, fascinated. 82. 
BRAND (CONT'D) Look at this. 
I think they're the same organism at a different stage of the life cycle. (shows him the sample) It's fractal. 
No individual cells -- the structure repeats all the way down. 
Cooper looks at the sample, then continues scanning the jungle around them, nervous. 
COOPER Any sign of big life-forms? 
BRAND The soil's been disturbed. 
So something's been moving. 
But I haven't seen anything. (notices his look) Cooper... are you nervous? 
Cooper stops scanning the trees, embarrassed. 
COOPER I just think we should get back to the shelter before night falls. 
Overhead, the light from the ice above begins to fade -- the neutron star must have orbited out of view. 
Night is falling. 
BRAND (LAUGHING) Relax. 
If there are any large organisms here, even predatory ones, they're not going to attack us -- they have no idea what we are. 
COOPER You don't know that. 
You just have blind faith this place is going to be some kind of Eden. 
Brand stops. 
He's struck a nerve. 
BRAND (truly pissed off) Faith has nothing to do with it. 
You know what you are, Cooper? 
You're just another in a long line of people saying 'no.' That this isn't going to work. 
And frankly, I don't have to convince you. 83. 
COOPER What's that supposed to mean? 
BRAND You're on this mission because you're another pair of hands. 
You want the truth? 
I told Case we should bring another robot over you. 
At least then I could just reprogram you to- She stops. 
Something has caught her attention. 
COOPER What? 
BRAND Nothing. 
I just -- I could have sworn it just moved. 
She walks to the thick, knotted trunk of a tree. 
Puts a hand on it. 
Overhead, the ice flickers out and the darkness begins to descend, more rapidly than on Earth. 
Suddenly, the tree SHUDDERS. Then, the bark begins to ooze over Brand's fingers. 
Brand snaps her hand away and steps back. 
Even for her, this is too much. 
She turns back to Cooper, who is looking at the jungle around them, spooked. 
COOPER You know how plants don't usually move? 
Is that a universal rule? 
BRAND No. There really aren't any rules. 
All around them, the life-forms begins to melt toward the ground, breaking down into different, smaller forms. 
BRAND (CONT'D) (trying to stay calm) Remember, we're the aliens. 
Cooper steps back as several pieces of the nearest tree drop onto the ground and begin scuttling toward him. 
BRAND (CONT'D) Hold very still. 
Don't make any sudden movements. 
Two of the pieces join together, stacking themselves up and staggering toward him. 84. 
A third piece climbs onto the first two, looking for a good place to hang on. 
After a moment it hunkers down on top, forming a crude head. 
Thirty eye-like structures blink open on the creature. 
The skin of the life-form begins to flicker with a dim light like the animals trapped in the ice above, bathing Cooper and Brand in a warm glow. 
The creature creeps closer to them, taking them in. 
Cooper tries his best to seem non-threatening. 
COOPER Hello there. 
The creature lurches toward him on three legs, then its head splits open and it BELLOWS. COOPER (CONT'D) OK. Now we run. 
Brand doesn't argue. 
They turn and sprint through the trees. 
EXT. JUNGLE -- NIGHT Cooper and Brand smash headlong through the jungle. 
At first, they're running from the rumbling, smashing melee behind them. 
But as they run, the entire jungle around them begins to break apart and move. 
After a moment, they're surrounded. 
The jungle is completely disassembling itself into a million different pieces, each one a different size and shape than the others. 
COOPER We have to reach the shelter. 
They head off, crashing through the melee. 
EXT. SHORE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT Case, Doyle and Roth are standing in front of the shelter finishing the day's work. 
Doyle turns around. 
The jungle is breaking apart and crawling down the beach towards them. 
DOYLE I think we've got a problem. 
Case and Roth look up to see the organisms picking up speed as they move towards them. 
Roth begins to step out towards them. 85. 
ROTH Fascinating. 
I think- Case grabs him by the arm and pushes him bodily into the shelter after Doyle. 
Case pushes the door closed. 
INT. SHELTER, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT They crouch inside the shelter as the organisms begin POUNDING at the walls, trying to force their way inside. 
It's going to be a long night. 
EXT. JUNGLE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT Ahead, Cooper can see the gleaming water of the inland sea, light still flickering in patches from the ice above it. 
COOPER This way. 
Brand begins to follow. 
BRAND No... wait. 
Too late. 
Cooper forces his way between two writhing creatures, steps through, and falls... 
EXT. WATERFALL -- NIGHT Cooper gasps as he surfaces from the ice-cold water. 
Brand floats past. 
The river appears to flow randomly down the slope, with good reason -- the forest rearranges itself every night. 
Ahead, the ground drops away again and the water rushes over it in a torrent. 
Cooper catches himself at the last minute, grabbing a thick tree branch with one hand and, a second later, Brand with the other as she slides past. 
COOPER I've got you. 
Suddenly, the branch in Cooper's hand illuminates and wrenches itself out of the rock -- it's a limb of a huge colony organism. 
It shakes Cooper loose and they fall again... 86. 
EXT. POOL -- NIGHT Brand surfaces first. 
She grabs Cooper and hauls him up and out of the water. 
She smiles down at him, a little smug. 
BRAND I've got you. 
Creatures begin splashing down into the pool behind them, as if imitating them. 
Cooper stumbles to his feet and Brand guides them backward into a small cave carved into the rock above the pool. 
INT. CAVE -- NIGHT Brand CRACKS a glow stick, basking the cave around them in a soft light. 
As they watch, horrified, the pool and the rocks in front of the cave fill up with creatures of all sizes, as they tumble down the hill in what appears to be a battle royal. 
For a moment, it looks like Brand and Cooper may go unnoticed. 
Then, a three-foot-tall creature with a dozen legs creeps its way toward the entrance to the cave. 
Another follows, and another, until the cave entrance is full. 
Cooper looks around the cave, frantic. 
He picks up a rock. 
Brand, scared but still thinking, takes the rock from his hand and drops it back to the ground. 
BRAND It's game theory. 
The best move is always to cooperate at first. 
COOPER By "cooperate" do you mean let it eat me? 
BRAND These organisms have no interest in us. 
They survive by photosynthesis. 
All they need is light. 
COOPER Then why are they killing each other? 
BRAND I don't know. (LOOKS AROUND) But we're outnumbered, Cooper. 
So unless you have a better idea, I suggest we make nice. 87. 
The creatures move toward them hesitantly, then faster. 
Cooper stands stock still as the creatures gather around him. 
Several of them join up into bigger animals to get a better look at him. 
One of them wraps itself around his chest and begins prodding at his shoulders, then his neck. 
COOPER (trying to be calm) What is it doing? 
BRAND It's a colony organism. 
It's trying to incorporate you into its structure. 
COOPER I don't want it to incorporate me. 
BRAND Don't open your mouth. 
COOPER WHY N- As he speaks, the creature on his chest extends four spindly, pointed feelers and reaches gently into his mouth. 
Cooper holds his breath as the organism taps against his teeth. 
Its skin has a roughened texture, as if incomplete, and it appears to be searching for the same texture on Cooper's skin, without much luck. 
Bored, the life-forms climb back down off of Cooper. 
The last two creatures link up in an imitation of Cooper's lower body and attempt to walk across the room like a human. 
After a moment, the creatures tumble to the ground and flail away. 
Cooper is still breathing hard as the cave empties and he and Brand are left alone again. 
Brand steps to the edge of the cave and watches, fascinated, as the creatures resume wrestling and battling each other. 
COOPER (CONT'D) They're killing each other. 
BRAND No. They don't bleed... they don't die... they're just competing... trying out different shapes, looking for the best one. 88. 
Cooper watches as a hideously-awkward-looking, five-legged beast stumbles past and tackles another animal. 
COOPER I'd say they have a long way to go. 
BRAND (AMAZED) They do this every night. 
As they watch, a two-foot-long creature with one huge claw scuttles along the ground, grabbing smaller opponents and smashing them apart, then sorting through the wreckage and adopting some of the writhing parts as its own. 
Something about the movement is endearing, the way it experiments with each piece -- less like a massacre and more like an over-caffeinated self-assembling erector set. 
Suddenly, a massive, lumbering creature SMASHES down in front of the claw beast. 
No match, the smaller creature turns to scuttle away. 
Too slow. 
The larger organism brings one club-like limb smashing down on top of it. 
After a moment, it lifts its claw -- the two animals have become one. 
The new organism lumbers away through the jungle, happily snapping its new claw at larger opponents. 
BRAND (CONT'D) The behavior changes as the animals get bigger and bigger. 
More sophisticated. 
More calculated. 
Two of the larger organisms square off, circling each other, lights pulsing up and down their bodies in a fierce display. 
COOPER But what are they competing for? 
BRAND I don't know. 
Brand shivers -- it's getting colder. 
INT. CAVE -- NIGHT Brand and Cooper huddle around a small chemical fire they've brought with them. 
Brand looks at the sample of the fractal wildlife in her case. 
It's moving around, splitting apart, reforming, trying to find a way out. 89. 
BRAND These creatures are billions of years older than we are. 
But they're relatively primitive. 
They haven't developed tools, culture, language. 
COOPER Why not? 
BRAND I don't know. 
No one knows how intelligent life began on Earth. 
But the surface of this planet has virtually no craters. 
No impacts. 
It's been sheltered by the local black holes. 
COOPER What difference would that make? 
BRAND Maybe not enough has gone wrong here. 
Maybe bad luck is the key to intelligent life. 
COOPER (QUIETLY) Murph's Law. 
BRAND Exactly. 
Maybe our interaction with them will push them over the top. 
Maybe that's part of the plan. 
COOPER (shakes his head) The plan. 
BRAND Why is it so hard for you to accept that someone might be trying to help us? 
Cooper is silent for a moment. 
His mood darkens. 
COOPER I was in Denver during the first year of the famine. 
I was just a kid. 
We kept waiting for someone to come help us. 
People starved to death sitting on the ground, waiting for someone to come. (MORE) 90. 
COOPER (CONT'D) (looks at her) I only made it because I realized that nobody was coming to save us. 
We were on our own. 
Cooper looks away. 
The memories are never that far away. 
COOPER (CONT'D) Honestly? 
After the things I saw... you want to know why I don't believe that someone would be trying to help us? 
Because I'm not sure we're worth saving. 
They sit in silence for a while. 
EXT. CAVE -- NIGHT Cooper sleeps. 
After a moment, Brand steps back out into the darkness. 
EXT. PLAIN -- DAWN Brand exhales great streams of frosted breath -- the temperature is well below freezing. 
The first flickers of light are visible in the ice above. 
The creatures are huge now, forty or fifty feet tall, battling each other more and more slowly. 
As Brand watches, the largest of them beats down his rivals, climbing to the top of the heap. 
Just as the beast reaches the top, it freezes, as if stuck. 
Above, the ice begins to shine brighter and brighter. 
Suddenly, the beast on top breaks apart, unfurling into planes to catch the light. 
This is what the contest has been about -- a better place in the sun. 
Brand takes it in. 
EXT. JUNGLE -- DAY Cooper and Brand pick their way their way through the foliage, which is now perfectly still, absorbing the light. 
Cooper looks at the plants, wary. 
Brand sees his trepidation and laughs at him. 
BRAND They're not going to move now, Cooper. 
They need to spread themselves as thin as they can to absorb the light. 91. 
Cooper leads the way, pushing through the trees. 
Suddenly he stops again. 
Brand, annoyed, pushes through the foliage to join him. 
BRAND (CONT'D) Cooper, honestly, you're a bit of a- She stops. 
Cooper is standing at a sheer cliff. 
Spread out on the plain below is a massive, fortified base. 
INT. CHINESE FORTIFIED COLONY -- DAY Massive blast doors, long since smashed in, open onto a building that has been overrun by the local fractal wildlife. 
Case steps inside first, his worklights flickering on. 
Cooper and the others follow him in. 
INT. MESS HALL, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY The room is barely recognizable -- the fractal life has covered the tables and chairs. 
Water pools on the floor and light streams in from a massive hole the fractal animals have punched in the ceiling. 
DOYLE Looks like the Chinese picked a fight with the locals. 
COOPER Looks like they lost. 
They continue through the ruins. 
INT. BARRACKS, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY The deeper they go, the less fractal wildlife they find. 
The barracks are pristine -- hundreds of perfectly made beds, waiting for colonists who never came, like one of the bunkers the federal government used to keep in case of nuclear winter. 
DOYLE Look at the size of this place. 
They built it for thousands of people. 
But no one came. 
Brand looks around, determined. 
BRAND They will. 
We can salvage it. 
This place will save us years. 92. 
COOPER But why didn't they come? 
BRAND (SHRUGS) The Chinese government collapsed, same as ours. 
The people who knew about this mission probably died years ago. 
We had the same problems. 
Roth finds a sign he likes the look of -- it points to the science levels. 
INT. LABORATORY, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY A massive door GRINDS open and the team steps into a massive complex of underground laboratories. 
INT. DAMAGED LAB, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY Cooper and the others carefully make their way through a lab that has been completely emptied -- no desks, no chairs, nothing. 
The only thing that remains is a solid ball of matter in the center of the room. 
BRAND What happened here? 
Roth stares at the ball, intrigued. 
ROTH They were testing something. 
Cooper looks at the walls, which are bowed inwards. 
COOPER Testing what? 
Roth is looking at the ball, which appears to have been built from layers of different material. 
The outermost layer is flattened steel. 
COOPER (CONT'D) (LOOKING CLOSER) Is that a chair? 
Roth looks. 
The outermost layer of the ball indeed looks like a steel chair, flattened with incredible force onto surface of the ball. 
Brand opens the door to the next lab. 93. 
INT. LABORATORY, CHINESE COLONY -- NIGHT The lab is empty, except for a large metal sphere on a pedestal in the center of the room. 
A black box is set into a cavity in the sphere, wired to a control panel. 
Cooper looks at the walls of the room, which have been bowed inwards, as if some great force had been pulling from the center of the room. 
COOPER Everything in here is bolted down. (looks at sphere) What do you think this thing does? 
ROTH (EXCITED) Let's find out. 
Roth finds a control panel. 
Wipes off an inch of dust and begins tinkering with the controls. 
COOPER I wouldn't turn it on until we can figure out what it does, Roth. 
Roth continues to look over the controls, oblivious. 
BRAND (O.S.) Cooper. 
Come look at this. 
Brand calls out from the hallway. 
INT. STAIRWELL, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY Cooper follows Brand's voice down the stairs to a sub-basement beneath the lab level. 
INT. OBSERVATORY, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY Cooper steps into a huge space filled with a near perfect holographic representation of the local system. 
Cooper joins Brand and Doyle in the map, looking at the incredibly detailed models of each star. 
Case is standing at a terminal, hacking into the camp's records. 
CASE I've found the Chinese mission logs. 
They're encrypted. 
Cooper walks over. 
Looks over the terminal. 94. 
COOPER Old military-grade encryption. 
It's not very robust. (looks at Case) No offense. 
Hang on. 
Cooper punches a few keys into the terminal. 
Opens up the terminal. 
Scans the motherboard. 
Takes Case's rifle and SMASHES one of the chips on the board. 
The terminal comes to life. 
Cooper hands Case his rifle. 
COOPER (CONT'D) That should open up most of it. 
Case is silent for a beat, parsing the information. 
CASE They got here twenty years ago. 
The human crew was killed by radiation the first day. 
But the robots survived. 
They built the colony and radioed home. 
But they didn't receive a response. 
COOPER No one was listening. 
CASE (SCANS DOCUMENT) After a few years they discovered a problem. 
DOYLE What problem? 
CASE It doesn't say. 
Their science team took the ship to continue exploring the system. 
It says they found some kind of... (TRANSLATING) ...The word literally means 'treasure.' Case skims through the rest of the logs, large portions of which have been redacted. 
CASE (CONT'D) The science team returned after five years with a new technology. 
They began the experiments upstairs, then they left again and never returned. 95. 
BRAND Where did they go? 
CASE I don't know. 
They've deleted their mission plan. 
There's nothing else. 
DOYLE I think I know what the problem is. 
Doyle is manipulating the time component of the map, slowing down the passage of time, reversing it, speeding it up. 
DOYLE (CONT'D) Look. 
Doyle speeds up the map until the ice planet is nearly a blur, speeding in its orbit around Pantagruel. 
DOYLE (CONT'D) There's a small black hole moving into the system. 
Too small for us to have seen in our survey. 
It's not going to hit the planet, but it's going to come close. 
A tiny black hole soars through the system. 
Although it misses the ice planet, it deflects its orbit by a tiny degree. 
After a dozen more orbits, the ice planet dips down close to Pantagruel's event horizon and is torn apart. 
Brand and the others watch as the sequence rewinds and repeats -- the planet is pieced back together again and ejected, then pulled back in and torn apart. 
Over and over. 
DOYLE (CONT'D) This place isn't paradise. 
It's doomed. 
Just like us. 
The crew stand, watching the sequence in stunned silence. 
COOPER How long does this place have? 
CASE A few years. 
A decade at most. 
Doyle turns to Brand. 
DOYLE So much for the plan. 
Cooper looks at Brand. 
She is in disbelief, staring as a lifetime's training and optimism are torn to pieces. 96. 
BRAND But I don't understand... why are we here? 
What are we here for? 
Cooper looks down. 
Brand's upset is turning to anger. 
BRAND (CONT'D) What the hell are we here for? 
I trained my whole life to reach this place. 
She looks at Cooper, questioning. 
COOPER (GENTLE) Maybe... maybe Roth's right... maybe we just don't understand it yet. 
She looks down. 
She knows he doesn't believe what he's saying. 
He's been right all along -- they're alone. 
For a tiny moment, all hope is lost. 
Suddenly, with a distant RUMBLE, the building begins SHAKING. COOPER (CONT'D) Case, what is that? 
CASE It's nighttime. 
The native life- forms are mobile again. 
The RUMBLE grows more intense, as if the entire building is being gently shaken. 
COOPER No. It's closer than that. (REALIZING) Roth. 
The RUMBLE grows. 
As Cooper watches, Case's rifle slides free of the desk. 
But instead of falling, it simply hangs in the air. 
Then he realizes the same thing is happening to them -- his boots no longer have traction with the ground. 
After a second everything in the room is floating an inch off of the ground. 
COOPER (CONT'D) Quick -- hold onto something. 
He reaches out to Brand but it's too late -- suddenly they're no longer floating, they're falling. 
They're falling up. 97. 
Cooper, Brand and the rest of them hit the ceiling. 
Cooper picks himself up and adjusts to his surroundings -- up is now down. 
He helps Brand up. 
DOYLE What the hell is happening? 
Case doesn't answer -- he's looking up at the control equipment for the holographic display, which is GROANING under a load it was never built to handle. 
Case grabs Cooper and Brand and pushes them towards the stairwell as the control panel TEARS free of the floor and CRASHES towards them. 
Cooper falls into the stairwell -- now they're being pulled up and sideways through the stairwell, like an Escher painting. 
Brand pushes Cooper out of the way as debris from the control panel orbits past them back up towards the lab. 
They try to hang on but the force is becoming irresistible, dragging them along the wall of the stairwell and back towards the lab upstairs. 
Brand wedges herself against the railing as objects and debris are SMASHING against the door to the lab. 
Doyle is trying to hang onto the handrail but his grip slips and he CRIES OUT as he falls towards the door to the lab, SMASHING it open. 
Doyle disappears up and into the lab. 
Cooper slips trying to help Doyle. 
Brand reaches out for him... 
Too late. 
Cooper is pulled through the open door. 
INT. INTACT LAB, CHINESE COLONY -- NIGHT Cooper is pulled through the door and past the control panel. 
He reaches out and grabs the underside of the panel. 
He dangles, the panel cutting into the meat of his hand, trying to get his bearings: Roth, Doyle, and everything that hasn't been bolted down is either pressed against the sphere in the center of the room or is orbiting around it. 
Roth, who is laughing, jubilant, shouts up to him: ROTH The control panel is beneath you. 
See if you can turn it off. 98. 
Cooper slips as he tries to reach the controls. 
Finally he finds the controls for the machine. 
COOPER (YELLS UP) I found it. 
Hold onto something. 
Roth and Doyle crawl up the side of the mass and hold onto the support wires. 
Cooper hits a key on the monitor. 
Suddenly, the room inverts again, reverting to a normal gravitational field. 
Cooper floats for a second, then topples back to the ground, along with everything else. 
Brand stumbles in to find Cooper sprawled on the floor as Roth and Doyle hang onto the sphere for dear life. 
INT. INTACT LAB, CHINESE COLONY -- NIGHT Roth, back on terra firma, is looking at the tiny black box he's pried from the center of the sphere. 
Cooper is looking over his shoulder. 
COOPER They found a way to make gravity. 
ROTH Not make it. 
Adjust it. 
Dial it up, or down. 
I think they were experimenting with it -- firing these into the black hole to try to save this planet. 
DOYLE All that from one tiny box. 
Roth has hooked the box up to a terminal and it scrolling through the incredibly sophisticated machine code, trying to parse how it works. 
Cooper looks on. 
ROTH (AMAZED) It barely uses any power. 
I'm only beginning to understand what it does but I think it sends a signal out into the bulk. 
It must tap into the same technologies that were used to create the wormholes in the first place. 
COOPER What does that mean? 99. 
ROTH It means whoever built the wormhole probably doesn't exist inside our universe. 
Cooper looks at the tiny box. 
COOPER But how did the Chinese develop the technology? 
This would take decades, maybe hundreds of years, to create. 
CASE Wherever they went, they found something that allowed them to build it. 
Brand looks at the box. 
ROTH They came back here and tried to use these devices to save this planet. 
But they didn't work. 
Nothing would be strong enough to weaken a black hole. 
BRAND Maybe we could work with it. 
Try to improve it. 
ROTH No. You're missing the bigger picture. 
The robots had strict mission parameters. 
They were told to build a colony and report back. 
They tried to. 
But they failed. 
Like us they were fixated on this place. 
Cooper looks at Brand. 
ROTH (CONT'D) They didn't realize they had already found something that would save us all. (holds up the box) This. 
This is the prize. 
He holds up the box. 
ROTH (CONT'D) Don't you see? 
Earth's gravity is like a prison. 
But this is like a master key. (MORE) 100. 
ROTH (CONT'D) If we could build more of these, we could turn down the earth's gravitational field enough to save millions of people. 
We wouldn't have to pick a handful of people to survive. 
With this we can save everyone. 
BRAND And go where? 
ROTH Wherever we want. 
We don't belong in any one place. 
Can't you see that now? 
Not Earth. 
Not this place. 
Nowhere. 
If the human race is going to survive, we need to keep moving. 
Split up. 
Spread out. 
Fly. 
With this, we can. 
Case looks at the box. 
Makes a decision. 
CASE In the morning we're taking this and going home. 
Doyle, Roth and Case set about making preparations to leave -- gathering space suits, equipment. 
In the bustle, Cooper finds Brand sitting alone, staring at the sample of fractal life. 
COOPER I know this isn't exactly what you trained for. 
But I think Roth might be right. 
BRAND That doesn't help this planet. 
This creature is doomed. 
Unlike us it doesn't have anywhere to go. 
The fractal organism almost seems to be looking at her, trying to comprehend. 
But it quickly loses interest and goes back to breaking itself into pieces and reforming into different shapes, trying to escape. 
Brand sets it back down. 
CUT TO: INT. BARRACKS, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY Morning. 
Cooper and the others prepare to head out. 
They are laden down with gear -- space suits for the return trip to the lander once they reach the surface. 101. 
Roth carries the gravitational prototype. 
EXT. ENTRANCE, CHINESE FORTIFIED COLONY -- DAY They make their way through the ruined entrance. 
CASE We need to hurry. 
We only have a few hours to reach the ice before nightfall. 
Cooper stops. 
He puts a hand on Brand's shoulder. 
He points to the tree line. 
Something is moving. 
COOPER Don't make any sudden movements. 
They can't hurt us if we're unarmed. 
BRAND Who? 
Suddenly, three ROBOT MARINES step out of the jungle, weapons raised. 
They are wearing ghillie suits, pieced together from dried dead pieces of the local foliage. 
Under their camouflage, they looks identical to Case. 
With one key difference -- faded red and gold insignias. 
Case steps protectively in front of his team. 
The CHINESE OFFICER steps forward, rifle levelled. 
CHINESE OFFICER Ni Hao. 
My name is Technical Sergeant Liu, 177th reconnaissance Marines, Army of the People's Republic. 
Welcome to New China. (POLITE) Please put down your weapon. 
Sergeant Liu speaks in the same even tones as Case -- they were probably built in the same factory before the war. 
Case keeps his rifle raised. 
CASE This is a scientific expedition, not a military one. 
We are making our way back to our ship. 
LIU I'm afraid I cannot let you do that. 
We will provide food and shelter and await further instructions. (MORE) 102. 
LIU (CONT'D) We are sorry if this causes you any inconvenience. 
The sergeant is polite, but firm. 
BRAND This planet is being pulled into the black hole. 
We all need to leave. 
LIU We will await further orders. 
COOPER Further orders aren't coming. 
Your government is gone. 
It ran out of money, same as ours. 
You're on your own. 
LIU We can offer you food and shelter as long as you require. 
The facilities here are quite comfortable. 
Liu's tone remains polite, but there's no hope of changing his mind. 
Cooper takes a sidelong glance at Brand. 
COOPER (LOW) They're never going to let us go. 
BRAND (TO LIU) Your mission is a humanitarian one, wasn't it? 
You were sent to start a colony. 
Like us. 
LIU Our mission was to prepare for the evacuation. 
This site was deemed unacceptable. 
BRAND This device that you have built -- this could save millions of people. 
We need to get it back home. 
Brand points to the device Roth is holding. 
The Chinese robots seem particularly unhappy with this development. 
LIU These technologies are the property of the People's Republic. (MORE) 103. 
LIU (CONT'D) We have been ordered to prevent anyone from taking them. 
We have been ordered to prevent anyone from following. 
ROTH Following? 
Following where? 
Liu pauses. 
LIU We will await further orders. 
ROTH Your name means six. 
Where did the others go? 
One through five? 
Is that who were not supposed to follow. 
Case turns to look at Cooper. 
CASE (LOW) Take the others up to the lander. 
Keep going. 
No matter what happens, don't come back for me. 
Cooper nods. 
Case moves. 
Fast. 
He FIRES one shot at the nearest robot, disabling it, then hurls himself at the remaining two, tackling them both over the edge of the ravine. 
Cooper watches them disappear into the void below. 
Grabs Brand and the others. 
COOPER Come on. 
Cooper picks up the rifle from the destroyed marine and begins hiking up the mountain. 
EXT. MOUNTAIN PEAK -- DAY The crew hike towards the ice above. 
Below they hear a metallic BOOM as something heavy hits something else -- Case is still fighting. 
They keep moving. 
EXT. UPPER MOUNTAIN PEAK -- TWILIGHT They are high above the Marine camp, only fifty feet or so below the massive ice roof of the cavern. 
The Chinese have blasted a tunnel into the ice leading back up to the camp above. 104. 
This high, the air is bitterly cold. 
Cooper and the others are hunkered down, trying to keep warm, waiting for night to fall so that they can climb back up to the lander without being cooked by the neutron star. 
Finally, above them, the light begins to flicker out. 
The crew begin pulling on their space suits. 
Brand checks on the fractal wildlife in the sample case -- she is bringing it with them. 
Cooper catches her eye. 
BRAND We can't leave them all to die. 
She hefts the case and they begin climbing up into the ice. 
EXT. SURFACE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT Brand leads the way, the lights from her suit cutting into the drifts of snow as they make their way slowly back to the lander. 
As they reach the lander Cooper spots lights emerging from the ship. 
He raises Case's weapon. 
One of Liu's marines steps around from the back of the lander. 
Cooper FIRES. The marine collapses. 
Cooper and the others race to the lander. 
BRAND Was that the last of them? 
DOYLE We're not going to stick around to count them. 
Let's get out of here. 
COOPER We're too late. 
Cooper points to a damaged section of the ship's hull -- the marine has torn open a section, revealing damaged hardware. 
COOPER (CONT'D) The main thruster fuel supply. 
We're not going anywhere. 
Cooper looks down. 
They're stuck here. 
DOYLE What about the escape rocket at the Chinese base camp? 
One of us could fit into it. 105. 
BRAND It doesn't matter how many of us make it. 
We have to get this back to earth. 
Roth looks at the moons orbiting overhead. 
ROTH Can the secondary thrusters still fire on the lander? 
Doyle looks over the craft. 
DOYLE Sure. 
But we don't have nearly enough power for lift off. 
Roth holds up the small gravity black box. 
ROTH (SMILES) Yes we do. 
Roth sets off running towards the Chinese base camp. 
EXT. CHINESE BASE CAMP, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT Cooper drags the pieces of the escape rocket out from the shelter. 
Assembly is semiautomatic -- Cooper lifts the pieces up and they snap together, forming a crude two-stage rocket designed more for a robot than a man. 
When it's complete Roth wedges himself inside, clutching the black box -- he barely fits. 
ROTH I can reach one of the moons in low orbit and turn up its gravity. 
As it passes overhead it should be able to slingshot the lander away from the planet's surface. (LOOKS AROUND) Along with everything else. 
COOPER But we need to take the box back to earth. 
ROTH You don't need this -- only the idea. 
The knowledge of how to build it. 
Cooper remembers something. 
Heads back into the shelter. 106. 
INT. CHINESE BASE CAMP, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT Roth follows Cooper into the lab. 
Cooper opens the storage crate. 
Picks one of the probes at random. 
Sets it down on the bench next to Roth. 
Cooper begins rigging up a connection between the two. 
COOPER I'm going to image the operating code and the architecture onto the probe's hard drive. 
It'll be garbled, but it should give you and me enough to rebuild it when we get back. 
Cooper looks at the probe filling up with data. 
ROTH Not me. 
But you'll make it work. 
The transfer is complete. 
Roth hands Cooper the probe, and takes the black box himself. 
ROTH (CONT'D) This is a one-way trip for me. 
Before Cooper can respond, Roth heads for the door. 
EXT. CHINESE BASE CAMP, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT Roth squeezes himself into the rocket, hugging the black box to his chest. 
Cooper and Brand help him. 
BRAND This isn't right, Roth. 
We can find a way for all of us to leave. 
ROTH This is the only way. 
Keep the lander upright and fire the secondary boosters when the moon passes overhead. 
COOPER Let me take it. 
ROTH No. You need to make it home. 
You're going to need to build more of these. 
Brand looks at him, heartbroken. 
Roth smiles. 107. 
ROTH (CONT'D) I understand the plan, now. 
Whatever happens, you have to keep exploring. 
Keep learning. 
One good idea isn't enough. 
You'll need more and more of them just to survive. 
Do you understand? 
BRAND (NODS) Thank you. 
ROTH Go. Brand turns to follow Cooper back. 
Behind her, Roth's rocket LAUNCHES on an explosive cloud. 
In seconds it's high overhead. 
EXT. LANDER -- NIGHT Cooper checks over the hull, which is intact. 
Doyle is inside looking over the controls. 
He steps back outside. 
DOYLE Control systems inside are online. (LOOKS UP) I've lost sight of the rocket. 
Do you think he made it? 
COOPER We're going to find out soon enough. 
Brand is looking off into the distance. 
BRAND Someone's coming. 
Cooper looks up. 
A robotlike figure is limping through the snowstorm towards them. 
Cooper raises the rifle. 
Finally he makes out the insignia -- it's Case. 
Cooper and Doyle run out towards him. 
They reach Case as he collapses in the snow. 
He's badly injured -- one leg torn off at the knee, one arm mangled. 
Doyle and Cooper drag the crippled robot back into the ship. 
INT. LANDER -- NIGHT They drag Case into the lander. 
Doyle checks over the ship's controls. 108. 
DOYLE Close the door. 
Cooper moves to the door. 
Something's wrong. 
COOPER Where's Brand? 
She's nowhere to be seen. 
Cooper looks out onto the ice. 
Brand is heading back out into the snow. 
COOPER (CONT'D) Dammit. 
If I don't make it back, just keep going. (points to probe) Get that thing home. 
Cooper steps to the door. 
EXT. SPACE ABOVE ICE PLANET The rocket tucks in close behind one of the moons orbiting the ice planet. 
The rocket fires to maneuver closer and closer to the moon's surface -- the tiny moon doesn't provide enough gravity to attract it. 
When the rocket is close enough, Roth detonates the explosive bolts holding him inside and leaps for the moon's surface. 
He scrambles to grab hold of the craggy surface. 
Behind him, the rocket smashes apart against the surface. 
Roth finally gets a good hold. 
He looks down. 
Below him, the view is incredible -- the ice planet curving into the distance, Gargantua rising over its horizon. 
Roth looks at the black box in his hands. 
EXT. SURFACE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT Brand is a hundred yards from the lander by the time Cooper catches up with her. 
She is digging in the snow. 
He takes her arm but she won't go. 
She finally finds what she's looking for -- the sample case. 
The tiny fractal life-form is huddled at the bottom. 
Cooper shakes his head and turns back to the lander. 109. 
EXT. MOON, SPACE OVER ICE PLANET Roth is watching the ice planet pass by beneath him. 
He finally sees the distant peaks of the mountain range as it punctures the ice near the Chinese camp. 
For a moment he enjoys the view -- the distant hulk of Gargantua rising over the horizon of the shining ice planet. 
He takes a final breath and activates the black box. 
Instantly, the moon's gravity is magnified a hundred million times over. 
Roth is instantly crushed as the moon collapses around him into a tiny sphere. 
EXT. SURFACE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT Cooper and Brand are only thirty yards or so from the lander. 
Suddenly, the ground beneath them begins to RUMBLE. Cooper turns back. 
A mile back the ground begins to tear apart, heaving massive chunks of ice and rock into the sky. 
Roth's moon is racing overhead, TEARING up a massive strip of the surface's planet as it nears them. 
Cooper and Brand run. 
EXT. MOON, SPACE OVER ICE PLANET The energy being unleashed by the tiny box is incredible -- millions of times more powerful than an atomic bomb. 
The spray of debris is forming a rooster tail behind the moon, rocketing up from the planet's surface. 
EXT. LANDER, SURFACE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT Cooper has almost made it back to the lander. 
Behind him, Brand stumbles. 
He turns back. 
Brand is pulling herself up. 
Behind her, the THUNDEROUS EXPLOSIONS as a strip of the planet's surface is hurled into space have almost reached them. 
Cooper looks at the ship. 
He'll never make it if he waits for Brand. 
He turns back to find her. 
He reaches Brand just as the moon's gravity hits them -- they're hurtled off into space. 
He grabs her hand. 
Seconds later, everything -- the entire ice sheet, the sea and rocks deep below -- is hurled up after them. 110. 
Brand and Cooper embrace as they rocket up through the thin atmosphere. 
Brand looks at him. 
BRAND (RADIO) You caught me. 
Now what? 
Cooper looks around. 
They planet's surface is breaking into pieces around them. 
COOPER (RADIO) I don't know. (RADIO) I figured if you were floating out into space, you'd want some company. 
He holds onto her as they fall up and out of the last of the planet's thin atmosphere and the blackness embraces them. 
BRAND Between you and utter solitude, Cooper, frankly, I'm not sure. 
They reach the apex of their climb and the gravity of the planet begins to win out. 
For a moment they float. 
COOPER Guess you were right -- too much gravity, or not enough. 
He smiles, forgetting their predicament for a moment. 
They stare into each other's eyes. 
Then they begin, very gently, to fall back towards the ice planet. 
Suddenly, the lander maneuvers beneath them. 
The airlock opens to catch them -- Doyle is at the helm. 
Brand and Cooper pull themselves aboard. 
INT. LANDER Cooper closes the door and Doyle rotates the lander outwards. 
Doyle FIRES the engines and the lander continues ascending into space as the debris around them begins crashing back down towards the ice planet. 
Cooper looks out the window: 111. 
The moon continues tearing up a massive canyon in the planet's surface as it circles out of view. 
COOPER Roth. 
BRAND He's gone. 
Ahead, a shadow looms in the darkness: the Endurance. 
INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE Brand, Cooper, and Doyle pull themselves out of the airlock and scramble to take control of the ship. 
Below them, the surface of the ice planet illuminates as the neutron star's x-rays begin to reach it from the far side of Pantagruel. 
Doyle finally gets the ship straightened out. 
Its sole remaining engine FIRES, rocketing the ship back towards the dark side of the planet, out of view of the neutron star, and back towards the original wormhole. 
DOYLE I'm setting a course for the wormhole. 
They're going to make it. 
Cooper and Brand make eye contact -- Brand gives him a tiny awkward smile. 
He returns it, then descends below. 
INT. OUTER HULL, ENDURANCE Cooper props Case up against the workbench. 
He pulls down replacement arms and legs from storage bins. 
Unwraps them from their vacuum sealed plastic and bolts them back onto Case's chassis. 
Cooper finishes attaching the arm. 
Case rotates it, checking the function. 
COOPER How is that working? 
CASE Very well, thank you. 
COOPER Good. 
We've already set the course, skipper. 
We're going home. 
Cooper hauls himself back up into the observation level. 112. 
INT. OBSERVATION LEVEL Doyle is setting the controls. 
The ALARMS on the controls have finally abated -- they're out of the danger zone. 
BRAND We're safe now. 
Cooper heads to the communications equipment. 
COOPER Now I know why we weren't able to hit the relay. 
It's not interference -- the blue-shift from the black hole is more than we thought it would be. 
Cooper begins re-calibrating the equipment. 
BRAND (CONFLICTED) Cooper, wait-- The ship PINGS the relay on the far side of the wormhole. 
There is no response. 
COOPER Nothing. (THINKS) Wait. 
The ship cached one long garbled transmission when we first fell into the swirl. 
If we account for the blue shift then the computer might find something in there. 
Cooper brings up the last garbled transmission they received. 
The computer begins re-analyzing it, piece by piece. 
BRAND (QUIET) Listen to me -- the blueshift also means we've lost time. 
More time than we thought we would. 
Cooper looks up at her. 
COOPER How much? 
BRAND A lot... 
Cooper, maybe it's best if WE DON'T- The comms equipment TONES as it translates a packet. 
Then another. 113. 
Then a FLOOD of communications, one packet a day, hundreds and hundreds of packets: images, videos, audio messages from family and friends. 
Cooper watches, horrified, as the images play out across the screen. 
He is watching the lives of his family play out at light speed. 
Finally, the packets slow, then stop. 
Cooper looks at the results, in shock. 
COOPER Forty seven years. 
Doyle joins him, staring at the screen, stunned. 
DOYLE My kids... 
Cooper tries to PING the relay again. 
Nothing comes back. 
BRAND (GENTLE) The relay will have lost power years ago. 
That's why we couldn't contact it, even after we reached the planet. 
Cooper is still problem solving, thinking. 
COOPER We could bypass the relay. 
Send a conventional shortwave signal. 
BRAND Only a tiny portion of the signal would make it though the wormhole. 
Besides, no one will be listening anymore. 
The comms screen is dead. 
No movement. 
Nothing. 
Cooper looks at Brand, realizing something. 
COOPER You knew, didn't you? 
You and Case figured it out when we landed. 
Brand looks down. 
BRAND I thought... 
I couldn't be sure. 
COOPER Sure you could. 
You're brilliant. 
You know everything. 114. 
BRAND Cooper... we needed to keep going. 
I'm so sorry. 
Your children... 
COOPER They're not children any more... if they're even still alive. 
He turns away from her. 
BRAND Listen, the important thing is that we're going home, now. 
And we have something that can save everyone. 
It's more important than the people we left behind- Doyle cuts her off, filled with anger. 
DOYLE That's easy for you to say. 
You didn't leave anyone behind. 
Cooper looks at Brand, his anger softened by sadness. 
COOPER Yes she did. 
Brand looks at him, grateful for this small kindness. 
COOPER (CONT'D) That's why you were upset -- your father. 
She looks down, filled with sadness. 
BRAND He's gone. 
But there are other people who still need our help. 
There's still time... 
The ship's controls TONE in ALARM. Brand and Cooper turn: Case is standing at the controls. 
BRAND (CONT'D) Case... what are you doing? 
Case finishes typing in a sequence on the command controls. 
Presses the "execute" button. 
The last nuclear engine begins to detach from the ship. 
BRAND (CONT'D) Wait... no... 115. 
The robot turns from them. 
Cooper notices that the control module snapped into the back of Case's chassis is wrong: It's red with a gold star. 
It's not Case at all. 
It's Liu. 
LIU I'm sorry. 
I have my orders. 
No one follows... 
Liu stares, satisfied, as the nuclear engine spins away from the ship and back down toward Pantagruel. 
Cooper SMASHES Liu from behind. 
The robot tumbles to the ground, the fight gone out of him. 
Cooper and Doyle roll the robot over and Cooper reaches for his control module. 
LIU (CONT'D) No one follows- Cooper rips the module out. 
The robot freezes. 
Brand is already at the controls, trying to regain control. 
The instruments TONE, alerting the crew to their position: The ship is spinning back down towards the black hole. 
BRAND No... 
We're being pulled back to Pantagruel. 
Cooper, frantically checks the controls, firing the remaining boosters. 
COOPER We can't let that happen. 
We'll lose more time... too much... 
The boosters are no match for the deadly pull of the black hole below them. 
On the ship's guidance, they watch, helpless, as the ship climbs back up the volcano rim towards the critical orbit. 
As on their first trip, the black hole grows to dominate the bottom of the sky, and the stars above them become streaks -- time is speeding for them as they are whirled down into the deep gravity well around the hole. 
As they watch, trapped, decades begin to play out in the system above them. 
They watch as the ice planet whirls around them, orbiting the black hole dozens of times. 116. 
COOPER (CONT'D) We're losing years. 
Finally, the ice planet plunges past them towards destruction. 
As it reaches it slows, until finally it reaches the event horizon, just as they saw in the projections. 
Nothing has prepared them for the reality: The ice planet is SMASHED apart with stunning violence. 
Brand looks at the sample of fractal life. 
Now they are united -- they are, in all likelihood, the sole survivors of their planet. 
Doyle points to the instruments. 
DOYLE The wormhole. 
Look -- it's being pulled into the black hole as well. 
They watch on the holographic model as the wormhole's orbit converges on the event horizon of the black hole. 
BRAND It's orbit mirrored the ice planet's. 
COOPER What will happen to it? 
BRAND It'll be destroyed, like everything else. 
Cooper struggles to pull himself over to the communications screen. 
Sets it to make a shortwave broadcast. 
Brand opens her mouth to point out that it's futile, then stops. 
COOPER (INTO RADIO) This is the crew of the Endurance. 
We... (gives up on FORMALITIES) Murph, I'm sorry. 
I'm sorry I didn't make it back, like I promised. 
He hangs up the radio. 
In silence, they watch as the wormhole -- their only way home -- vanishes beneath the event horizon. 
DOYLE How much time are we losing? 117. 
BRAND (HEARTBROKEN) Decades...hundreds of years. 
COOPER All of those people back home... none of them will make it. 
As Doyle watches the controls the ship continues to spiral towards the black hole. 
DOYLE This is it. 
We're going to be pulled in. 
Cooper looks at the controls, an idea forming. 
He pulls himself down. 
Hauls himself across the deck to pick up Liu's chip. 
He plugs it into a diagnostic tool. 
BRAND What are you doing? 
COOPER Case said the Chinese found something else. 
The location was scrubbed from their records. 
But I bet he knows it. 
Cooper fires up the chip. 
Begins sorting through the onboard memory. 
Doyle watches the instruments. 
DOYLE Hurry up. 
Cooper concentrates, poring over the numbers. 
Finally he begins feeding coordinates into the navigation computer. 
COOPER Here. 
Can we reach it? 
Brand looks at the map. 
The point appears on the far side of Gargantua. 
Brand studies the trajectory. 
BRAND We can use the thrusters to keep us on the critical orbit. 
Then slingshot us towards Gargantua. 
The thrusters STRAIN to push the ship back up towards the critical orbit. 118. 
Suddenly, the tidal gravity SLAMS them against the walls of the ship. 
Finally, the thrusters fire again -- a tiny push, but just enough to launch the ship clear of the black hole, like a rock out of a slingshot. 
The ship races toward the massive hole in the sky below them: GARGANTUA EXT. SPACE AROUND GARGANTUA The ship picks up more and more speed as it soars closer to the massive black hole's event horizon. 
INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE The sky closes to a tiny hole above them. 
Gargantua is swallowing their view. 
Cooper looks at the radar, which is choked with debris. 
DOYLE We only have a few minutes before we're swallowed into that thing. 
What are we even looking for? 
On the radar, a tiny empty spot appears. 
COOPER (points to screen) That? 
What is it? 
Brand looks. 
In one tiny region on the back side of the black hole, the debris simply seems to vanish. 
BRAND It's another wormhole. 
Doyle FIRES the thrusters again, pushing the ship towards the wormhole. 
EXT. SPACE AROUND GARGANTUA The Endurance spins, shifting paths slightly as it continues to race closer and closer to oblivion. 
INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE They study the controls. 
The projected path shifts, one degree at a time. 
Finally, it appears to put them on a path to hit the wormhole. 
Doyle shuts off the thrusters. 119. 
DOYLE We're not going to be able to slow down. 
Hold onto something. 
He locks up the controls. 
EXT. SPACE AROUND GARGANTUA -- MORNING The ship is tumbling through space, racing toward the second wormhole. 
It is massive, much larger than the first wormhole, and it's glowing with a light as bright as a star. 
INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE The crew brace themselves against the hull of the ship. 
Suddenly the ship slams onto the wormhole mouth and is pulled violently into the wormhole. 
WHITENESS. As the light fades, Cooper and the others come to. 
The light is rapidly dimming from pure white, fading to a deep red, then infrared, finally darkness. 
Cooper looks out. 
Checks the instruments. 
Looks out again. 
EXT. VACUUM Nothing. 
Blackness as far as the eye can see. 
No stars. 
No planets. 
Just inky darkness stretching on forever. 
INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE Brand joins Cooper on the deck. 
Together, they look out at the blackness that surrounds them. 
COOPER Where are we? 
BRAND I don't know. 
It's like we entered the wormhole and never left it. 
Brand checks the instruments. 
There is nothing for the ship to model. 
There is nowhere to go. 
They drift. 
INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE Days go by. 
They check the instruments. 
Still nothing. 
It's as if they have left the known universe altogether. 120. 
INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM, ENDURANCE Doyle sits down. 
After a moment, he turns on the screen and cues up a message. 
His children appear on-screen, giggling, pushing each other, trying to get a prime spot in front of the camera. 
Doyle cups his face in his hands and cries. 
INT. CREW QUARTERS, ENDURANCE Cooper above his bunk, stares out into the blackness. 
Brand watches him from the doorway. 
BRAND I'm sorry. 
I should have told you. 
I didn't have the right. (BEAT) But you should watch the recordings. 
You should know what happened to your kids. 
Cooper ignores her. 
INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM, ENDURANCE Brand watches her father talking to her on-screen. 
He is twenty years older than when she left him. 
BRAND'S FATHER I'm not going to make it much longer. 
The machines will continue to maintain the station as long as they can and the communications will run as long as the station here still has power. 
I'm sorry. 
I hope wherever you are, darling, you're safe. 
The screen cuts out. 
Brand watches the static play out. 
INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE Doyle sits at the table. 
He has found a flair gun in one of the ditch kits. 
It is sitting on the table in front of him. 
The message is clear. 
Brand sits down across from him. 
BRAND Our last trip past the black hole cost us another 100, maybe 200 years. 
Which means there's a good chance we're the only humans alive anywhere. 121. 
She stands up. 
BRAND (CONT'D) I think the last human beings should have a little more fight in them than that. 
Brand picks up the sample of fractal life and places it under a lamp on the counter. 
It freezes, absorbing the rays. 
Doyle looks at the gun. 
EXT. ENDURANCE, VACUUM Cooper, in a space suit, steps out of the airlock. 
He drifts out from the ship. 
Nothing. 
Behind him, the ship is a tiny speck in an ocean of darkness. 
INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM, ENDURANCE Cooper sits down. 
Turns on the screen. 
After a moment, the camera turns on. 
Tom, his eldest son, still 15 years old, turns on the camera. 
TOM Hi, Dad. 
Cooper pauses it. 
He can't take it. 
After a moment, he lets it run again. 
TOM (CONT'D) I met another girl, Dad. 
I really think this is the one. 
Tom holds up a picture of himself and a teenage GIRL. TOM (CONT'D) Murph stole Grandpa's car. 
He crashed it. 
He's OK, though. 
No broken bones. 
Cooper leans back. 
INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM, ENDURANCE Cooper is holed up, still watching, several days' growth of beard unshaved. 
He's been watching for days. 
On the screen, Tom is a grown man in his 20s. 122. 
TOM I've got a surprise for you, Dad. 
You're a grandpa. 
Tom holds up an infant wrapped tight in swaddling. 
The kid is BAWLING. TOM (CONT'D) Congratulations. 
Grandpa said he already earned the "great" bit so we just leave it at that. 
The screen cuts out. 
The next message begins. 
Tom is in his 30s. 
TOM (CONT'D) Hi, Dad. 
I'm sorry it's been awhile. 
He stops, emotional. 
TOM (CONT'D) Grandpa died last week. 
We buried him out in the back forty, next to Mom. (LOOKS DOWN) Where we'd have buried you, if you'd ever come back. 
He laughs, gallows humor. 
TOM (CONT'D) Murph was there for the funeral. 
It's been a few years since I've seen him. 
He's been down in the Gulf Coast. 
He's an engineer. 
I guess someone followed in your footsteps after all. 
Tom looks down. 
TOM (CONT'D) You're not listening to this. 
I know that. 
All of these messages are just out there, drifting in the darkness. 
He stops for a second. 
TOM (CONT'D) You're gone. 
You're never coming back. 
And I've known that for a long time. 
Lois says -- that's my wife, Dad -- she says I have to let you go. 
So I am. 123. 
He reaches up to turn off the camera. 
TOM (CONT'D) Wherever you are, I hope you're at peace. 
Goodbye, Dad. 
The image freezes, Tom's hand on the camera, then breaks apart into digital noise. 
Then nothing. 
Cooper looks at it for a second. 
Then rises to leave. 
Suddenly, the screen flickers to life again. 
A good-looking man in his late 30s turns on a camera. 
Cooper recognizes him instantly. 
It's Murph. 
Murph looks at the camera for a long beat, clearly unsure about this. 
MURPH Hello, Dad. 
You sonofabitch. 
He laughs, self-conscious. 
MURPH (CONT'D) It's your 60th birthday today. 
Thought I would celebrate with you a bit. (BEAT) I guess I understand why you left. 
The corn is dying now, too. 
Tom says there's less and less at harvest every year. 
He pauses. 
Lifts up his hand and scratches his stubble. 
Cooper pauses the message. 
He looks carefully at the screen: Murph is wearing his dad's watch. 
Cooper lets the message play. 
Tears are streaming down his face. 
MURPH (CONT'D) Rot's setting in. 
I guess you were right for clearing out while you had the chance. (reaches up to switch OFF CAMERA) Good luck, old man. 
I hope you made it. 
I really do. 
The video cuts out. 124. 
A message appears on the screen: "Final transmission." Relay powered down 05232087 Cooper turns off the screen. 
INT. CREW QUARTERS, ENDURANCE Cooper is seated, alone. 
Almost every compartment has been opened and emptied -- debris is swirling through the compartment. 
Brand walks in. 
They sit in silence for a moment. 
When Cooper speaks, it's clear his sadness has faded to a gallows humor. 
COOPER Not a single drink on the whole ship. 
What kind of mission is this? 
BRAND I think Doyle's been experimenting with the coolant from his spacesuit. 
They sit in silence for a moment. 
COOPER You really think we're the last humans alive anywhere? 
BRAND I don't know. 
Maybe. (looks him in the eye) Yes. 
COOPER So that's it, then? 
That's all? 
He looks down, saddened by his own words. 
BRAND (QUIET) It's happened a billion times over. 
Stars explode. 
The pieces drift in space. 
Gravity pulls them back together. 
They form new stars. 
Then planets. 
Then us. 
We die. 
It starts all over again. 
Cooper shakes his head. 
COOPER What about the plan? 
The grand scheme. 125. 
BRAND I thought you didn't believe in one. 
COOPER I didn't. 
But you were bringing me round. 
He laughs, his anger coming and going in waves. 
COOPER (CONT'D) What the hell was the point? 
What did it add up to? 
BRAND I don't know. 
Maybe it just adds up to this. 
COOPER This? 
You're saying the end result of ten billion years is the atoms from dead stars standing here disagreeing with each other. 
She smiles at him. 
Bittersweet. 
BRAND Maybe that's enough. 
He turns away from her. 
She takes his shoulder. 
She pulls him into a kiss. 
His surprise disappears and he pulls her to him, kissing her back. 
Their surroundings forgotten, they drift. 
She LAUGHS gently as they bump into a wall and he pushes off of it, sending them spinning back into the center of the cabin. 
She pulls his shirt off and it hangs in space. 
In moments, the cabin is filling with discarded clothes, different colors and shapes, like a ticker tape parade. 
In the center of the cabin, Brand and Cooper make love. 
INT. CREW QUARTERS, ENDURANCE -- LATER Cooper and Brand embrace, sleeping, drifting in the cabin. 
Suddenly, Doyle's voice calls out from the other cabin. 
DOYLE (O.S.) It's happening... it's happening again... 
Get up here... 
Cooper wakes, careful not to disturb Brand. 
He plucks his shirt from the floating laundry pile and pulls it on. 126. 
INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE Cooper hauls himself up into the upper cabin. 
Doyle is standing in the middle of the chamber. 
DOYLE They just appeared. 
A sphere of distortion, like the one they encountered in the first wormhole, is directly in front of Doyle, hovering at a point in the middle of the cabin. 
Doyle points a finger gently at the sphere, which grows in response. 
Brand pulls herself into the cabin. 
Several more points appear, as if they've been summoned by the first. 
Some of the points twist, some of them spin, and some of them are motionless. 
BRAND I think these are the creatures that built the wormhole. 
One of them begins to move closer to Cooper. 
COOPER This thing is made of... gravity? 
BRAND No. I don't think it's in our universe at all. 
I think it lives in the bulk -- the space that the wormholes traverse. 
And it can only interact with us using gravity. 
The shape playfully grows around Cooper's hand, bending the space it's in, stretching the skin. 
Doyle GASPS as the sphere nearest him moves through his body, coming to rest in the middle and bending his entire torso like a fun house mirror. 
Suddenly, the sphere wrapped around Cooper's hand begins moving, tugging him gently through the cabin. 
In the next moment, all three of them are being propelled through the cabin. 
It's a magical moment -- a communion, a dance between creatures on either side of a massive, invisible wall. 
Doyle exclaims like a kid on a roller coaster as he is whirled around the room. 127. 
Cooper and Brand collide with each other for a second as the bulk beings move them through space. 
They hold onto each other for a moment and then are pulled apart again as the whirling dance continues. 
Even the fractal creature is involved -- inside its cage, a tiny distortion ripples its fractal skin. 
The creature breaks apart and plays with the distortion around its enclosure. 
Finally, Brand disengages from the dance and pulls herself around the lab, looking for some way to try to communicate with the creatures. 
She finds two heavy pieces of engineering equipment and moves them close to each other, then far apart. 
The bulk beings soon join her, mimicking the motion of the pieces of equipment. 
COOPER Can we communicate with them? 
BRAND Where would we even start? 
Maybe-- She pull a bag of ball bearings out of a storage bin and tears the bag open, releasing a cloud of the tiny shining globes into the air. 
For a moment, nothing happens. 
Then, the distortions begin moving through the bearings, shifting them, rearranging them into patterns in the air. 
First, they rearrange the ball bearings into clusters, then shapes spinning around each other -- planets orbiting around a medium-sized star. 
DOYLE That's our solar system. 
After a moment the ball bearings break apart again and rearrange into a larger, more complicated system -- Gargantua, Pantagruel, and the ice planet. 
Finally, the bearings compress to a two-dimensional sheet. 
Inside the sheet, one solitary ball bearing orbits around the stars and then pushes up, off of the sheet, into an umbrella shaped space that rises up from the sheet. 
COOPER What is that? 
Brand looks at the tiny particle, floating alone above its universe. 128. 
BRAND That's us. 
That's where they've brought us. 
We're in the bulk. 
Cooper and Doyle stare at the particle. 
The map is static now. 
Cooper looks around. 
The distortions have gone. 
The instruments on the ship TONE in alarm. 
Cooper walks through the map, sending the ball bearings scattering. 
He hurries to the instruments. 
The ship is moving -- picking up speed at a huge rate. 
BRAND (CONT'D) They're moving us. 
DOYLE Where? 
They stand, looking out into the perfect darkness. 
EXT. ENDURANCE, VACUUM The ship begins to close in on something in the darkness: a tiny point of light. 
As they grow closer, they realize that it's an opening. 
They are inside a massive, hollow sphere. 
They have been the entire time. 
The ship is guided out through the opening at the crown of the sphere. 
Below them is an astonishing sight: Our entire universe, compressed into a flattened disc, like a floor of stars. 
They are hovering above it, in the bulk, the space between universes. 
INT. ENDURANCE, BULK Brand and the others stare at the incredible display. 
The ship drops down and begins to orbit around the massive hollow sphere between them and our universe, lower and lower until it is skimming just above the surface of the sphere. 
In the distance, they can make out a cluster of lights. 
COOPER There's something out there. 
The cluster of lights grows as they are propelled closer: 129. 
It's a massive space station, built onto the surface of the sphere. 
EXT. SPACE STATION The Endurance glides to a gentle stop on one of the upper decks of the space station. 
After a moment, the airlock to the ship opens and Cooper and the others step out, in their suits. 
They walk up to the airlock doors of the station, which open automatically. 
INT. SPACE STATION After the airlock decompresses, the inner doors open. 
Standing there, waiting for them, is a familiar figure: Tars. 
TARS (DEADPAN) I guess this isn't robot heaven after all. 
The light on his brow glows and he offers them both a hand. 
INT. GRAND LABORATORY, SPACE STATION The humans have taken off their space suits -- the station has been built to be habitable by humans -- and are following Tars through the massive facility. 
TARS I orbited the black hole seven times before I hit the second wormhole. 
Then I drifted until I found this place. 
Cooper looks around. 
The halls are filled with countless technological wonders. 
COOPER This is what the Chinese were protecting. (LOOKS AROUND) How they could have built all this in just a handful of years. 
TARS They didn't. 
It took them four thousand. (off Brand's look) Time moves very slowly here 130. 
BRAND How do you know? 
TARS Because I've been waiting for you for three hundred years. 
Brand looks around at the massive facility. 
BRAND Time. 
That's what the bulk beings wanted to give us. 
That was the treasure the Chinese found. 
Enough time to let us save ourselves. 
Brand looks around. 
The facility is massive. 
She sets the specimen case down on a table. 
Even the tiny creature seems in awe of the place. 
INT. LABORATORY, SPACE STATION Tars shows them a prototype for the gravity machine. 
It is tiny -- increasing G around two spheres that attract each other with a tiny force. 
TARS I have catalogued almost everything they had built here. 
COOPER Must have taken you a while. 
TARS One hundred and fifty-seven years. 
Cooper shakes his head in disbelief. 
COOPER How are they keeping the lights on in this thing? 
Tars, in answer, points to a far door. 
TARS Follow me. 
INT. ENGINE ROOM, SPACE STATION A massive reinforced-concrete shell shudders with the energy contained within it. 
The whole room HUMS with power. 
Tars pulls up a display showing the inside of the shell: A tiny black hole spins, spewing out massive amounts of power. 131. 
TARS It's a mini black hole. 
A remnant of the big bang. 
It will power this place forever. 
Tars leads them on. 
EXT. HANGAR, SPACE STATION Tars leads them past an incredibly sleek fleet of spacecraft. 
Cooper starts to stop, but Tars doesn't slow down. 
INT. SIMULATION ROOM In the center of the room is a giant holographic globe of the Earth, perfect down to the tiniest detail. 
COOPER It's a map? 
TARS No. Not a map. 
This is a simulation of the Earth. 
A perfect simulation. 
Tars touches the control panel. 
The map zooms in over Europe. 
Down onto Paris. 
Late 20th century: People walk through the streets. 
A woman stops at a newsagent to buy a newspaper. 
Tars touches the controls again and the map zooms out. 
TARS (CONT'D) They tested each of the technologies hundreds of times, trying to find the one that would cause the least damage and still allow us to leave Earth. 
Suddenly, the map lights up with atomic explosions in every city. 
The sequence stops, rewinds. 
This time, sped up, the Earth seems to be drying up -- great swaths of desert grow across Europe and Asia. 
Massive circular ships are constructed all over the face of the Earth. 
TARS (CONT'D) This was their best solution. 
A massive version of the box we found on the ice planet, allowing the entire human population to escape. 
At a given moment, the gravity of the Earth is dropped to nothing and the massive ships, filled with the entire 132. population of the Earth, lift gently off of the planet in search of greener pastures. 
Cooper turns away from the machine, bitter. 
COOPER So why didn't they return? 
Why didn't they save us? 
Brand is staring at the massive map. 
BRAND Because they were too late. 
By the time they found this place, the people who sent them were dead. 
They were unable to fulfill their mission. 
Tars points to the next room. 
TARS That was the final problem they tried to solve. 
Tars moves on. 
EXT. PLATFORM, SPACE STATION Above them, the blackness of the sky is punctuated with hundreds of crystal shapes, faintly leaking starlight: Wormholes. 
Brand looks up at them, entranced. 
BRAND Where do they lead? 
Tars looks at an illuminated schematic on one wall, mapping some of the wormholes. 
TARS There are millions of them, connecting virtually every planetary system in the universe. 
There are thousands in our galaxy alone. 
But the Chinese stopped mapping them when they found what they were looking for. 
Tars walks further. 
He stops. 
The platform in front of them is dominated by a gigantic version of the black box that Roth found on the ice planet, connected to a massive power array, and pointing into the dark space above the sphere. 133. 
TARS (CONT'D) This was their final creation. 
They had to capture the mini black hole just to have enough power to try it. 
Several miles above the black box, one of the wormholes glows far brighter than the others, crackling with radiation. 
DOYLE What does it do? 
Cooper steps forward. 
Runs a hand on the cold, strange material the antenna is made out of. 
He knows exactly what it does. 
COOPER They weren't interested in the other wormholes because their mission was to return home. 
That one leads back to Earth. 
The Earth they were told to return to. 
Tars walks to the controls for the device. 
BRAND But that's impossible... 
Tars turns away from the machine. 
TARS It was only used once. 
The Chinese team attempted to travel back in time, to Earth just a few years after they had left. 
COOPER Did they make it? 
TARS I don't know. 
Doyle looks back to Cooper. 
DOYLE Do you really think it works? 
Cooper looks up at the machine, suddenly determined. 
COOPER We're going to find out. 
Cooper walks out of the room. 
Brand follows him. 134. 
EXT. AIRLOCK, SPACE STATION Brand follows Cooper as he walks up to the Endurance. 
BRAND You know it doesn't work. 
Time travel isn't possible. 
COOPER You don't know that. 
BRAND Yes, I do. 
If it worked, the Chinese would have suddenly discovered all of these incredible technologies. 
But they never made it. (BEAT) You can't go back, Cooper. 
You can slow things down, but you can't ever go back. 
Our home is gone. (off his look) You listened to all of those messages from your family. 
If you had made it back, we would already know. 
There would already be some evidence. 
Cooper looks at the machine. 
BRAND (CONT'D) If you try to use it, you'll die, just like the people who built it. 
She puts an arm on his shoulder. 
BRAND (CONT'D) Roth was right, Cooper. 
We have to keep going. 
Keep exploring. 
We have an obligation to try to survive. 
From here we could find a thousand places where life could thrive. 
And you're going to return to the one place where it can't. 
COOPER I made a promise. 
He turns away from her, resolute. 
EXT. HANGAR, SPACE STATION Cooper and Doyle check over one of the sleek Chinese spaceships. 135. 
INT. CHINESE SPACESHIP Cooper is checking over the controls of the ship. 
Brand walks in. 
BRAND I came to say goodbye. 
Cooper looks up at her. 
INT. HANGAR, SPACE STATION Cooper walks Brand back to the Endurance. 
The ship is packed up and repaired. 
Brand is looking over their work. 
COOPER You could have taken one of the other ships. 
BRAND This one's done all right by us so far. 
Brand holds up a small sample case containing half of the fractal life-form. 
BRAND (CONT'D) Will you take this with you? 
It's the last of its kind as well. 
Thought we should double its chances of survival. 
In case I'm wrong. 
Cooper takes the sample and looks at the tiny creature inside, trying to escape. 
He sets it inside the ship. 
Turns back to her. 
COOPER Where are you going to go? 
BRAND I don't know. 
Up there, I guess. 
She points up into the great darkness above them. 
Tars steps down. 
Moves over to them. 
COOPER You're going, too? 
TARS I'm curious. 
It's my nature. 
See you down the road? 
Tars shakes Cooper's hand. 
Heads onto the Endurance. 136. 
BRAND Come with us. 
Please. 
You wanted your whole life to explore. 
This is your chance. 
Cooper stares at her. 
This is what he has always wanted. 
And he has to turn it down. 
COOPER I'm sorry. 
I have to find out what happened to my sons. 
I promised them. 
Brand sees the resolve in his eyes. 
Knows there's no way to change his mind. 
BRAND You're a man who keeps his promises. 
Make me one- She takes his hand. 
BRAND (CONT'D) After you're done... come find me. 
COOPER I promise. 
They kiss passionately. 
Not wanting it to end but knowing that it must. 
Reluctantly, they separate. 
Brand turns back to the ship. 
She pulls herself onto the ship. 
Cooper steps back outside and watches through the tiny window as the Endurance lifts off and disappears into the darkness. 
Cooper turns away. 
EXT. PLATFORM, SPACE STATION Cooper watches as radiation pours out of the wormhole high above them. 
INT. CHINESE SPACESHIP Cooper pulls himself on board. 
Doyle is at the controls. 
He keys the controls and the ship lifts off. 
DOYLE Let's go home. 
The two men sit in silence as the ship arcs away from the space station and closes in on the wormhole. 
Cooper hears a familiar CHIRP. He turns around: 137. 
The probe they took from the ice planet is belted securely into one of the seats, filled with the garbled machine code of the gravitational machine. 
COOPER The probe... 
Doyle looks back. 
DOYLE We get back to earth, you and I can try to make sense of the code. 
Rebuild the gravity machine. 
Cooper stares at it, suddenly realizing something. 
He unbuckles himself. 
Cooper stands and walks over to the probe. 
Traces the familiar stars and stripes carved into its side. 
Cooper stares at the probe, putting it all together. 
COOPER It's going to work. 
DOYLE Of course it's going to work. 
COOPER That's not what I mean. 
This is the probe I found in Galveston. 
Below them, the wormhole breaks as it reaches another wormhole mouth that the Chinese have dropped down to a lower gravity well, creating a time machine. 
The wormhole mouth is FLARING with radiation. 
COOPER (CONT'D) Brand said there'd be some evidence we'd made it. 
And there was. 
This. (holds up probe) But only this. 
Everything will be destroyed except for this. 
He moves toward Doyle. 
Doyle stands. 
COOPER (CONT'D) We have to stop. 
DOYLE I don't know what you're talking about, but you're not touching the controls. 
I'm going home. 138. 
Cooper moves closer to Doyle. 
Doyle pulls out the flair gun. 
Points it at Cooper. 
COOPER You don't need to do this. 
We won't make it back, but this does. 
The secrets are already right on it. 
Maybe someone found it. 
There's hope. (SAD) But we don't get to go with. 
DOYLE You're not stopping me. 
I'm going home. 
Doyle forces Cooper into the ship's lander. 
Then he closes the airlock. 
Cooper pounds on the other side of the glass, trying to reason with him. 
The landing craft detaches from the ship. 
INT. CHINESE LANDING CRAFT Cooper watches, helpless, as Doyle's ship races ahead towards the glowing wormhole mouth. 
As the ship speeds toward the next wormhole, the radiation suddenly FLARES, annihilating the ship and everything in it. 
Almost everything. 
Cooper's landing craft spins away from the wormhole mouth. 
CUT TO: EXT. SPACE, OUR SOLAR SYSTEM A hole opens in the sky with a FIERY EXPLOSION. As the radiation subsides, all that shoots out of the hole is a vaporous wisp of atomized metal, and a burned, blackened probe, which hurtles toward Earth. 
EXT. SPACE, NEAR EARTH ORBIT The probe collides with a satellite, hurling debris into the upper atmosphere. 
PROBE'S ONBOARD CAMERA P.O.V. -- The probe's onboard camera documents its journey. 
Fragments OF VIDEO: 139. -- The probe HURTLES through the atmosphere, toward North America, the Gulf Coast. -- The probe SMASHES down into a sandbar. -- Daylight. 
A man is descending toward it, dangling from a rope. 
It's Cooper. -- Night. 
A kitchen. 
A little boy -- Murph -- stares at the probe, while Cooper works at it with a blowtorch. -- Tars pulls the probe out of the back of a plane. -- Brand's father, older, studies the probe. 
Gives up. -- Much later. 
People are moving around in the darkened base, scavenging equipment. 
CUT TO: EXT. FIELD -- DAY A combine harvester is dead in a field, service hatch opened. 
A MAN is lying under the machine, working. 
The man hauls himself out from under the huge machine. 
Dusts himself off. 
It's Murph, 30s. 
He looks at the FARMER who is waiting for the verdict. 
Murph shakes his head. 
MURPH It's done. 
Auto-pilot's packed up for the last time. 
FARMER You can't make it work a little longer? 
MURPH Can't do anything for you. 
There aren't any more parts for these. 
Not anywhere. 
FARMER You don't understand. 
We're getting less than a hundred pounds per acre. 
We need to plant more, not less. 
Murph looks around him at the pathetic crop of corn that stretches around them. 
The plants are feeble, barely able to support themselves. 140. 
FARMER (CONT'D) You've got to find us some more parts, Murph. 
It's getting desperate. 
Isn't there anywhere you can look? 
Murph begins packing up his tools, thinking it over. 
INT. HANGAR -- DAY Murph stares at the darkened shape of a plane under a tarp. 
He stares at the tarp, unsure if he wants to keep going. 
He pulls the tarp off, revealing Cooper's old Piper Cub. 
He checks over the engine, lights, prop. 
Turns the key. 
Fires her up. 
The diesel wakes with a GRUNT. EXT. AIRSTRIP -- DAY Murph wheels the old plane out onto the field by hand. 
EXT. SKIES OVER THE SOUTHWEST -- DAY The ancient plane skirts the San Gabriels. 
EXT. FIELD, SANTA CRUZ ISLAND Murph sets the plane down. 
He parks the plane under a copse of trees and climbs down. 
He scans the horizon. 
Nothing. 
Is this the place? 
EXT. FOREST -- DAY Murph pushes his way through the undergrowth. 
Stops. 
He's standing at the blast doors to the facility. 
They've been blown open with dynamite. 
INT. NASA FACILITY -- DAY Murph lets himself inside. 
Lights a flare. 
The place has been gutted. 
Thieves and scavengers have taken almost everything. 
Murph finds one of the robots, or what's left of it -- it's been stripped, leaving only the bare composite skeleton. 
The empty eye sockets stare back at Murph. 
Murph looks around the place. 
There is nothing left to salvage. 
He turns to leave. 
Hears a familiar CHIRP. In the corner, under a pile of rain-soaked garbage: 141. 
The probe. 
No one has bothered to steal it. 
Murph stares at it. 
INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY -- NIGHT Murph sweeps detritus off of an ancient computer mainframe that survived the looting. 
He hooks the probe up to it. 
After a minute, the screen fills with a picture of an ice- covered planet. 
Then nothing. 
The rest of the probe's drive is filled with garbage, noise. 
Murph switches off the screen. 
He stands. 
Begins to leave without the probe. 
Stops. 
Turns back. 
Picks it up and takes it with him. 
INT. KITCHEN, MURPH'S HOUSE -- NIGHT Murph is hunched over the probe, trying to pull data off of it with a defibrillator. 
He has incorporated an ancient laptop into the chain, and is tweaking values on it, trying to decrypt the contents. 
His WIFE, several months pregnant, turns back to him from the stove. 
MURPH'S WIFE Would you get that thing off of the table? 
Murph nods, absorbed. 
Keys in a final tweak to the decryption software. 
Hits return. 
Suddenly, the screen begins filling with data. 
Murph stares at it, wide eyed. 
CUT TO: INT. BARN -- NIGHT Murph, now in his 40s, is putting the finishing touches on a large machine. 
Although slightly different, we recognize some of the components and their configuration: It's a crude version of the gravitational device. 
Murph double checks it, then fires up a small gas powered generator. 
Throws a breaker, feeding power to the unit. 
The unit lights up. 
HUMS. But nothing happens. 142. 
Murph, disappointed but undaunted, shuts it down and begins checking it over. 
He hears a noise at the door. 
Turns back. 
His daughter, Emily, 8, is standing at the door. 
EMILY COOPER Dad? 
You said you'd take us to the game. 
MURPH (DISTRACTED) Did I? 
He looks at the impossible nest of wires. 
Shakes his head. 
MURPH (CONT'D) All right. 
Let me get my jacket. 
Murph picks up his jacket from the workbench. 
Next to it on the bench is a shortwave radio playing STATIC. EMILY COOPER (staring at machine) What is it supposed to do, Dad? 
MURPH I have no idea. 
Murph switches off the lights and they walk out. 
After a moment, the radio CRACKLES to life in the darkness. 
COOPER (over radio, garbled) This is the crew of the Endurance... 
Murph... 
I'm sorry... 
The signal crackles out. 
CUT TO: INT. KITCHEN, MURPH'S HOUSE -- DAY Murph, 50s, slightly gray, sits at his kitchen table. 
He hears a distant RUMBLE. He looks up. 
His wife is standing by the sink. 
MURPH Where's Emily? 
WIFE Out in the barn. 
She's been tinkering with your old projects. 143. 
Murph stands up. 
The roof of the barn is visibly shaking. 
He steps outside. 
EXT. YARD, MURPH'S HOUSE -- DAY Murph moves towards the barn, concerned. 
The shaking is growing stronger -- the entire structure is buckling. 
Emily, now 18, backs out of the barn. 
EMILY COOPER Dad... 
I'm sorry... 
I made some changes to the machine. 
I think I did something wrong. 
Murph puts an arm around his daughter and as they watch, the entire barn IMPLODES. Their tractor begins sliding towards the wreckage of the barn, chunky tires plowing up the soil. 
Finally, the RUMBLING STOPS as the power lines short out in a FIERY display. 
As the dust clears, Murph and his daughter examine the mess: The entire barn has been crushed into a tiny ball. 
Murph looks at his daughter. 
MURPH Do you remember what you changed? 
Wide-eyed, she thinks about it. 
Then nods. 
CUT TO: EXT. EARTH, 2320 -- DAY This is North America. 
But it doesn't look much like it. 
Mother Nature has just about wiped the slate clean. 
Most of the vegetation is gone, and unchecked winds sweep across the barren plains. 
Patches of ice lie think on the ground, as if a heavy snow has come and gone. 
SUPER TITLE: "TWO HUNDRED YEARS LATER" One of the Chinese spaceships descends through the thick clouds above and settles gently onto the plain. 
The hatch opens and Cooper steps out. 
He takes a cautious look around. 
He is holding the fractal life in its small container. 
The clouds are threatening, but the weather looks calm enough right here. 144. 
Cooper starts to walk. 
EXT. COLLAPSED HOUSE -- DAY Remarkably, part of Cooper's old house is still standing. 
INT. COLLAPSED HOUSE -- DAY Cooper stands in the middle of his kitchen. 
Two walls are missing and the rest is collapsed in a heap. 
But he can still see where he used to feed his kids breakfast. 
He has kept his promise. 
Several hundred years too late. 
Cooper hunkers down, staring at the space where his kids used to be. 
Rainwater covers the ancient formica. 
It has taken him years to finally reach this place. 
He has had plenty of time to come to grips with what he might find. 
But nothing has prepared him for this: He is completely alone. 
Nothing is left. 
INT. COLLAPSED FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT Cooper is still sitting there when the ice storm hits. 
Unchecked by trees or vegetation, the wind rockets through the house, blasting Cooper and pelting what's left of the structure with fist-sized hail. 
Cooper takes shelter against the remaining wall. 
He's going to have to sit this one out -- the hail and winds are the brutal descendants of the weather he knew. 
They'll finish him off if he steps back outside. 
As he watches, the pool of water on the kitchen floor freezes over in seconds. 
INT. COLLAPSED FARMHOUSE -- DAWN Cooper shivers, pressed against the wall. 
The storm is still raging outside. 
He is freezing to death. 
He has to move now or he will die. 
He pulls the hood tight around his face and stumbles outside. 
EXT. SNOWBOUND FIELD -- DAY Cooper makes his way through the blinding snow. 
He tries to find his way, but the ship has been consumed by the blizzard. 
He stumbles to the ground, dropping the glass case with the fractal wildlife in it. 
The case shatters. 
Cooper tries to stand back up, but his strength is dwindling. 145. 
As he watches, the fractal wildlife creeps tentatively out of its broken habitat. 
It forms together against the cold. 
After a moment, it burrows into the ice. 
As it does, the ice glows faintly. 
It seems to be right at home. 
Cooper laughs, glimpsing the outline of a plan. 
Was this what the beings who made the wormhole intended all along? 
Cooper suddenly spots the outline of the ship through the driving snow. 
He stumbles back up to his feet and struggles a few more steps, then stumbles again, spent. 
Finally, he sits down in the snow to die. 
As his senses flicker in and out, he is struck with memories of his boys, so vivid he reaches out for them, crawling forward in the snow. 
He stops, and laughs, remembering what Case told him about what happens when humans die. 
He struggles to his feet and stumbles a few more feet, eventually coming to rest just steps from the ship. 
Cooper takes a final step. 
Finally, he collapses under his ship, as the wind continues to HOWL around him. 
As the snow clears for a moment, Cooper is alone on a vast arctic tundra. 
He will die alone. 
BLACK FADE IN: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY Cooper wakes. 
He is in a sunlit room. 
A breeze rustles the curtains as it makes its way in through a large open window. 
Cooper sits up. 
As he a does, a control panel on the wall TONES gently, as if in response to his movement. 
He stands and looks around. 
He can see sunlight through the open windows and hear people -- kids YELLING as they play. 
He moves toward the window. 
Reaches for the curtains. 
Before he can, the door opens behind him. 
A WOMAN in a white coat steps in, smiling warmly. 
DOCTOR Good morning. 
Don't go outside just yet, Mr. Cooper. (MORE) 146. 
DOCTOR (CONT'D) (offers him a pill) This will help with the disorientation. 
Cooper opens his mouth to talk, but his voice is cracked. 
He gives up. 
Swallows the pill. 
DOCTOR (CONT'D) Wait a minute for that to take effect. 
It can be a bit of an adjustment. (looks him over) You had some frostbite. 
Nothing too serious. 
As she talks, Cooper looks past her to the window. 
COOPER Where am I? 
DOCTOR (SMILES) It's a bit of a coincidence, really. 
When the rangers found you, we were the nearest facility. 
COOPER What's coincidence? 
What is this place? 
DOCTOR We have a lot to show you. 
The doctor reaches for the curtains. 
She offers him a hand. 
Cooper declines the help and steps outside. 
EXT. HOSPICE, COOPER STATION -- DAY Cooper is standing on a rooftop deck of a four-story building in a medium-sized city surrounded by fields. 
But as the road and the buildings stretch into the distance, the landscape curves up, not down. 
The entire landscape is contained within a huge cylinder- shaped space station. 
Cooper stumbles, and reaches instinctively out. 
The doctor catches him. 
DOCTOR You're OK. We get this from people who move here from planetary colonies all the time. 147. 
COOPER Where... where are we? 
DOCTOR Like I said. 
It was a coincidence. 
There was a facility closer to Earth, but they had a problem, so you wound up here. (off his look) This is the Space Station Joseph A. 
Cooper. 
Cooper takes in the incredible surroundings. 
A thousand feet above them, black specks are sprinkled over an ocean of green -- Jersey milking cows grazing in a field of wild grass. 
DOCTOR (CONT'D) I've got someone who wants to meet you. 
Cooper looks at her. 
INT. INTENSIVE CARE ROOM, HOSPICE, COOPER STATION -- DAY Cooper steps inside. 
The room is dark, still, the only noise is the labored RATTLE of an old man struggling to breathe. 
Cooper steps closer to the bed. 
The man's skin is paper- thin. 
He is ancient. 
DOCTOR He was moved here after they found you. 
He's a little old for a transfer, but they made an exception. 
Cooper hovers at the back of the room, unsure. 
He turns to the doctor, questioning. 
Then he notices the pictures on the old man's desk: There are dozens of them. 
Children, grandchildren. 
Then the older ones -- the man's own parents. 
Grandparents. 
Cooper spots a tiny framed picture with someone he recognizes: Murph, 80 years old, surrounded by his daughter and her family. 
They are standing in front of a re-opened Cape Canaveral, and a huge spaceship under construction. 
Cooper picks up the picture and stares at it. 
The doctor points to a shy little boy hiding behind Murph's leg in the picture. 
DOCTOR (CONT'D) That's him. 148. 
She points to the old man lying in the bed. 
DOCTOR (CONT'D) His name is Anthony Welling. 
Anthony Cooper Welling. (SMILES) He's your great great grandson. 
He's been waiting a long time for you. 
Cooper's eyes well with tears. 
He steps over to the bed and looks down at the ancient man, teetering on the edge of death. 
The old man looks at him, eyes widening in excitement. 
He strains, trying to reach the bedside table. 
He's trying to reach the drawer. 
Cooper helps him open it. 
Inside is a simple, familiar wristwatch. 
The old man carefully takes out the watch. 
He gives the watch a few winds and, hands shaking, offers it to Cooper. 
Cooper, eyes filling with tears, closes his hand over the old man's hand, enveloping both the watch and the man's hand. 
CUT TO: EXT. CORNFIELD, COOPER STATION -- MORNING Cooper is sitting in a well-appointed office. 
A middle-aged BUREAUCRAT smiles at him from the far side of a huge desk. 
ADMINISTRATOR You're a hero, Mr. Cooper. 
Let's just start off by saying that. 
It's an incredible and... unexpected honor to have you here with us. 
Cooper smiles, uncomfortable. 
ADMINISTRATOR (CONT'D) None of us would be here without the efforts of you and the other crewmembers of the Endurance. (smiles, unconvincingly) So I don't want you to take this the wrong way. 
But there are some questions I've been told to ask. 
The man looks petrified, like he's been instructed to grill George Washington on his expense reports. 
COOPER Shoot. 149. 
ADMINISTRATOR The rangers who found you reported that you had released a sample of an alien life-form into the wild. 
Which is, unfortunately, against regulations. 
COOPER It was last of its kind. 
Their planet was destroyed. 
The administrator cues up a series of images on his computer. 
ADMINISTRATOR The rangers attempted to isolate the life-form, but it had already spread out of control. 
It seems to be thriving. 
He shows Cooper a satellite image of north america. 
A considerable portion of the frozen tundra is glowing. 
Cooper begins laughing. 
Which makes the administrator even less comfortable. 
ADMINISTRATOR (CONT'D) Can you tell me why you... elected to release the life-form back on earth? 
Cooper is still laughing. 
COOPER Because that was the plan. 
ADMINISTRATOR Whose plan? 
COOPER (SMILES) I don't know. 
The administrator tries to smile back. 
Makes a few notes in his file. 
Changes the subject. 
ADMINISTRATOR My assistant tells me you've applied for a position with the exploration fleet. 
COOPER Feel like I should be pulling my weight. 150. 
ADMINISTRATOR That's admirable, Mr. Cooper. 
The truth is, most of the fleet's personnel are automated. 
There are a small number of crewed ships. 
But there are great numbers of candidates. 
Very well trained candidates. 
COOPER I was hoping to enroll in a course. 
Try to get myself up to speed on the new systems. 
ADMINISTRATOR I don't want you to take this the wrong way, Mr. Cooper -- like I said, you're a hero. 
But the truth is we have somewhat limited resources. 
Cooper remembers this conversation. 
He looks down. 
COOPER No one's heard anything from Brand? 
ADMINISTRATOR I'm sorry. 
Officially, she's been listed as missing for over 200 years. 
Mind you, I guess you turned up eventually, didn't you? 
COOPER Am I really going to hurt anybody by going to look for her? 
I just need a small ship. 
I made a promise. 
The bureaucrat looks down. 
Is he really going to have to tell this guy the lay of the land? 
ADMINISTRATOR Listen. 
Mr. Cooper. 
You're a hero. 
You're the oldest man in the human race. 
Don't you want to take it easy? (off his look) I hope you understand, we all you hold you in the highest possible regard. (QUIET) Which is why they're never going to let you go off by yourself in a spaceship. 
I'm sorry. 
Cooper looks at his hands. 
He's got a couple centuries on the bureaucrat in Earth years, but looks ten years younger. 
He puts his hands in his pockets. 151. 
ADMINISTRATOR (CONT'D) I've got some good news, however. (BIG SMILE) We all know about your early life, Mr Cooper. 
I wrote a paper on it when I was a boy. 
And I think we found something you'll really enjoy. 
EXT. CORNFIELD, COOPER STATION -- DAY Corn blows in an artificial breeze. 
A red tractor makes its way through the field, which curves gently up in the distance. 
ADMINISTRATOR (V.O.) The machines do most of the work, of course, but we were able to get you a few acres. 
You're going to be a farmer again. 
After a moment, the tractor stops. 
Cooper climbs down from the seat. 
Looks at the front steering linkage, which is jammed with an errant tree branch. 
He wipes his forehead and begins working the branch out of the machine. 
He looks miserable. 
A robot, a similar unit to Tars, walks over. 
Offers Cooper a bottle of water. 
Cooper accepts it. 
EXT. HANGAR BAY, COOPER STATION Cooper stands on an observation deck, high above the hangar floor. 
Below him, bright young things in uniforms climb into sleek-looking spaceships and prepare to set out. 
EXT. BASEBALL DIAMOND, COOPER STATION Cooper sits in the stands, listening to the familiar crack of the bat as an intramural team from the university practices. 
Cooper watches. 
He looks bored. 
The kid up to bat cracks a pop fly. 
For a second, the catcher shuffles back and forth, trying to get himself into position. 
But the ball never returns. 
The catcher YELLS out a warning. 
Above, the ball begins to slowly fall up, not down, toward the town center above. 
After a second, the ball smashes through a skylight of a building high above them. 
Cooper watches as the kid rounds the bases, laughing. 152. 
INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE, COOPER STATION -- DAY Cooper's robot sits at the kitchen table. 
Cooper is fiddling around in the back of his head. 
ROBOT Settings: general settings, security SETTINGS-- COOPER Curiosity. 
New level setting. 100 percent. 
ROBOT Confirmed. 
Would you like to make any additional changes? 
COOPER Sense of humor. 
New level setting. 100 percent. 
Wait. (THINKS) 80 percent. 
He begins putting the robot back together. 
EXT. FARMHOUSE, COOPER STATION -- TWILIGHT Cooper sits on his porch, joined by the same robot as before. 
They watch as the space station rotates lazily out of alignment with the local star, casting the inside of the cylinder into shade, then darkness. 
The shadow races past them. 
Another day. 
Another night. 
EXT. HANGAR, COOPER STATION A maintenance worker finishes looking over one of the sleek- looking spacecraft. 
He packs up his tools and heads out. 
After a moment, two figures pick their way across the hangar floor, sticking to the shadows. 
As they reach the first ship in the line, we get a better look. 
It's Cooper and his robot pal. 
The robot is wearing a baseball cap and carrying a toolbox. 
Cooper gestures to the robot, who sets down the toolbox with a click against the mirror-like floor. 
Cooper shakes his head, annoyed, at the robot, and puts his finger to his lips. 
The robot nods, bashful. 
Cooper waves a small handheld computer near the skin of the ship until it lights up. 
Then he punches in a few codes. 
Nothing happens. 
He punches in a few more. 153. 
Suddenly, the hatch opens with a HISS. INT. SHIP Cooper moves quickly to the cockpit of the ship. 
Looks over the controls. 
The robot straps himself in next to him. 
Cooper looks up through the windows. 
The inky black void of space beckons. 
Cooper smiles and reaches for the controls. 
COOPER Where do you want to go first? 
The robot thinks it over. 
EXT. HANGAR, COOPER STATION The technician walks back into the hangar. 
He walks along the row of ships till he reaches the last one. 
It's not there. 
He looks out into the blackness of the void. 
Sees a tiny glowing speck, getting smaller and smaller. 
THE END
BIRDMAN Written by Alejandro G. 
Inarritu Nicolas Giacobone Alexander Dinelaris, Jr. Armando Bo 1 BLACK 1 We hear a clock ticking. 
FADE IN: 1 INT. RIGGAN'S DRESSING ROOM - THEATER - DAY 1 Close on the brilliant colors of a middle eastern rug, the center of what seems to be a makeshift "meditation" space. 
We slowly tilt up to discover the back of Riggan Thomson (55). 
He is in the proper `Lotus' position, dressed only in tight white briefs and he appears to be meditating deeply. 
And if all this seems a little odd, it becomes all the more so when you notice that he is levitating almost two feet above the floor. 
His breath is calm and measured... in and out... in and out. 
MAN (V.O.) How did we end up here? (Beat.) This place is a fucking dump. 
We begin to slowly move toward Riggan's back while his measure breathing continues. 
We see a clock on the wall, ticking. 
MAN (V.O.) Smells like balls. 
A slight twitch in Riggan's neck. 
MAN (V.O.) We don't belong in this shithole. 
A Skype call shatters the silence. 
Close on his back, we follow Riggan as he walks over to the computer and answers the call. 
On the computer screen appears Sam (21), in a pair of Levi's and a Led Zeppelin T-shirt. 
She has simple and striking good looks, with an edge in her voice and behind her eyes. 
She stands in a Korean Deli among the flowers, talking to Riggan through her iPhone. 1A 1A The Korean Store owner (50) stands in the background screaming at her the whole time. 
RIGGAN Sam, I can't-- (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 2. 
SAM Dad? 
What kind of-- (Turning to Korean.) SHUT UP!!! (Back to screen.) What kind of flowers did you say you wanted? 
RIGGAN Alchemillas. 
Or something soothing that smells nice. 
Listen I can't-- SAM It all smells like fucking Kimchi! RIGGAN Then whatever looks nice. 
Anything but roses. 
No roses. 
KOREAN Flowers don't need you touch! They need you buy!!! SAM (Close into the screen.) I hate this job. 
And the Skype call is over. 
Riggan closes the laptop and leans forward trying to regain his calm. 
His reflection appears in the mirror, and for the first time we see his face. 
He has a dark goatee and his hair looks strangely abundant. 
There is a piece of paper on the mirror with the handwritten phrase "A thing is a thing, not what it is said of that thing." ANNIE ON SPEAKERS Riggan, they're starting scene five. 
We need you on stage. 
RIGGAN Shit... 
Riggan throws on a sweater and stumbles into his slacks. 
He hurries out... 2 INT. HALLWAYS - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 2 ...through the narrow corridors of the theater. 
There is a lot of activity as various workers and stage hands appear and disappear carrying equipment and scenery. 
As Riggan descends the stairs, a Stage Hand· passes by in the opposite direction. 
STAGE HAND· Mr. Thomson. (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 3. 
RIGGAN Steve. 
STAGE HAND· It's Daniel. 
RIGGAN (Already passed.) Okay. 
Riggan continues on until he arrives backstage. 
He runs into Jake (42) his producer and friend. 
JAKE How's it going, buddy. 
RIGGAN Great. 
It'd be even better if I could get Ralph to stop acting like he's in an educational video for syphilis... 
The camera moves off of them and onto... 3 INT. STAGE - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 3 ...the stage. 
Suddenly we are in the midst of an Americana style kitchen. 
Around the kitchen table sit Lesley (35), plain and no nonsense, her simple hairstyle and makeup can't hide how attractive she is. 
Laura (35), dark, exotic, the kind of woman who makes every person she meets feel like she's seducing them. 
And Ralph (40), slightly handsome, slightly balding, slightly invisible. 
A half empty bottle of gin on the table, they drink from highball glasses as they chat... 
LESLEY He loved me. 
RALPH Yeah. 
He loved her so much he tried to kill her. 
LAURA He tried to kill you? 
LESLEY No. (A beat.) Okay, well, he did beat me up one night. 
He dragged me around the living room by my ankles, yelling "I love you, I love (MORE) (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 4. 
LESLEY (CONT'D) you, bitch." What do you do with a love like that? 
RALPH How is that-- That is not love and you know it. 
Why do you insist on calling it-- LESLEY You can say what you want, but I know what it was. 
RALPH What about you, Nick? 
Does that sound like love to you? 
Riggan arrives at the table and sits. 
RIGGAN Sorry I'm late. (Beat. 
In character.) I'm the wrong person to ask. 
I didn't know the man. 
I've only heard his name mentioned in passing. 
You'd have to know the particulars. 
But I think what you're saying is that love is absolute. 
RALPH Yeah. 
The kind of love I'm talking about is... 
The kind of love I'm talking about, you don't try and kill people. 
LESLEY (Sadly.) It was love, Mel. 
To Eddie, it was. 
I don't care what anybody says. 
He was ready to die for it. 
RALPH Ask her what he did after she left him. 
LESLEY He shot himself in the mouth. 
But he screwed that up, too. 
Poor Ed. RALPH Poor Ed, my ass. 
The guy was dangerous. 
LAURA How'd he screw it up if he shot himself in the mouth? 
RALPH (By the numbers.) He used to carry this twenty-two. 
We lived like fugitives those days. 
I never knew-- (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 5. 
RIGGAN (Breaking character to direct. 
Exasperated.) Okay. 
Fugitives are on the run, Ralph. 
How many times do I have to-- Fugitives are scared. 
Give me more of that. 
Ralph nods. 
He takes a breath and dives in once again... 
RALPH (The same but louder.) We lived like fugitives those days... 
Extremely frustrated, Riggan stares out into the auditorium. 
From his POV we see Jake who is now sitting in the third row. 
His head buried in his hands, tortured by Ralph's performance. 
Riggan turns back to Ralph. 
RALPH (CONT'D) ...I never knew if he was going to come out of the bushes or from behind a car and just start shooting. 
Riggan watches Ralph act and sees his whole production headed down the drain. 
Ralph is just that bad. 
RALPH (CONT'D) The man was crazy. 
He was capable of anything. 
The actors all wait for a cue from Riggan, who is now staring up into the lights above the stage. 
Laura finally picks up Riggan's cue. 
LAURA Christ. 
What a nightmare... 
RALPH He used to call me at the hospital and say... (Over the top.) "Son of a bitch. 
Your days are numbered." Silence. 
Ralph looks over to Riggan. 
RALPH (CONT'D) Too much? 
Little bit? 
I just wanted to give you a range, so you could-- And with that a light comes barreling down from it's perch and crashes into Ralph's head, making him hit the floor like a rag doll. 
Silence. 
LAURA Holy shit. (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 6. 
Lesley and Annie (35), the Stage Manager, run over to Ralph who is out cold. 
Not knowing what to do, they stare at him. 
LESLEY Is he breathing? 
Jake runs toward the stage. 
JAKE Someone call 911! Riggan slowly backs away from the chaos. 
LAURA Is that blood coming out of his ear? 
JAKE (To Riggan.) Where are you going? 
LESLEY Okay, he's breathing. 
What did he have for lunch? 
LAURA Did anyone call for help? 
ANNIE (Clapping.) Wake up! Wake up! Two crew members try to help Ralph. 
CREW MEMBER Grab his legs. 
I got the top. 
JAKE Don't move him! Wait for the ambulance. (Calling out.) For the love of God! I could get a black audience in this theater faster than a doctor! Riggan heads off the stage, and Jake chases after him. 
We follow them as... 4 INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 4 ...they walk through the corridor. 
JAKE Where are you going? 
We'll have the understudy ready to rehearse in five-- (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 7. 
RIGGAN Forget the understudy. 
We have to postpone the preview. 
JAKE What are you-- It's a full house. 
We would have to refund all the-- RIGGAN Then do it. 
A crew member· passes in the opposite direction. 
CREW MEMBER· How's Ralph? 
RIGGAN He'll be fine. 
JAKE Wait. 
Wait. 
Fuck. 
Wait. 
RIGGAN Listen to me. 
It was going to be a disaster. 
That guy's the worst actor I've ever seen. 
The blood coming out of his ear was the most honest thing he's done so far. 
JAKE He's not that bad. 
Riggan stops in his tracks and stares at Jake. 
JAKE (CONT'D) Okay, he's fucking horrible. 
But-- Riggan starts walking again. 
JAKE (CONT'D) You have the press in your dressing room in a few hours. 
How are we-- RIGGAN I'll make something up. 
Two Technicians· hurry up in the opposite direction. 
RIGGAN (CONT'D) Jake. 
This happened for a reason. 
It wasn't an accident. 
JAKE What do you mean? (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 8. 
RIGGAN I-- (A beat.) I made it happen. 
JAKE Oh. Okay. (Beat.) Are you drunk? 
RIGGAN Find me an actor. 
A good actor. 
Philip Seymour Hoffman... 
JAKE He's doing the third Hunger Games. 
RIGGAN Michael Fassbender? 
JAKE Doing the prequel to the X-Men prequel. 
They arrive at Riggan's dressing room. 
RIGGAN What's his name? 
Jeremy Renner... 
JAKE Who? 
RIGGAN The... the Hurt Locker guy. 
JAKE Yeah. 
He's an Avenger. 
RIGGAN (With disgust.) Fuck. 
They put him in a cape, too? (A beat.) Look, I don't care. 
Find me someone. 
Riggan enters... 5 INT. RIGGAN'S DRESSING ROOM - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 5 ...his dressing room and tries to shut the door. 
Jake, still in the corridor, stops it with his foot. 
JAKE (Sticking his head in.) Ralph'll sue us. 
He'll sue us. 
And he's got a case. (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 9. 
Riggan releases the door. 
RIGGAN Then make him go away. 
JAKE How do you suggest I do that? 
RIGGAN You're my lawyer, my producer and my oldest friend. 
We are going to make this work. 
Now just get out there and do what you were born to do. 
JAKE What's that? 
RIGGAN I have no idea. 
But I have faith. 
Now go away from me. 
JAKE Do you think we should-- Riggan slams the door shut on Jake. 
A beat. 
On a television, a segment of E! News. 
A busty blond, with an exaggerated smile, hosts. 
BLOND WOMAN ...and when we come back, an exclusive interview with Robert Downey Jr., who tells us about the billion-dollar Iron Man franchise. 
The talented actor invited us onto the set of Iron Man 3... 
Riggan slams the tv off, his mind racing. 
He sits on a chair. 
MAN (V.O.) That clown doesn't have half your talent and he's making a fortune in that Tin Man get up. 
Riggan stares into the mirror, in the reflection he catches sight of a poster from a movie called "Birdman 3". 
The superhero, Birdman (a younger Riggan in a bird costume), wings widely spread, stares directly back at him. 
A hand written note on the top of the poster reads: "Thomson, break a wing! From the boys at Local 1." Riggan tries to calm himself with a mantra... 
RIGGAN "Breathing in, I embrace my anger. 
Breathing out, I smile to it." (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 10. 
BIRDMAN (V.O.) Embrace it. 
Kiss it. 
Turn it around and fuck it in the-- A knock on the door behind him. 
RIGGAN Not now! Laura opens the door and sticks her head in. 
LAURA Can I come in? 
RIGGAN No. LAURA Okay. 
Two words. 
Shia La Beouf. 
RIGGAN That's three words. 
LAURA It's two. 
RIGGAN Get out. 
LAURA I love you. 
She closes the door. 
Riggan tries to calm himself down, but Laura opens the door again. 
LAURA (CONT'D) I take it we're not going to dinner anymore? 
RIGGAN I don't have an actor. 
LAURA I don't have a life. 
RIGGAN Laura... 
LAURA Fine. 
Whatever. (Goes to leave but stops.) You remember at Joan's when you asked me to come do a Broadway play with you? 
You said it would be fun... (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 11. 
RIGGAN Go away. 
LAURA So far? 
No fun. 
Riggan closes the door and looks at the Birdman poster. 
BIRDMAN (V.O.) Fun? 
You know what would be fun? 
Getting the fuck out of here before we humiliate ourselves. 
That would be fun. 
Riggan looks at himself in the mirror and begins to pull at his hair. 
As it comes off his head, we discover it was a wig. 
He turns away from the mirror, trying desperately to stay calm. 
Something catches his eye: a vase of roses on the end of the table. 
A card in them says, "They didn't have the whatever you wanted - Sam". 
Enraged, Riggan focuses on the vase. 
It begins to shift. 
Then, with a surge of anger, without ever touching it, he sends it crashing against the wall on the other side of the room. 
The camera pans over the roses scattered across the floor. 
It hovers over the carpet and around the perimeter of the room, until it finally settles on Riggan, now dressed in a casual blazer. 
A5 A5 It is later the same day. 
He is sitting on the sofa and on three chairs in front of him are three journalists: Gabriel, a geeky theatre journalist, wearing thick glasses and a thin tie. 
Clara, a reporter from an entertainment blog. 
And Han, a polite, obese Japanese journalist, who sits next to his translator, another Japanese guy. 
GABRIEL Why does somebody go from playing the lead in a comic book franchise to adapting Raymond Carver for the stage? 
Riggan tries to remain calm. 
GABRIEL (CONT'D) I mean, as you're probably aware, Barthes said, "The cultural work done in the past by gods and epic sagas is now done by laundry detergent commercials and comic strip characters." It's a big leap you've taken... 
Riggan shifts nervously. (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 12. 
RIGGAN Well... 
Absolutely. 
As you said... that Barthes said... 
Birdman, like Icarus... 
CLARA Hang on. 
Who's this Barthes guy? 
Which Birdman was he in? 
GABRIEL Roland Barthes was a French philosopher, who-- CLARA Oh. Okay. 
Sure. 
Now, is it true you've been injecting yourself with semen from baby pigs? 
RIGGAN What? 
CLARA As a method of facial rejuvenation. 
RIGGAN Who told you that? 
CLARA It was tweeted by... (checks her notes) @prostatewhispers. 
RIGGAN It's a lie. 
CLARA I know. 
But did you do it? 
RIGGAN No! GABRIEL Are you afraid at all that people will say you're doing this play to battle the impression that you're a washed-up super hero? 
RIGGAN No. I'm not. 
And that's exactly why 20 years ago I refused to do Birdman 4. 
HAN Birdman 4??? 
You do Birdman 4??? 
Jake opens the door and the camera pans to him. (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 13. 
JAKE Okay. 
That's enough for today. 
Thank you for coming. 
We're expecting some great pieces from you... 
Riggan stares at the Birdman poster. 
JAKE (CONT'D) Publicity guys are trying to get you a Times feature. 
Riggan stands up and pulls the Birdman poster off of the wall. 
JAKE (CONT'D) So, How'd it-- Whoa. 
If I were you I wouldn't do that. 
RIGGAN I don't want to look at it anymore. 
JAKE That was a present from the crew. 
Don't fuck with those guys, they're union. 
RIGGAN I don't care. 
Riggan leaves the poster on the floor, facing the wall, and walks to the window. 
He opens it. 
We can hear distant drums coming from the street. 
JAKE So... 
How'd it go? 
RIGGAN Great. 
JAKE (Worried.) Did they ask about Ralph? 
RIGGAN Nope. 
JAKE Good. 
He did it, you know? 
The motherfucker threatened to sue us. 
Didn't even wait to get out of the hospital. 
RIGGAN And, what did you say? (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 14. 
JAKE What'd I say? 
I said, "You motherfucker. 
You're threatening me? 
ME? I swear to god, you fuck, I so much as get a letter from a lawyer, the press'll get the pictures we got off your computer." RIGGAN What pictures? 
JAKE The guy has a thing for nuns... in diapers. 
What do you care? 
You shouldn't have any knowledge about it anyway. 
The important thing is that I made him go away. 
RIGGAN Right. 
That's great. 
JAKE Yeah, it's fantastic. 
One problem. 
We don't have an actor. 
And if we cancel the first preview the press will smell the blood. 
We can't afford to lose any more money. 
At all. 
RIGGAN What do you want me to do? 
JAKE We pay an understudy, let's use the understudy. 
RIGGAN No. JAKE No? Riggan, listen to me. 
Our dream actor is not going to knock on that door and say: "Hey fellas, when do we start?" B5 B5 There is a knock at the door. 
Leslie peeks in. 
LESLIE Can I talk to you for a second? 
RIGGAN Yeah. 
What's up? (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 15. 
LESLIE Did you find another actor? 
RIGGAN No. LESLIE Okay. 
Well... 
Mike's available. 
RIGGAN He is? 
JAKE Mike who? 
RIGGAN I thought he was doing-- LESLIE He was. 
He quit. 
Or got fired. 
JAKE Mike who? 
RIGGAN Which one? 
Quit or fired? 
LESLIE With Mike it's usually both. 
JAKE Mike Fucking Who? 
LESLIE Shiner. 
JAKE Yes! RIGGAN Jake... 
JAKE Yes! How do you know Mike Shiner? 
LESLIE We share a vagina. 
RIGGAN You think he'd want to do it? 
LESLIE Yeah. (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 16. 
JAKE How do you know? 
LESLIE Because he said he'd want to do it. 
JAKE Yes! RIGGAN Jake. 
Hang on a minute. 
JAKE (to Riggan) Ask me if he sells tickets. 
RIGGAN Does he sell tickets? 
JAKE A shitload of tickets. 
Now ask me if the critics like him? 
RIGGAN Do they like him? 
JAKE They want to spooge on him. 
RIGGAN (Indicating Lesley.) Hey. 
JAKE Leslie... 
LESLIE Right on his face. 
JAKE Everything for a reason, right? 
RIGGAN You think he'll be able to come tonight? 
LESLEY I can call him and find out. 
Riggan gives Jake a look. 
JAKE I'll call his agent. 
Jake charges out of the room. 
The camera follows him into... 10/29/14 / 17. 6 INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 6 ...the hallway and as Jake makes a left turn, Annie enters from the right. 
JAKE Annie, turn the work lights on and get me a fresh copy of the script. 
We're gonna have a "put in" tonight. 
ANNIE Who? 
JAKE You'll find out... 
Jake disappears down the hall and we follow Annie through the theater and onto... 7 INT. STAGE - THEATER - EVENING 7 ...the stage, where she turns some of the stage work lights on. 
We pan along the stage until we find Riggan, wearing the same clothes as before, scanning the empty auditorium. 
MIKE (O.S.) Intimidating. 
Isn't it? 
Riggan sees Mike Shiner (39) coming down the aisle, slovenly dressed with mussed hair and intense eyes. 
MIKE (CONT'D) Do you have any idea who walked these boards before you? (Beat.) Geraldine Page, Marlon Brando, Helen Hayes, Jason Robards... 
And now you. 
Riggan Thomson. 
Riggan, trying to hide the intimidation. 
RIGGAN Thanks for coming on such short notice, Mike. 
I appreciate it. 
MIKE Hey. 
This is what we do. (Indicates a script.) So, you wrote this adaptation? 
RIGGAN I did. (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 18. 
MIKE And you're directing the adaptation and starring... 
RIGGAN I am. 
MIKE Ambitious. 
RIGGAN Thank you. 
A sly smile from Mike. 
He leaps onto the stage. 
MIKE Why don't we do a bit of it? 
RIGGAN Hey, I wasn't expecting you to-- MIKE First preview is tomorrow, right? 
RIGGAN Yeah, but you can go on with the script until you feel comfortable-- MIKE Let's just do some of it. 
Riggan tries to hide his excitement. 
He grabs the script from a nearby table and walks it over to Mike. 
RIGGAN Take a look at page twenty-- MIKE Yeah. 
I don't need that. 
RIGGAN What? 
MIKE I don't need the script. 
Just give me a cue. 
RIGGAN What are you talking about? 
MIKE Feed me a line. 
RIGGAN I don't-- What? (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 19. 
MIKE Feed. 
Me. A line. 
Riggan drops the script and begins the scene. 
RIGGAN "I'm the wrong person to ask. 
I didn't know the man. 
I've only heard his name mentioned in passing. 
I wouldn't know. 
You'd have to know the particulars. 
But I think what you're saying is that love is absolute." Mike stares at Riggan, hyper-focused. 
MIKE (Ruminating.) Am I saying that love is absolute? (He transforms.) "Yeah. 
The kind of love I'm talking about is. 
The kind of love I'm talking about you-- " (An intense pause.) Well, you don't try to kill people. 
Riggan is transfixed, and almost immediately intimidated. 
RIGGAN How do you know the lines? 
MIKE I have a thing, a whatever, a gift. (A beat.) Come on, I helped Lesley get off book. 
Hey, give me that cue again. 
RIGGAN "I'm the wrong person to ask. 
I didn't know the man. 
I've only heard his name mentioned in passing. 
I wouldn't know. 
You'd have to know the particulars. 
But I think what you're saying is--" MIKE Okay, can I-- Do you mind if I-- RIGGAN No, go ahead. 
MIKE Follow me. 
He says, "I'm the wrong person to ask." What's his intention? 
Is he fed up with the topic? 
Deflecting? 
Guilt about his wife maybe? 
Then four sentences all say the same thing... "I didn't even know the man." (MORE) (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 20. 
MIKE (CONT'D) "I've only heard his name mentioned in passing." "I wouldn't know." "You'd have to know the particulars." First of all, particulars? 
What are you, my grandmother? 
But the point is, YOU DON'T KNOW THE GUY, WE FUCKING GET IT. Make it one line. "I didn't even know the guy." Right? ... 
RIGGAN You pretty much know my lines too, huh? 
MIKE Can we-- Are we doing something here? 
Come on let's go. 
Cut it down, give it to me again. 
RIGGAN "I'm the wrong person to ask--" MIKE Oh, right, sorry, you see? "I'm the wrong person to ask?" That's another fuck you. "Don't put me on the spot. 
Don't make me self conscious about my marriage when my wife is sitting right here..." See? 
Give it to me. 
Give me a good fuck you. 
Come on... 
RIGGAN Okay, let me-- MIKE Come on. 
Give it to me right now. 
Fuck me. 
Right now. 
Right here. 
Let's do it. 
RIGGAN Okay, yeah... 
MIKE DO IT! RIGGAN (Jumps in w/out thinking.) "Hey. 
I'm the wrong person to ask, okay? 
I didn't even know the guy. 
So what's your point?" MIKE "What's my point?" RIGGAN "What's your point? 
What are you saying? 
Spit it out. 
You're saying, what? 
That love is an absolute?" (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 21. 
MIKE (Exploding.) "Yeah! Alright? 
The kind of love I'm talking about is absolute. 
The kind of love I'm talking about you-- (A painful memory.) Well, you don't try to kill people. 
Riggan stands silently, his heart pounding. 
MIKE (CONT'D) So what do you think, boss? 
Do I have a job? 
Riggan calls over to the wings. 
RIGGAN What do you think? 
Mike turns to see Sam, who has been there for a bit. 
SAM Larry needs to see him for a fitting. 
MIKE I'm gonna take that as a yes. (Walking to Sam.) And you are...? 
RIGGAN That's my daughter, Sam. 
MIKE Right. 
Yeah. 
I can see it around the... (A beat) She doesn't look anything like you. (To Sam.) And your job is...? 
RIGGAN She's my assistant. 
MIKE Your assistant... (To Sam.) And can you speak? 
SAM Yup. 
I can even 'sit', 'stay' or 'roll over' if you have any treats. 
RIGGAN Welcome aboard, Mike. (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 22. 
MIKE (Mock saluting.) Thank you, Captain. 
We follow Mike and Sam off as they... 8 INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 8 ...advance through the hallways. 
MIKE I'm Mike Shiner, by the way. 
SAM I know who you are. (Reluctantly honest.) I saw you in 'Hothouse' at the Geffen. 
It was... great. 
MIKE That ass is great. 
She turns her head toward him with a disgusted expression. 
SAM Dude. 
Seriously? 
Moving by her, into a dressing room. 
MIKE This is the theatre, honey. 
Don't be so self-conscious. 
She follows him into the room where we see... 9 INT. COSTUME DEPARTMENT - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 9 ...Larry stressing out while he works on a costume. 
He turns to see Mike standing there. 
Sam stands against the wall, focused on her cell phone. 
LARRY Oh, thank the Lord and pass the biscuits! I finally have an actor to dress. 
Hello, Mr. Shiner. 
MIKE How're you doing, Larry? 
LARRY Better, now that you're here. 
Take off your clothes. (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 23. 
Mike takes off his shirt and hands it to Sam. 
She doesn't budge, and it hits the floor. 
He begins to unbutton his pants... 
MIKE You gonna stand there? 
SAM (Glancing at her cell.) This is the theatre, honey. 
Don't be so self-conscious. 
Larry searches for a few costume pieces. 
LARRY Okay. 
I'm gonna have to start from scratch, with less than twenty-four hours... 
Let's see if these-- He turns to see a completely naked Mike. 
LARRY (CONT'D) Holy-- What is happening? 
Where are your underpants? 
MIKE At home, under the bed, I think. 
Sam glances at Mike for a second, then returns to her phone. 
Larry begins to help Mike into some pants which, given the situation, is very awkward. 
LARRY Okay. 
Everything is too small. 
SAM Yeah, you're not kidding. 
Lesley enters the room immediately coming face to face with a naked Mike. 
She doesn't notice Sam who is partially hidden by a clothes rack. 
She just goes about trying a costume shirt. 
LESLEY Oh, that's nice... (To Larry.) Forgive him, Larry. 
Mike's like my five year old son. 
Neither one of them has clean underwear... 
LARRY Or pubic hair, I imagine. (Folding the pants.) Okay, well, I can take out the suit but we're going to need some new pants and shirts. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 24. 
LARRY (CONT'D) (Looking back.) And underwear... 
Mike just stands there naked, staring at his penis in the mirror. 
LESLEY (To Larry.) This is too small. (To Mike.) What the hell are you doing? 
MIKE Waiting for Larry to finish. 
LARRY I'm finished. 
Larry disappears deeper into the costume room. 
MIKE Okay, well, then I'm just standing here with my balls out. 
LESLEY Get dressed. 
Riggan's daughter is hanging around, and I don't need her to walk in here and-- MIKE Leslie... 
LESLEY No, Mike. 
You haven't seen her. 
She's always hanging around, just-- I don't-- Watching everyone. 
It's creepy. 
It's-- MIKE Les... 
LESLEY I don't know if the drugs fried her brain or what, but I don't need her running to her father saying you showed her your junk. 
MIKE Okay, then we should probably get her out of here. 
Lesley's expression goes blank. 
LESLEY Oh, God. 
Really? (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 25. 
MIKE Hey, Sammy... 
SAM It's Sam. 
LESLEY Fuck. 
Sam steps forward. 
LESLEY (CONT'D) (To Sam.) I didn't mean-- SAM (Totally relaxed.) It's cool. 
He's a handful, huh? 
They both look back at Mike. 
LESLEY Almost. 
Sam smiles at her and exits. 
Lesley wheels on Mike. 
LESLEY (CONT'D) Jesus... 
How is it you always manage to find a new way to humiliate me? 
MIKE To be fair, you make it really easy. 
LESLEY What the hell was she doing here? 
MIKE She brought me. 
LESLEY And stayed??? 
MIKE I know, right? 
She's a little-- LESLEY Look at me, Mike. 
This is Broadway. 
I'm here. 
Finally. 
And I'm begging you, if you love me, please, do me a favor... don't fuck it up. 
MIKE (Gently.) Come here. (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 26. 
Lesley moves toward Mike. 
He cups her face in his hands tenderly. 
They are face to face. 
MIKE (CONT'D) Play with my balls... 
She twists his nipples hard and walks out. 
MIKE (CONT'D) I won't fuck it up... 
Probably! Larry reappears holding some clothes. 
We follow him out... 10 INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 10 ...through the hallway. 
He walks by Jake and Riggan who are mid conversation. 
We stay with them. 
RIGGAN (O.S.) I don't care, sign it. 
JAKE (O.S.) Listen to me. 
RIGGAN (O.S.) No you listen to me-- JAKE (O.S.) I can't afford to listen to you... 
LARRY I'm gonna need to go shopping again. 
JAKE Fucking sew something, you old fuck! RIGGAN I don't care. 
Give him what he wants. 
JAKE His agent is asking for almost four times what we were paying-- RIGGAN Then go into the reserve. 
JAKE The reserve is gone. 
You spent it on the fog. 
And those fake trees... (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 27. 
RIGGAN It's a dream sequence, it-- JAKE And three union midgets that dance around like-- RIGGAN You're not supposed to call them midgets-- JAKE The reserve is gone! RIGGAN Listen to me, you didn't see what I just saw. 
But you will, at the preview tomorrow. 
Look, get the contract done. 
I'll get the money. 
Riggan begins marching toward the stage. 
JAKE (Calling after him.) When??? 
Laura comes down some stairs and chases Riggan. 
LAURA (Incredulous.) Hey, is it true? 
Shiner? 
RIGGAN He's in. 
LAURA Holy shit! When can I meet him? 
RIGGAN He's in a fitting with Larry. 
Lesley comes down the hallway. 
LESLEY I'm going to Starbucks. 
You guys want anything? 
RIGGAN I'm fine. 
How's Mike? 
LESLEY Did you talk to your daughter? 
RIGGAN No. (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 28. 
LESLEY He's great. 
LAURA (To Lesley. 
Matter-of- factly.) Honey, your tits look like fucking anjou pears in that top! LESLEY (Uncomfortable.) Okay, well I'm gonna-- Thank you. 
She walks away. 
LAURA And that ass. 
Like two eggs in a hanky! A10 A10 Riggan walks, Laura follows him. 
LAURA Okay, I was going to tell you this over dinner, but everything-- I have some news too. 
RIGGAN Good or bad? 
Cause right now-- A technician walks by. 
LAURA (Whispering.) I missed my last two periods. (Beat.) I think it's happening this time. 
Riggan stops. 
Silent. 
A beat. 
LAURA (CONT'D) Is that good or bad? (He stares at her.) Riggan...? 
RIGGAN It's good. 
It's great. 
She smiles, her eyes filled with emotion. 
Riggan smiles back, and nods absently. 
LAURA Say something else... (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 29. 
RIGGAN (Joking.) You're pretty sure it's mine? 
LAURA (Unamused but plays along) Well, let's see. 
There's you. 
Jake. 
That masseuse wore a condom so... 
Yes, it's yours... idiot. 
She puts her head on Riggan's chest. 
We see his mind racing. 
Laura is moved, and confused. 
LAURA (CONT'D) Are you excited? 
RIGGAN Yeah. 
LAURA Me too. 
Laura moves slightly away from him and suddenly slaps him across the face. 
Riggan looks at her, confused. 
RIGGAN What--? 
LAURA You're not funny. 
She kisses him intensely on the lips and briefly places his hand on her belly, then moves it up to her breasts. 
After a moment, she backs away. 
LAURA (CONT'D) First preview tomorrow. 
Here we go! Laura turns and walks away. 
Riggan continues down the corridor. 
He passes by a Security Guard· in front of a small TV. The camera becomes Riggan's POV and advances until... 11 INT. BACKSTAGE - THEATER - EVENING 11 ...we go through the stage door. 
We scan the backstage area to see the stagehands ready to do their jobs. 
We can feel the electricity of a first preview. 
On stage part of the kitchen set from before is visible. 
Annie stands at her podium, calling the cues for the show. 
ANNIE (Into her headset.) Cue 34 and 35. 
Go. (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 30. 
She turns and looks directly into the camera. 
ANNIE (CONT'D) Places. 
RIGGAN (O.S.) Okay. 
Riggan walks on screen wearing his costume, carrying a bucket of ice and a bottle of gin. 
He goes to the opposite side of the stage and takes his place in the wings. 
He peeks out at the audience who seem to be watching with interest. 
Then we pan to the stage to find Mike, Lesley and Laura performing the scene we saw at the beginning, around the table. 
Mike looks comfortable, sipping at his drink. 
A half empty bottle of gin on the table. 
MIKE The maniac shot himself right in front of us. 
I rode with him in the ambulance to the hospital. 
LESLEY I'll never get that image out of my head. 
Right before he did it, his eyes-- they were so sad... lonely. 
LAURA Did you have to treat him? 
MIKE I didn't have to. 
But I did. (Pouring another drink.) He was in bad shape. 
His head swelled up to like twice the size of a normal head. 
I'd never seen anything like it. 
And I swear to God, I hope I never do again. 
Riggan stands near Annie. 
RIGGAN He's good. 
ANNIE He's incredible. 
I think he's drinking real gin. 
Riggan looks out at Mike, who is refilling his glass. 
RIGGAN What? (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 31. 
A stagehand gives Riggan a bottle. 
Riggan watches and waits for his cue. 
MIKE Ask Nick what real love is. 
He'll agree with me. 
You watch. 
LESLEY Why don't we just head to the restaurant? 
LAURA Don't get him started, Mel. 
You haven't seen how he's been lately. 
He's been depressed. 
I'm worried about him. 
He's been-- She gently pushes Riggan and we follow him on stage... 12 INT. STAGE - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 12 ...where Mike goes to refill his glass with the last of the real gin. 
Riggan snatches the bottle out of his hands and gulps the rest, straight from the bottle. 
RIGGAN Been what? (Beat.) I'll tell you what real love is. 
This happened a few months ago. (Drops bottle on table) And it ought to make us ashamed when we talk like we know what we're talking about when we talk about love. 
LAURA Nick, for God's sake. 
Are you getting drunk? 
RIGGAN (Pointed at Mike.) I don't have to be drunk to say what I think. 
MIKE Nobody's drunk. 
We're just having a few drinks. 
LESLEY You've had more than a few. 
RIGGAN What are you, counting? (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 32. 
LAURA Don't you talk to her like that. 
Don't talk like a drunk if you're not-- RIGGAN (Exploding.) Shut up. 
For once in your life. 
Will you do me a favor and shut up for a minute? (Beat.) Like I was saying... 
There's this old couple, had a car wreck out on the interstate. 
Some drunk kid plowed his dad's pick up into their camper. 
We begin to hear the underscoring of violins. 
RIGGAN (CONT'D) Fucking teenager. 
By the time I got to the hospital, the kid was dead. 
He was off in a corner laid out on a gurney. 
We took the old couple up to the O.R.. They were a mess. 
We worked like hell on them for most of the night... 
Over the speech, Mike reaches for the new bottle that Riggan placed on stage. 
He refills his glass. 
RIGGAN (CONT'D) When we were done, we wrapped them in full body casts. 
The husband was depressed. 
Even when I told him his wife was gonna pull through, he was still depressed. 
So, I got up to his mouth hole and asked him, and he told me it was because he couldn't see her through the eye holes. 
Can you imagine? 
I'm telling you, the man's heart was breaking because he couldn't turn his goddamn head and see his goddamn wife. 
Riggan is doing a good job. 
Lesley and Laura are genuinely moved. 
Mike notices. 
He sips his drink. 
RIGGAN (CONT'D) I mean... 
It was killing him. 
Killing him that he-- MIKE I'm tired of this shit. 
They all look at Mike. 
In silence. (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 33. 
MIKE (CONT'D) (to Riggan) What the fuck is this? 
Water? 
He hurls the glass against the wall. 
Some laughter from the audience. 
Riggan stares at him, confused. 
He presses on. 
RIGGAN It was killing the old bastard... 
MIKE Did you just give me water? 
RIGGAN Come on, Mike. 
MIKE Come on what? 
RIGGAN Take it easy. 
You're drunk. 
MIKE Of course I'm drunk! I'm supposed to be drunk! This is Carver, man! The guy lost a piece of liver every time he wrote a page! If I'm supposed to drink gin then bring me fuckin gin! I mean, you fucked the time period! You took all the good lines for yourself! At least let me-- The audience is now hysterical. 
Dozens of cell phones pointing at the stage. 
Mike walks toward the apron, facing the audience. 
MIKE (CONT'D) Oh, okay. 
Seriously? 
You people are pathetic. 
Put the cell phones down and join the real world! Will somebody please just live in the real world?!! He crosses to the refrigerator. 
LAURA Where's he going? 
LESLEY (Firmly.) Mike, cut it out. 
Mike rummages through the fridge. (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 34. 
MIKE Look at this. 
It's all fake. (Tossing items out of the fridge.) The milk is fake. 
The butter is fake. 
Riggan storms off the stage. 
MIKE (CONT'D) (To Riggan.) Your performance is fake. (He finds some fried chicken.) Hey! There's chicken. 
Real chicken. 
The only thing real up here is the chicken. 
So I'm gonna stick with the chicken. 
The audience laughs harder. 
MIKE (O.S.) (CONT'D) Hey, this is good bird, man! Riggan charges through the chaos backstage running into a panicked Annie. 
RIGGAN Get Mike out of here. 
ANNIE How do you want me to do that? 
Riggan keeps walking up to... 13 INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 13 ...the hallway. 
Jake chases him. 
RIGGAN I want him gone. 
JAKE No. RIGGAN What? 
JAKE We can't do that. 
RIGGAN What are you-- Of course we can do that. 
It's our show. (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 35. 
JAKE Riggan, listen to me-- Riggan comes to a halt and faces Jake. 
RIGGAN No. You listen to me. 
Get him the fuck out of my play. 
Did you see him out there? 
JAKE It was a preview! Nobody gives a shit about previews. 
Nothing matters until that old bat from the New York Times is sitting in that audience on opening night. 
RIGGAN We're getting rid of him. 
I'm not going to stand up on that stage and-- JAKE Shut up! Just shut up for once and listen to me. 
As soon as we announced he was taking over, the advance doubled. 
We can't afford to lose a preview. 
We can't afford to lose money. 
We can't afford to lose Mike. 
This is about being respected, validated, remember? 
That's what you told me. 
That's how you got me into this shit. 
Now, you're the director. 
Get him under control. (A beat. 
As a friend.) These are not the nineties anymore. 
Jake storms away. 
Riggan heads toward his dressing room. 
Out of nowhere, Mike barrels into him, pinning him against a wall. 
RIGGAN (Startled.) Holy Fuck! Mike presses up against Riggan, breathing down his neck. 
After a painful silence... 
MIKE (Like he's possessed.) You were good... 
RIGGAN Meet me in front of the theater in 10 minutes. 
Mike chuckles and slaps Riggan gently on the face before he disappears into his dressing room. 
Riggan begins walking again. 
We follow him into... 10/29/14 / 36. 14 INT. RIGGAN'S DRESSING ROOM - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 14 ...his dressing room. 
He goes into the bathroom and quickly washes his face. 
SYLVIA (O.S.) What the hell was going on up there? 
We pan over to see his ex-wife Sylvia (43), standing in one corner, staring at Riggan. 
She is elegant and simply beautiful. 
RIGGAN I didn't know you were here tonight. 
SYLVIA That guy's an asshole, huh? 
Riggan dries his hands with a towel and comes out of the bathroom. 
RIGGAN What are you doing here? 
SYLVIA Sam and I are going to grab a bite after she's finished with-- RIGGAN No, I mean here. 
Now. 
SYLVIA Well. 
I know how much this means to you, so-- RIGGAN I appreciate that. 
A beat. 
SYLVIA So, how's it going? 
RIGGAN The play? 
SYLVIA No, you and Sam. 
RIGGAN It's good. (A beat.) It's the same. 
SYLVIA Do you talk to her? (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 37. 
RIGGAN We talk. 
We-- I don't know, it's been crazy around here. 
SYLVIA You understand where her head is at right now. 
RIGGAN Of course. 
SYLVIA She's trying to stay away from everything and everyone that got her into rehab in the first place, but... 
RIGGAN ...I know, Sylvia... 
SYLVIA ...But that's all she had. 
So she's-- RIGGAN I really do get it. 
SYLVIA I know you're caught up in all this stuff, but-- RIGGAN Stuff... 
SYLVIA You know what I mean. (Beat.) Riggan... 
You don't have to be a great father right now, you just have to be one. 
RIGGAN Yeah. 
Suddenly, Laura opens the door and sticks her head in. 
LAURA (Noticing Sylvia.) Oh, sorry. 
She closes the door. 
Awkward silence. 
SYLVIA So how is that going? 
Is she and Sam--? 
RIGGAN I don't wanna talk about it. (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 38. 
He goes to a small fridge, takes out a beer and closes it. 
SYLVIA You're drinking? 
RIGGAN I'm having a beer. 
SYLVIA Okay... 
He sits and sips in silence for a moment. 
Then he begins to take out the wig. 
RIGGAN So, what's going on with you? 
SYLVIA Me? Nothing. 
Everything's the same I guess. 
I'm going back to teaching. 
RIGGAN I'm thinking about refinancing the Malibu house. 
SYLVIA Wh-- I'm sorry? 
RIGGAN I'm thinking about-- SYLVIA No, I heard you. 
I just need a second to-- (A beat.) That's gonna be Sam's house. 
Why would you-- (A beat.) What? 
For this play? 
RIGGAN (Honest and vulnerable.) I need the money. 
SYLVIA Do you have any idea how crazy that sounds? 
RIGGAN What do you want me to say? 
My health lasted longer than the money... 
Go figure that out. 
Riggan seems pensive and lost. 
SYLVIA Riggan... (Beat.) What's going on?... 
Look at me. (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 39. 
Riggan gently looks up to Sylvia. 
RIGGAN I have a chance to do something right. 
And I have to take it. 
I have to. 
SYLVIA It's funny. 
I was sitting here waiting for you, and all of a sudden I couldn't remember why we broke up. 
Silence. 
Then, as if he hasn't heard what she said. 
RIGGAN The last time I flew here from LA, George Clooney was sitting two seats in front of me. 
With those cuff links, and that... chin. 
We ended up flying through this really bad storm. 
The plane started to rattle and shake, and everyone on board was crying... and praying. 
And I just sat there-- Sat there thinking that when Sam opened that paper it was going to be Clooney's face on the front page. 
Not mine. (A beat.) Did you know that Farrah Fawcett died on the same day as Michael Jackson? 
She smiles sadly. 
She kisses him on the head and goes to the door. 
RIGGAN (CONT'D) Why did we break up? 
SYLVIA (Looks him in the eye.) You threw a kitchen knife at me... 
Riggan is smacked by that memory. 
His eyes on the floor. 
SYLVIA (CONT'D) ...and one hour later you were telling me how much you loved me. (Beat.) Just because I didn't like that ridiculous comedy you did with Goldie Hawn didn't mean I did not love you. 
But that's what you always do. 
You confuse love with admiration. 
She smiles sadly. 
He looks at her. 
As Sylvia opens the door, she turns back to Riggan... (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 40. 
SYLVIA (CONT'D) It's your house, so do what you want with it. 
Just make sure you're there for our daughter. 
RIGGAN I will. 
SYLVIA You're not Farrah Fawcett, Riggan. 
She exits. 
Painful silence... until... 
BIRDMAN (V.O.) We should have done that reality show they offered us. "The Thomsons." That would've been good. 
Crazy, druggy, wise ass daughter. 
Milfy wife with the perky tits. 
People would have watched that. 
RIGGAN (To the poster.) Shut up. 
Riggan stands up and grabs his jacket. 
He opens the door and goes out to... 15 INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 15 ...the hallway. 
BIRDMAN (V.O.) Where are we goin'? 
RIGGAN (Almost whispering.) Leave me alone. 
Riggan walks between crew members. 
Annie interrupts him. 
ANNIE The sun bed is here. 
RIGGAN What does that mean? 
ANNIE It means there's a sun bed out there being delivered to in here. 
RIGGAN Who ordered a sun bed? (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 41. 
ANNIE Mike. 
He says it's for his character. 
Carver's red necks, "people of the land". 
Part of his process and that shit. 
Riggan cannot deal with this right now. 
He continues walking until he arrives at a metal door that takes him out to... 16 EXT. AN ALLEY WAY - OUTSIDE THE THEATER - CONTINUOUS 16 ...an alley way. 
Riggan walks toward the street. 
There is a man playing drums. 
Riggan finds Mike leaning against a parked car, dazed and looking up at the marquis... 
RIGGAN Let's go. 
Walk. 
Riggan begins to walk, Mike follows.
