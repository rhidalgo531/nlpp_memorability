We need to make tracks. 	79300000
ABEL Yes... but if I don't get it... 	79300000

STEVE (CONT'D) General, any of these models available? ,	78800000
BRAND It's game theory. 	78800000
I think it's there for a reason. 	78800000
The mirror is fogged up. 	78700000
He gets himself over to the side of the road. 	78700000
He moves the only thing he can... 	78700000

DU PONT They're dead. 	78000000
Every last one of them trying to have it all. 	77900000

I got something off of it. 	77800000
DU PONT I'm sorry? 	77800000

I tell the facts the way I see them. 	77100000

One problem -- the engine isn't there. 	73000000
And that's the way you want it to be. 	73000000

KANE We can discuss all this some other time, Susan. ,	71700000
REY Finn, what are you talking about? ,	71700000

DU PONT No. No. You should kneel. 	70900000
RALPH How is that-- That is not love and you know it. 	70900000

No one called you that. 	70200000

I'm Chris Kyle. 	68700000
TOURIST GUY Your stuff is cute. 	68600000

Lionel just gets back up again only to be slammed down. 	68400000
I don't have a chance in hell. 	68400000
Impossible for you to break through. 	68400000

Mike's like my five year old son. 	68200000
MARGARET Would you like to go into town? 	68200000
BIGGLES (gargled) I'm got it. 	68100000

COOPER What does that have to do with anything? 	45000000
LAURA Don't get him started, Mel. ,	45000000
I don't want you uncomfortable and trying to change this into something it's not. 	44900000

What are you saying? 	41000000
MIA I made something for you. 	41000000

Close. 	40600000
Here. 	40500000
I don't need savin' by you or nobody else. 	40500000

CHRIS No, sir. (03.18.14) 13. ,	39600000
What if there's something we can salvage? 	39600000
He makes his choice... 	39500000
COOPER No one was listening. 	39400000
He still might show up. 	39400000
This is what I'm doing. 	39400000
When they get back - KANE (sharply) Brad, you are drunk. ,	39200000
The people who knew about this mission probably died years ago. 	39100000

DICK Jesus, not those! I mean the little hobo kids. ,	39000000

We don't even know what they are bringing against us. 	38700000

She's alive, enthused. ,	37400000
DON CORLEONE Can I do something for you still? 	37400000
COOPER What is he doing? 	37300000
He stays and struggles to get the deer out of the road. 	37300000
TONY (looks them over) It's on boys. 	37300000
If they are in the street he will know we have spoken. 	37100000
They both stare out at the court for beat. 	37100000
I have to grab a drink... 	37000000

Now at this point you have not tipped your hat in anyway. 	36600000
CHRIS I'm going to marry you, and we're going to start a family. ,	36600000
Of course, we're different. ,	36600000
A single wind chime. 	36600000
So we can't close on the new property. 	36500000

Glass takes off at a trot. 	35200000
WALTER I knew you'd love it. 16. 	35100000
He isn't just scared anymore. 	35100000
Cooper climbs down, pulls out his bag. ,	35000000
I'm done. 	35000000
If I'd gone to your High School, I'd have had your back. ,	34900000

No, your punishment is that you're out of the family business. ,	33500000
JUDGE How many years back do these go? 	33500000
His eyes are relentlessly upon her. 	33500000

CONTRACTOR That may be true. 	33200000
But it's local. 	33100000
Who's coming? 	33100000
They can't seem to get right. 	33100000
I do... 	33100000
We're working off a new playbook now. 	33100000
That's a warning. 	33100000
It's dead. 	33100000
We took the old couple up to the O.R.. They were a mess. 	33000000
You saved my life. 	33000000
He's simply not here. 	32900000

They both look out for a long, long beat. ,	32700000
RIGGAN Which one? 	32700000
In some, the fox runs one way, in some the other. ,	32700000
You wouldn't like him. 	32600000

WALTER You wanna touch it? 	32500000
SEBASTIAN I'm good. 	32500000
ABEL I would never take this. 	32500000

It's 3 a.m. 	32500000
Please. 	32500000
BIGGLES Whatever, man. ,	32400000

In a dark place. 	32100000

They got work to do. 	30900000
MARGARET You're right... this is paradise. 	30900000
Glass just sits there looking at the map. 	30800000
So what's your point?" MIKE "What's my point?" RIGGAN "What's your point? 	30800000
They feed on them and emit visible light. 	30700000
WALTER What are you working on? 	30700000
ABEL You are thirteen years old. 	30700000

Her face darkens. 	30600000
He gets right up in her face but does not touch her. 	30600000
NSA AGENT Then why is it there? 5. 	30600000
But the girls up at that place are... 	30600000
MIKE Follow me. 	30600000

It was after the War. 	30500000
Everything. 	30500000

I could sign it myself. 	30400000
Dauber shakes his head, he's not going to make it. ,	30400000
GLASS You took everything I had... left me to die. 	30400000
You want me to give you the evidence, Mr. Kane? ,	30400000
Glass walks out. 	30400000
Still nothing from the others. 	30300000
RUSTY Not anymore. 	30300000
ABEL Most people don't have anything beautiful like this to show for their day's work. 	30300000
OUTSIDE A car backfires. 	30200000

Perhaps you'd like to write a letter to the editor. 	28900000
MARK Thank you. 	28800000
CASE I know you won't, Mr. Cooper. ,	28800000

Then. 	20500000
He begins to cry. 	20500000
He barely made it through. 	20500000
Then... 	20500000
Thanks... 	20500000
WOMAN #2 (O.S.) Hi, I'm trying to reach Mia Dolan. ,	20500000
MARK I didn't realize he was married. 	20500000
Not until now. 	20500000
The time: 8:02. 	20500000
WOMAN #2 (O.S.) Ok. If you do talk to her -- SEBASTIAN I won't. 	20400000
HAN You might need this. 	20400000
WOMAN #2 (O.S.) -- She's not answering her cell and I was told I might find her here. 	20400000
SOFIA I don't have to be. 	20400000
But I'm going to write a good story, okay? ,	20400000
Fuck. 	20300000
Then -- SEBASTIAN Your play's incredible. 	20300000
It's not very robust. (looks at Case) No offense. 	20300000
WOMAN #2 (O.S.) -- please tell her Jane at Amy Brandt Casting is trying to reach her. 	20300000
Mark has no idea what that means, but nods his head. ,	20200000
Focus. 	20200000
WAYNE (VO) You know your purpose. 	20200000
Here I am. 	20200000
MICHAEL For dinner. 	20200000
They have passed a little enclosed newsstand. 	20100000
COOPER I was wondering where you've been getting your supplies. 	20100000
TROY Just this month. 	20000000
She tears off the check and hands it to Mark. 	20000000
CHRIS So let's coach them up. 	20000000
The world does not revolve around you! This shuts them up for a beat. 	20000000
Studying the boy's face. 	20000000
LESLIE Did you find another actor? 	20000000
MIA What do we do? 	19900000
It's always been there. 	19900000
She's an hour-and-a-half walk from her place. 	19800000
This is his life. 	19800000
The match is over. 	19800000
TIPSY MAN We got in early. 	19800000
Nineteen. 	19800000
You gave me a very good chance. 	19800000
The DON is silent, stern. ,	19700000
Singing. 	19700000
This comes back to me. 	19700000
She's an hour-and-a-half walk from her place. 	19700000
KANE Do you like poetry, Raymond? ,	19700000
They watch them pass and walk away. 	19700000
COOPER (QUIET) That's why you're looking for a planet with oxygen. 	19700000
Maybe that's part of the plan. 	19600000
Up and down. 	19600000
ABEL I am always trying to expand my business. 	19600000
DON CORLEONE Now go back to the party and leave it to me. 	19600000
Ok, that works. ,	19600000
COOPER I'd say they have a long way to go. 	19600000
Unlike us it doesn't have anywhere to go. 	19500000
The nurses don't hear him. 	19500000
RIGGAN What do you think? 	19500000
EMILY There's a call I want you to make with me, Charles. ,	19500000
Beautiful. 	19500000
LEIA We both did. 	19400000
It just happens to be true. 	19400000
LESLIE Can I talk to you for a second? 	19400000
SEBASTIAN I don't want to meet anyone. 	19400000
And... then, we have to consider future revenue stream. ,	19400000
The door was open. 	19300000
CASE Secure yourselves. 	19300000
MRS. KANE We have to stay here, Charles. ,	19300000
Ok, that works. ,	19300000
ANNA A gun... 	19300000
Nothing would be strong enough to weaken a black hole. 	19200000
Anti. 	19200000
Yes, I did. ,	19200000
MARK Mr. du Pont, I don't... you can't buy Dave. ,	19200000
COOPER How long does this place have? 	19200000
Dark. 	19200000
He would like to rip the phone to pieces in his bare hands. 	19200000
You walk around like you are saving the world but what are you doing... nothing! This stings. 	19200000
Leading. 	19200000
LIONEL You wanted me to drop in and tell you how the story was coming? 	19200000
Sorry. 	19200000
Sure. 	19100000
Really? 	19100000
They speak when they should listen. 	19100000
Disbelief on Mia's face. 	19000000
Him? 	19000000
How haven't we staffed you yet? 	19000000
I guess that's why you ran away from Emily. 	18900000
Really. 	18900000
CHRIS You ever hunt? 	18800000
Loomis's words fall on him like a death sentence. 	18800000
CHRIS MESSAGE (VO Tell the kids I love them. 	18800000

ANNA How did it go? 	18300000
A long beat, then... ,	18300000
A few of the others open more liquor... 	18300000
TAYA (OS) Then come home. 	18300000
Anything. 	18300000

A man. 	18200000
MIKE I don't need the script. 	18200000
TOM The kid doesn't even know what he was named after... 	18200000
Mary... 	18200000
He looks around as ANDREW and ANNA come up next to him. 	18200000
But he doesn't move... not yet. 	18200000
JAKE What do you mean? (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 8. 	18200000

I've seen you in front of a crowd Troy. 	18100000
SUSAN I'm not going to put up with it. 	18100000
Someone. 	18100000
But, am I... mixed-up? ,	18100000
A good actor. 	18100000
Case is right. 	18100000
SONNY enters, climbs two steps at a time. ,	18100000
No major, no affiliations, no solo son. ,	18000000
You know... 	18000000
You know? 	18000000
Maybe some girl? 	18000000
We all just keep our distance. 	18000000
Right now. 	18000000
ABEL Yes, I have. ,	18000000

CHRIS For Biggles. 	17400000
With your campaign and all. 	17400000
Until... 	17400000

He passes Mia's car. 	17300000
Pause. 	17300000
Waiting. 	17200000
DU PONT I did. 	17200000
GABE Hey so...this whole "Head of House" thing. 	17200000

I used to be based on the Left Bank. 	17000000
There's something happening on campus. 	17000000
My mother was there with us... 	16900000
Peace. 	16900000

He takes her by the hand and leads her off. 	16900000
BRAND No... wait. 	16900000
Why are we planning this? 	16900000
It's not like when we were driving. 	16900000

We probably have twenty minutes before the guy finds me. 	16800000
DU PONT Hello. 	16800000
COOPER A little. 	16800000
You were a genius at salesmanship and promotion. 	16800000
Gauging their reactions... 	16800000
Dee-Ann stops, puzzled. ,	16800000

Hm... 	16700000
The OLD MAN nods. 	16700000
She says she can't make it tonight. 	16700000
We can see that she is in her comfort zone. 	16700000
SONNY (calmly) They shot the old man. 	16700000
Sit. 	16600000
He stares at her for a beat. 	16600000

Push `em out. 	12700000
Apparatus. 	12700000
COOPER Why not? 	12700000
But now... 	12700000
Just at the cloth. 	12700000
Peaceful and pretty. 	12700000
Surprised. 	12700000
Phone calls. 	12700000
COOPER Lose time? 	12700000
DON CORLEONE Thank you, Luca, my most valued friend. ,	12700000

COOPER This way. 	12600000
COP 1 Hey. 	12600000
Staring. 	12600000
COOPER Great idea. 	12600000
She catches a SOCIETY MAN's eye, and he hurries over. ,	12600000
Mia snaps out of it. 	12600000
He has a copy of the "Enquirer" in his hand. 	12600000
Protect the Marines. 	12600000
Ralph is just that bad. 	12600000
Cooper looks on. 	12600000
THOMPSON Oh, I don't know. ,	12600000
Going down. 	12600000
How do I look? 	12500000

LAWRENCE Probably not. 	12500000
The casting director. 	12500000
Fuck me. 	12500000
Wynn. 	12500000
There's no sign of their ship in orbit. 	12500000
They look at each other one last time. 	12500000
PRESIDENT FLETCHER Son, call me Herb. ,	12500000
PIG Same here. 	12500000
Lock and load. 	12500000
He falls into it. 	12500000
I am interested in - well, Junior, for one thing. ,	12500000
They both smile. 	12500000
The whole room looks up at them. 	12500000
Walter is surprised. 	12500000
CUT TO: 96. 	12400000
She tingles. 	12400000
Surprised. 	12400000
Try the speech. 	12400000
Mia knew this. 	12400000
LAWRENCE Excuse me? 	12400000
MIKE Okay, then we should probably get her out of here. ,	12400000
The newspapers, for instance. ,	12400000
On your call. 	12400000
LESLEY Fuck. 	12400000
My shift is actually up. 	12400000
No worries about operations, is that what you tell me? ,	12400000
Oh no. 	12400000
Wadded Honolulu newspapers. 	12400000
YOUNG MAN Are you... "Chief" Chris Kyle? 	12400000
Sooner. 	12400000
A challenging smile. 	12400000
How's Jane? 	12400000
Biggles smiles, jealous. ,	12400000
THOMPSON Not much. 	12400000
George can't fight his grin as he looks to Annie. 	12400000
COCO Where's Sofia? 	12300000
CHRIS What the fuck!? 	12300000
DAVE I hadn't seen you yet. 	12300000
We stay here for four images. 	12300000
STUBBY BILL The kid's gone... gear and all. 	12300000
The drill revs. 	12300000
This is personal. 	12300000
DAVE Hey, Coach. ,	12300000
They enter, Emily first. ,	12300000
CUT TO: 73. 	12300000
This is our ritual. 	12300000
You got a break coming up? 	12300000
JUDGE Now, I'm not looking for a masterpiece. ,	12300000
The justice is... 	12300000
He's diddled every skirt on the art circuit. 	12200000
You should know, I'm a big deal in the Resistance. ,	12200000
Not the Legend. 	12200000
INSTRUCTOR ROLLE Don't lie to me! I bet we could use her panties as a parachute. 	12200000
She relents and relaxes. 	12200000
KYLO REN I want that map. 	12200000
Bad things. 	12200000
I'm not a hero. 	12200000
DAVE Whether or not he chooses to stay. 	12200000
She gets to her feet, frightened by what she sees. ,	12200000
LAWRENCE I hear you closed on this terminal today? 	12200000
Heaven on earth. 	12200000
GORDON Kurt it's three. 	12200000
COOPER The blight. 	12200000
And, starting to cry. ,	12200000
ANNA I found a gun outside our front door. 	12200000
SUNGMI Or Immigration. 	12200000
Lovers of money. 	12100000
Maybe a thousand. 	12100000
BACK TO Mia -- who didn't hear what was said. 	12100000
GORDON And golf? 	12100000
Sebastian gets up. 	12100000
PHOTOGRAPHER That's all. 	12100000
I was the daughter. 	12100000
CHRIS They're not-- MARC LEE They are if they believe they are. 	12100000
Just shelf us like that? 	12100000
I have responsibilities. 	12100000
Come home. 	12100000
Susan is sober. 	12100000
ABEL Nowhere easy. 	12100000
Anyone else? 	12100000
For once in your life. 	12100000
Diapers. 	12100000
And another. 	12100000
Got you. 	12100000
To protect you. 	12100000
But I'm not going to race him I'm going to put him out to Stud. 	12100000
Seems recently it's been changed. 	12000000
They're the windows of the soul -- 12. 	12000000
When'd you say he skipped out? 	12000000
It is empty. 	12000000
The cop leaves. 	12000000
BACK TO Mia -- who didn't hear what was said. 	12000000
BRAND (LAUGHING) Relax. 	12000000
Stands to leave. 	12000000
SINGER "I Ran" it is. (to Sebastian) Wanna start us off, piano-man? ,	12000000
I've had a very tiring day and - EMILY It may not be about anything at all. 	12000000
LAURA Are you serious? 	12000000
She crawls back to her chair. 	12000000
Susan is thinking. 	12000000
This is a signal. 	12000000
SUNGMI You're not serious. 	12000000
No, I don't think it explains anything. ,	12000000
The ramp drops. 	12000000
The place is empty. 	12000000
MICHAEL (softly) That's not how Pop would have played it. 	12000000
But they failed. 	12000000
CHRIS They say it'll be over in 6 weeks. 	12000000
KANE (screams louder) I'm going to send you to Sing Sing, Rogers. ,	11900000
BB-8 doesn't like this at all. 	11900000
DON CORLEONE Genco will wait for me. 	11900000
RUBEN Haven't I seen that one before? 	11900000
SUSAN At night? 	11900000
Now Kane stops and smiles. 	11900000
CASE (CALM) The engines don't have enough power to push us back. 	11900000
Mia is taken aback. 	11900000
His face shaved. 	11900000
CUT TO: 63. 	11900000

Threatened. 	11900000
KANE What check? 	11900000
MANAGER On us. 	11900000
SEBASTIAN Good for you. 	11900000
He releases the dog. 	11900000
SEBASTIAN (a beat; then --) ...What do you mean? 	11900000
Brand walks in. 	11800000
Fitzgerald glances around... looks back to that safe. 	11800000
Ah. Very good. 	11800000
Uh, what's that? ,	11800000
The curtain rises. 	11800000
But there are some decisions that you cannot come back from. 	11800000
Sam's phone buzzes. 	11800000
Or Dallas? 	11800000
Why's the door always locked? 42. 	11800000
JULIAN I was scared. 	11800000
This is Broadway. 	11800000
WALTER Well, because... ,	11800000
Philip Seymour Hoffman... 	11800000
He has a dark goatee and his hair looks strangely abundant. 	11700000
I appreciate it. 	11700000
He looks into the last car and sees LOUIS SERVIDIO and just bull rushes him to the ground. 	11700000
The wife. 	11700000
He cups her face in his hands tenderly. 	11700000
GOAT No man. 	11700000
SEBASTIAN So you're happy here? 	11700000
CLARA I know. 	11700000
Sebastian is silent. 	11700000
KANE Mr. President. 	11700000
NERI I'll do this for you; you know I should. 	11700000
Right now-- MAN'S VOICE (OC) Excuse me, sir. ,	11700000
And don't get lost. 	11600000
Can you imagine? 	11600000
CAITLIN (appearing, 27) Why is there a convention in the bathroom? ,	11600000
An ALARM sounds. 	11600000
KATHERINE Yes ... yes... 	11600000
Then he turns back and tackles his son to the ground. 	11600000
Watch for anyone that might've heard that shot. 	11600000
Is he that good? 	11600000
Fog of war. 	11600000
She's too focused on her lines to notice. 	11600000
I don't know, it's exciting... ,	11600000
Every last drop. 	11600000
Maybe the planet. 	11600000
SUSAN How do you want to handle the whole thing - ask questions? 	11600000
Sit down. 	11600000
LAWRENCE No. ABEL You'll find him. 	11600000
The probe CHIRPS. COOPER Well I don't know what the hell it's made of, but I can't crack it open. ,	11600000
LAURA Okay, I was going to tell you this over dinner, but everything-- I have some news too. ,	11600000
LAWRENCE Of course. 	11600000
That - that shabby little girl. 	11600000
Now what happened between you and Sam to make her come after you anyway? 	11500000
He's nuts. 	11500000
Kurt is there. 	11500000
Sit down. 	11500000
GORDON For starters. 	11500000
Abrams & Michael Arndt Based on characters created by George Lucas A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away... ,	11500000
Kane looks up. 	11500000
He is drinking. 	11500000
KANE Thank you. 	11500000
Sebastian is taken aback. 	11500000
KANE It can wait. 	11500000
The moons are vastly different than our own; potato shaped and only one to two miles in circumference, they are hugged in a close embrace with the ice planet, only a few hundred thousand feet from the surface. ,	11500000
ANDREW WALSH Who? 	11500000
Brand looks around, determined. ,	11500000
CAITLIN (appearing, 27) Why is there a convention in the bathroom? ,	11500000
Either you'll be outside or you won't. 	11400000
ABEL We'll use the money... your money. 	11400000
And again. 	11400000
HENRY (O.S.) Step clear, Mr. Bridger. ,	11400000
My name is Mads. 	11400000
She's tired. 	11400000
That's the butler. 	11400000
This is a grave marker. 	11400000
Okay - well, good luck with your season, coach. ,	11400000
She wants to go, but something nags at her. ,	11400000
She hangs up. 	11400000
GEORGE Never know right? 79. 	11400000
ABEL looks around. 	11400000
DRESSED AS HOBOS... 	11400000
Floating in space. 	11400000
BANDUCCI Oh. Thanks, thanks. ,	11400000
ABEL is thinking back on something, or many things. ,	11400000
DU PONT In training. 	11400000
Then they look back at the deer. 	11300000
Say, you might be able to help me. ,	11300000
FINN What--?! Thief? 	11300000
Quit or fired? 	11300000
Riggan releases the door. 	11300000
He starts flying down the stairs at top panic speed. 	11300000
KANE I know. 	11300000
WAYNE It's a deer, son. ,	11300000
BRAND A guess. 	11300000

ASIAN LADY #2 We have something to share with you about the wonderful things that God's Kingdom will do for mankind. 	11200000
Glass looks over in time to see the horse's ears perk up. 	11200000
You heard the Head Coach. 	11200000
He has everything he ever dreamed of. 61. 	11200000
PO TOSH Hold right-four, up-two. ,	11200000
It's a rescue mission. 	11200000

TRACY Look, I know things didn't go well today. ,	11100000
The two look at each other. 	11100000
CHRIS KYLE He left that part out. 	11100000
MRS. ROSE Of course, come in. ,	11100000
His face goes grave. 	11000000
The crew break themselves away from the view and get to work. 	11000000
KANE Hello, Butch! Did you like your old man's speech? ,	11000000
ANNA Did they sign the contract? 	11000000
TRACY (O.S.) What's that? 	11000000
COCO So you want me to start a fight. 	11000000
I'm not proud I wanted him to die, but it's the truth. ,	11000000
BAM! He misses. 	11000000
ABEL What is that? 	11000000
TOM How long do you think it's been up there, Dad? ,	11000000
The Empire. 	11000000
SEBASTIAN I don't want to meet anyone. 	11000000
A small one. 	11000000
She gives him another look. 	11000000
Look around. 	11000000
CUT TO: LATER The three women sit. 	11000000

And you're so funny. 	11000000
I am. 	11000000
KANE Of course. 	11000000
Cooper laughs, glimpsing the outline of a plan. ,	11000000
An awkward silence. 	11000000
A small gathering. 	11000000
Scoop and shoot. 	11000000
Du Pont is at the table. 	11000000
Not even if this thing was gone for thirty years. 	10900000
You belong with us. 	10900000
ANNA This can't continue. 	10900000
ANNA is already in the house talking with NANNY MARIA who's been baby-sitting. 	10900000
They're all ears as they look across to... 	10900000
We have to postpone the preview. 	10900000
Du Pont smiles. 	10900000
Our fund- raiser is four weeks away. 	10900000
He stops his speech. 	10900000
COOPER You really think there's a plan? 	10900000
WALTER Well -- NO! Of course not. 	10900000
Why didn't the "Enquirer" have that this morning? 	10900000
ABEL How much? 	10900000
Can you hear me...? 	10800000
It's a shame we won't get to see it up close. 	10800000
HER POV WALTER If you like this style, I'm working on a few new pieces. ,	10800000
ABEL is exhausted. 	10800000
I can admit that. 	10800000
And a lot of oil. 	10800000
Go to a Young Republican's meeting and bring up Welfare. 	10800000
We've got two spreads of pictures. 	10800000
Another day. 	10800000
ABEL I agree. 	10800000
Ankor Wat, the night the last King died. ,	10800000
Chewie kind of likes you. 	10700000
It doesn't do any of us any good to have this kind of attention brought to us. 	10700000
Poe just glares. 	10700000
LUISA Of course. 	10700000
DU PONT America doesn't respect you. 	10700000
She turns and looks at him. 	10700000
FITZGERALD On foot? 	10700000
No matter what you think of him, Abel doesn't work this way. ,	10700000
This is insane. 	10700000
DOYLE What problem? 	10700000
Roosevelt and such. 	10700000
She points to the old man lying in the bed. 	10700000
I feel blessed. 	10700000
ANNA Good for you. 	10700000
Straightening the pillows. 	10600000
And the first one left a bad taste. 	10600000
The library that once helped set her on her path to acting. 	10600000
He is nervous. 	10600000
You're the one with the gift. (BEAT; HUSHED) Right now there's a shot... 	10600000
ABEL I must? 	10600000
She gestures him in. 	10600000
Fingering her pencil... 	10600000
Mia can't help but laugh. 	10600000
Scans the motherboard. 	10600000
Are you hungry? 	10600000
Let's get to work. 	10500000
He's showing Alex how to change the oil filter. 	10500000
Stumbles out the door. 	10500000
I can admit that. 	10500000
ABEL I will. 	10500000
This is unexpected. 	10500000
This sits unanswered. 19 A.D.A. 	10500000
Finn awkwardly smiles. 	10500000
COLTON No way. 	10500000
JANE But you never see Walter? 	10500000
Leia, I saw our son. ,	10500000
It was some kid. 	10500000
CHRIS I just know. 	10400000
Information begins appearing on the terminal's screen. 	10400000
ANNA I mean it. 	10400000
This is an honorable institution. 	10400000
He chugs his glass. 	10400000
ABEL To grow. 	10400000
Twenty-one. 	10400000
A deadly silence. 	10400000
Mia is left standing on her own. 	10400000
How much? 91. 	10400000
Du Pont enters. 	10400000
Baby, when you look at me like that, I could fall hard. ,	10400000
What a nightmare... 	10400000
WALTER Sure! Why not? 	10400000
Leland doesn't look up at him. 	10400000
A little girl. 	10400000
TOM What about the tire? 	10300000
Even when you're here you're not here. 	10300000
They stare at each other, then the truck. ,	10300000
Waits. 	10300000
CHRIS (snaps-to; to Colton) Get off the floor. 	10300000
DAUBER Country is countrywide, sir. ,	10300000

Lawrence needs him. 	10300000
Leland is surprised. 	10300000
Jean du Pont. 	10300000
I want to meet him. 	10300000
Mia is left standing on her own. 	10300000
He SINGS. He has a beautiful voice. 	10300000
The door blows off. 	10300000
Just try to imagine that. 	10300000
REGGIE This shit. 	10300000
A bit weathered. 	10300000
How can you? 	10300000
CARTER There is no news big enough. 	10300000
LELAND Why not? 	10300000
The Singer walks off. 	10200000
Sebastian steps in. 	10200000
Stabbed. 	10200000
ROTH Look at that. 	10200000
Shocked. 	10200000
SARAH What the fuck is wrong with you! What'd you expect? 	10200000
I thought-- TAYA He didn't get in. 	10200000
Spit it out. 	10200000
She's pleased. 	10200000
We feel shame. 	10200000
Finally he stops. 	10200000
LELAND He married for love - (a little laugh) That's why he did everything. 	10200000
He's an Avenger. 	10200000
Virgil quickly snatches them back... 	10200000
I have to be a little drunk for that because I'm a coward. 	10200000
DU PONT Just some of the older ones. 	10200000
She's a dignitary. 	10200000
Sees the Valet. 	10200000
ABEL Do we even need to be doing this? 	10200000
VAN ROARS up the turning lane. 	10200000
You in one piece? 	10200000
He stops, looks. ,	10200000
They walk away. 	10200000
ABEL A lot. 	10200000
Because if it had we'd all be dead by now. 	10200000
MARGARET I don't want you sleeping in this room any longer. 	10100000

ANNA Because they are. 	10100000
CHRIS Yes I do. 	10100000
WALTER Teach me. (BEAT) Show me your tricks. 	10100000

Not alone. 	10100000
Sebastian steps in. 	10100000
A cab has pulled up. 	10100000
The Singer walks off. 	10100000
That's why I asked. 	10100000
An awkward pause. 	10100000
ABEL A toast. 	10100000
Mia can't help but laugh. 	10100000
CHRIS Is it Mustafa? 	10100000
The RUMBLE grows. 	10000000
COOPER I've got you. 	10000000
SUSAN On the chiffonier. 	10000000
She's not surprised. 	10000000
You'd never have made Chief if I nicknamed you "The Myth". 	10000000
Riggan gives Jake a look. 	10000000
One eyebrow raised. 	10000000
She's drawing. 	10000000
MIA People will want to go to it! People love what other people are passionate about. 	10000000
Sweating. 	9990000
How are things? 	9990000
Again and again. 	9980000
MURPH But what if there is, dad? ,	9980000

I'll see you. 	9930000
CHRIS I can hunt. 	9930000
Shangri-la? 	9920000
The two look at each other. 	9920000
They're running wild. 	9920000
I know it. 	9910000
But they just need to show that they are defending themselves, and this will stop. ,	9910000
But they just need to show that they are defending themselves, and this will stop. ,	9910000
BACK TO SCENE 27. 	9900000
ANNA What does that mean you will take care of it. 	9890000
It is Susie. 	9890000
One, two, three seconds later. ,	9890000

Leland comes in. 	9860000
I saw him. 	9850000
MARGARET What? (CONFUSED; BEAT) Oh -- you mean Lily! No, she doesn't really live with us. ,	9830000
He looks over in the other mirror and there is THUG #2 walking up. 	9830000
And -- Walter is taken aback. 	9810000
For the bear. 	9800000
KURT Your son tell you that? 	9800000
Bernstein joins him. 	9800000
They're just... blank. 	9790000
Shoots a Trooper. 	9790000
Can you confirm? 	9780000
They're both naked. 	9780000
I'm The Legend. (laughs at self; into phone) Hey babe-- TAYA (OS) You were right, doctor says it's a boy. ,	9770000

Is this going to make you safe? 	9700000
ANDREW WALSH He wants to talk to them. 	9700000

A beat. 	9650000
Green-light. 	9640000
He's made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them. 	9640000
KANE No. But you're close. 	9640000
A beat. 	9640000
LESLEY And stayed??? 	9630000
A beat. 	9630000
And that's all Pig can stand... he TACKLES FITZGERALD... they roll to the ground. 	9620000
A beat. 	9620000
A beat. 	9610000
He looks at his crew who laugh at him. 	9610000
BERNSTEIN So then, tonight, we go over everything thoroughly, eh? ,	9600000
GLASS Middle of workin' on it. 	9590000
He looks up: the tree is venting steam. 	9590000
Would you be willing to take a look. 	9590000
What to do?? 	9580000
There is a silence. 	9580000
Now just get out there and do what you were born to do. 	9570000
Woeful Keane kids. 	9560000
Why should it matter now? 	9560000
How was the flight? 	9550000
It's different. 	9550000
A beat. 	9550000
MIA Why what? 	9530000
SEBASTIAN That's it? 	9530000
That means you all are stealing from each other. 	9530000
Most of it, anyway. ,	9520000
A tiny reading -- non-lethal. 	9520000
Only you're going to need more than one lesson. 	9510000
You're the public face of Foxcatcher. 	9500000
CATHERINE It was just sitting right here. 	9500000
Takes a moment. 	9500000
There is a pause. 	9480000
SUSAN (glares at him balefully) What do you mean? 	9480000
CUT TO: 30. 	9480000
MIKE Nobody's drunk. 	9470000
But he can't leave his boys behind. 	9450000
Takes a moment. 	9450000
Takes a moment. 	9440000
THE CAPTAIN Rosebud? 	9440000
Mia looks up. 	9430000
Takes it in. 	9430000
Her mask is also broken. 	9430000
The couple smile. 	9430000

She turns off the vent. 	9380000
MARGARET No, please! Walter, it's -- personal. 49. ,	9370000
DON CORLEONE Then the picture will wait for him. 	9360000
SEBASTIAN (not listening to her) What am I supposed to do? 	9360000
At least until we know what we're dealing with. 	9350000
All the time. 	9350000
It totally misses THUG #2. 	9350000
But please know that I have always chosen the path that was the most right. 	9350000
Walter calms himself, contrite. ,	9350000
He grabs a mike. 	9340000
SAM I don't know. 	9340000
It has to be good. 	9340000
LIONEL I don't know... 	9330000
They get led in. 	9330000
LIONEL I don't know. 	9330000
Cooper looks down -- a great fissure has opened in the ice beneath them. 	9330000
They know each other. 	9310000
So they beat her like an animal. 	9290000
MIA'S DAD Never. 	9290000
Night should be falling soon. 	9290000
A moment passes. 	9290000
They won't be able to fight it for long. 	9280000
I wish I were a little boy and going to make a trip like that for the first time. 	9280000
Swallows the pill. 	9280000
ABEL is keeping up with him and in fact may be gaining on him. 	9270000
All of you. 	9260000

LUISA I don't know? 	9230000
She's an hour-and-a-half walk from her place. 	9230000
KANE Don't you realize that everybody here is going to know about this? 	9220000
DU PONT ... 	9220000
The other GUARD opens up the back of the truck. 	9210000
Mark doesn't acknowledge him. 	9200000
A clock ticks. 	9200000
DISSOLVE TO: 14. 	9200000

She turns back from the glass. 	9190000
She turns off the vent. 	9190000
ALEXIS Same here. 	9180000
He doesn't see it. 	9170000
COCO For shooting? 	9150000
He doesn't move. 	9150000
He looks in each room and the CHILD is sleeping soundly with nothing out of place. 	9120000
Prints are smooth. 	9110000
HOLD on Rey. 	9110000
A moment passes. 	9090000
Please sing. 	9070000
SUNGMI Black Student Union. 	9060000
The other men all drop their heads... except for Fitzgerald... he's ready to see this end. 	9050000
No one moves. 	9050000
He holds her put. 	9040000
HENRY Do it. 	9030000
She badly wants to give him the answer he wants. 	9020000
LAURA I think so. 	9000000
Who's in? 	8990000
Brand takes it in. 	8980000
Anything to drink? 	8970000
SOLLOZZO takes a breath. 	8960000
Sebastian sits up. 	8960000
Things have been so smooth the last ten years... 	8950000
I reward accomplishment. 	8950000
BRAND These organisms have no interest in us. 	8940000
Nothing else? 	8930000
I am not... 	8900000
Good deal. 	8900000
MIA I guess. 	8900000
Welcome to Philadelphia. 	8880000
Mia knew this. 	8880000
BRAND (RADIO) The probe was right. 	8880000
PIG Found it, Cap. ,	8880000
COOPER Who are you people? 	8880000
LESLEY I can call him and find out. 	8870000
She cracks the cookie. 	8870000
MIA I can. 	8850000
He shows the paper to her. 	8850000
After a brief light moment the cloud comes back over him. 	8840000
But now I've sent for them just the same. 	8830000
FINN Not anymore. 	8820000
You don't belong here. 	8820000
The radio crackles to life. 	8820000
You remember Sofia? 	8810000
Congrats? 	8810000
Would you like a postponement, in order to get your affairs in order? ,	8800000
All the posters and everything. 	8800000
He glowers. 	8800000
CHRIS We don't even have proof this guy exists. 	8800000
He just stands there, like a chastened schoolboy, his face reddening. ,	8790000
HENRY (TO MURPHY) Go clear out a room. 	8790000
Hang on. 	8790000
SEBASTIAN It's beautiful. 	8790000
Spying. 	8780000
For a moment. 	8780000
Thatcher. 	8770000

Good deal. 	8760000
Good deal. 	8750000
CLOSE ON Sebastian. 	8730000
A little blood flows. 	8730000
Mia knew this. 	8720000
MARGARET I just wanted credit for what I had done. 	8720000
COOPER They never landed. 	8710000
The comms are just noise. 	8710000
I just know I'm supposed to charge extra for extra meat. 	8710000
Sam glances at Mike for a second, then returns to her phone. ,	8710000
Starts to marshal his breath. 	8700000
So I ran. 	8700000
SEBASTIAN ...Excuse me? 	8700000
Harry rejoins the table. 	8690000
RALPH Ask her what he did after she left him. 	8690000
You know what would be fun? 	8690000
U.S.A...." 	8680000
Fire and dirt engulf them. 	8680000
Margaret sits up. 	8680000
Thank God. 13. 	8670000
FINN Do it. 	8660000
Nervous, and alone... ,	8660000
He has no idea what to say. 	8660000
On the job? 	8660000
Then you took down the sister with the little radio show. 	8660000
I have hopes for you. 	8640000
NOSY GUY So where do you get your ideas? 	8630000
Two words. 	8630000
Someone to help out. 	8630000
MARGARET Well, every one except that street scene. (BEAT) But I did the rest. ,	8620000
KAY Yes. 	8620000

And that's never easy. 	8600000
LATER Walter finally paints. 	8600000
A.D.A. 	8600000
Sebastian is still. 	8590000
She doesn't know what to say. 	8570000
Everything is too small. 	8570000
Sebastian is confused. 	8560000
Hands in the air. 	8550000
CHRIS (uncertain) I don't know... 	8550000
In total crisis... 	8550000
COOPER (SMILES) I don't know. 	8550000

Considers. 	8540000
THOMPSON No, I didn't. ,	8540000
REILLY Mr. Leland sent back that check. 	8540000
The nurse, unwilling, leaves. ,	8530000
Then -- she starts MOVING down the lane. 	8530000
MARC LEE Clear. 	8520000
MARC LEE Negative. 	8520000
Banks got no money. 	8520000
MARC LEE Six? 	8520000
MARC LEE They're Marines. 	8520000
He is making a difficult right turn to get onto the 59th Street Bridge. 	8520000

Then -- she starts MOVING down the lane. 	8480000
Susan looks at him. 	8470000
Then the old man shifts in his chair. 	8470000
Looks at Keith. 	8460000
Where's Rey? 	8460000

We recognize it. 	8440000
She moves hers. 	8440000
But I know. 	8440000
DAVE What's that? 	8440000
Finally, Glass shoves the man off the back of the horse. ,Trapper #1 tumbles into the snow. ,	8440000
TRAPPER #1 And my shooter. 	8440000
Present tense ho!" Right in the gut. 	8440000
Finn is confused. 	8430000
It is eerily empty. 	8420000
WALTER Is he here? 	8420000
It doesn't. 	8410000
Pretty good. 	8400000
You are my guest but please tell the others to come inside. 	8390000
DEAN FAIRBANKS What? 	8390000
A paragraph has been typed. 	8380000
The foot of Kane's bed. 	8370000
Why do you paint those? 	8360000
Biggles is coughing. 	8360000
WALTER ON THE PHONE - WOODSIDE He is strangely controlled and forboding. 	8360000
TRAPPER #2 I can't get a clear look. 	8350000
CHRIS (into phone) Yeah, I got out early. ,	8350000
LESLEY No. (A beat.) Okay, well, he did beat me up one night. ,	8340000
Her lights pick out something in the ice. 	8340000
Henry turns... walks over to Fitzgerald and Stubby Bill. 	8340000
Laura looks at Mia. 	8330000
JUST THE NIGHT SKY THROUGH THOSE BRANCHES... 	8330000
COOPER Almost got it. 	8330000
It doesn't. 	8320000
KANE You mustn't go, Susan. ,	8320000
A train of dust plumes behind it. 	8310000
MIA Come to Boise? 	8310000
Cost twenty-three thousand. 	8310000
They'll be back. 	8300000
Brand's eyes widen. 	8300000
There is a short silence. 	8300000
Trapper #1 nods to Fitzgerald. 	8300000
And you don't ask in respect or friendship. 	8290000
WALTER YEAH YEAH! Point taken. 	8280000
Sebastian is silent. 	8280000
TRAPPER #1 Then from where I stand, you don't got no friends at all. ,	8280000
TRAPPER #2 It's cold as hell, Cees. ,	8280000
I want you to talk Sonny into it. 	8270000

CHRIS KYLE It's a boy! MARC LEE Hell yeah. 	8260000

It is now dark outside. 	8240000
KANE (as car starts to drive off) What's this all about, Emily? ,	8240000
Margaret glances in a mirror. 	8230000
I am having my daughter's birthday party. 	8230000
He didn't think this through. 41. 	8230000
I appreciate this. 	8230000
TROY I was beloved. ,Won't lie. ,	8220000
An awkward silence. 	8210000
Where are they? 	8210000
The log says the base has been here for thirty years. 	8200000
SEBASTIAN You're not gonna find a better player. 	8190000
Why don't you hop in? 	8190000
Sebastian is silent. 	8180000
Who is this? 	8170000
Good luck. 	8170000
Sebastian is silent. 	8170000
But there are great numbers of candidates. 	8170000
A LOW RUMBLING SOUND. Cooper looks out over the river. 	8170000
It suits you. 	8140000
This is just what's on his mind. 	8140000
Mia is silent. 	8120000
Taking off... 	8120000
He starts typing again, the expression on his face doesn't change. ,	8120000
Me too. 	8120000
LELAND (good naturedly) You're in a conspiracy against me, you two. ,	8120000
The voices fade. 	8100000
A line she can't cross. 	8100000
Most of it is crap. 	8100000
Rocky Mountain Fur Company wants him too. 	8080000
Don't tell me. 	8070000
I like my drivers to fit in with the neighborhood... 	8060000
They give each other a slight smile. 	8040000
Twenty years. 	8040000
RIGGAN She's my assistant. 	8040000
He whirls and looks around. 	8040000
If he does the right thing I will help to take care of his responsibilities. 	8030000
Everyone gets quiet. 	8020000
KANE It's not funny. 	8020000
Don't tell me. 	8020000
After a moment, it's gone. ,	8020000
SEBASTIAN You're not gonna find a better player. 	8020000
Lionel gingerly approaches the door to see George finish up a phone call. 	8020000
I get it. 	8010000
TAYA Aren't you and Chad going to the range? 	8010000
I can admit that. 	8010000
EMILY What story, Mr. Rogers? ,	8010000
EXT. POOL -- NIGHT Brand surfaces first. 	7990000
Roth looks up from his screen, smiling. ,	7990000
One eyebrow raised. 	7990000
HAGEN It's from Johnny. 	7980000
He's given up fighting this fight. 	7980000
Look from where I'm sitting this place is a goldmine. 	7980000
Intense and rough. 	7980000
I love fighting a good battle but this... it's very bad for my business. 	7980000
JANE Take the bed. 	7980000
He can breathe. 	7980000
He is losing it from all the pressure but his daughter bears the brunt. 	7960000
Or New York? 	7960000
You're not going to keep on running my life the way you want it. 	7940000
ABEL No. JOSEPH Why not? 	7940000
Why don't you go? 	7940000
Walter works the room. 	7930000
Then he looks towards the ground and almost looks like he might cry. 	7930000
COCO Don't talk like that. 48. 	7920000
We see it behind his head. 	7910000
Whether that gets us to Union or not... 	7910000
As a company. 	7910000
One eyebrow raised. 	7900000
Besides, they tell me there isn't a decent restaurant on the whole island. ,	7890000
SEBASTIAN You're not gonna find a better player. 	7890000
Cooper is still laughing. 	7890000
Yep, still closed. ,	7890000
COOPER What is this? 	7880000
MICHAEL As long as I tell him beforehand he won't object. 	7880000
Six years of "no" in L.A. have toughened her, but she's still a dreamer. ,	7880000
Looks out his window. 	7880000
We linger on Sebastian. 	7870000
Pulls out a drawing. 	7870000
What are you doing? 	7860000
I do. (beat) I just didn't think you did. 	7860000
EXT. PRAIRIE - NIGHT From high above the prairie... 	7860000
JANE Who's that? 	7860000
Turns off the monitor. 	7850000
Suddenly, he explodes. ,	7850000
I didn't realize you wanted him to coach. 	7850000
COOPER Where am I? 	7840000
Hiding from the customers. 	7830000
SEBASTIAN Why won't you come? 	7830000
He has won no awards. 	7820000
Hang on a minute. 	7820000
G, going to French. ,	7810000
Nothing more. 	7810000
Takes a breath. 	7810000
HENRY Can I talk you outta what you're planning? 	7800000
She responds stiffly -- a girl who doesn't see her father too often. 	7800000
BRAND (O.S.) Cooper. 	7790000
Please don't. 	7790000
This is you, Mark. ,	7790000
Try to improve it. 	7790000
Did you get in a fight? 	7780000
He wants you to come down in person anyway. 	7780000
He POUNDS it, crazed. ,	7780000
FITZGERALD Not that you'd hit me if you tried. 	7760000
None of them ever came back. 	7760000
You're good. 	7750000
But never let him know the family's business. 	7750000
Have you ever thought about it? 	7750000
DEBRA You knew, didn't you, John? ,	7740000
Look at him-- GILLESPIE He does look a little retarded. 	7730000
You tell me. 	7730000
AT THE REGISTER - Margaret gazes up. 	7730000
It's a pleasure to meet you in person finally. 	7730000
He looks idiotic. 	7720000
And those guys who let you in. 	7720000
LOUIS SERVIDIO This was it anyway. 	7720000
F-18 RAPTOR THE PILOT flying into the storm. 	7720000
Mark looks over to him. 	7700000
He's a nice fellow, but he's a dreamer. ,	7690000
On the floor. 	7690000
Stan's incredulous. 	7680000
WALTER Because it has to encompass all children. 	7680000
Not now. 	7680000
ANNA looks over to ANDREW letting him know her disgust. 	7670000
A flash bulb goes off. 	7670000
MIA I do like jazz now, because of you. ,	7670000
MITCH `Bout time. 	7670000
FITZGERALD That right? 	7660000
You tell him from me...he should be. 	7660000
But the ball never returns. 	7660000
Punishment for losing. 	7650000
You like it? 	7650000
He reaches the gallery -- then stops, dumbfounded. ,	7640000
MAN (V.O.) We don't belong in this shithole. 	7640000
But it will. 	7610000
CLICK... pulls it again... 	7610000
The car pulls up to them and stops. 	7610000
What do you want? 	7610000
Then he notices the pictures on the old man's desk: There are dozens of them. 	7600000
KYLO REN Put him on board. 	7590000
Shading... 	7590000
Cooper looks up through the windows. 	7590000
POE What happened? 	7570000
He notices the smoke. 	7560000
On the radio. 	7560000
Trying not to impose on Jane's space. 	7560000
KANE You goin', Mom? ,	7550000
But I have faith. 	7540000
What kind of pants does a girl have to wear to be left alone? 	7530000
That does it. 	7530000
JULIAN This is the sixth one? 	7530000
Come to me. 	7520000
Nothing else is going to happen. 	7520000
What if that little alien reaches out and grabs me? 	7520000
After a beat, surprised by what he finds, he removes his hand. ,	7520000
Donald is at the controls. 	7510000
Haven't made them for thirty years. 	7510000
KANE Where's the soap? 	7510000
You're an incredible father and-- I feel lucky to have my husband back. 	7510000
JAKE (O.S.) Listen to me. 	7500000
HAGEN What about Luca? 	7500000
COOPER Listen to me. 	7490000
You're not too rich, or too famous that I can't help you? ,	7490000
RIGGAN Listen to me. 	7490000
Good or bad. 	7490000
The engines shut down. 	7490000
There isn't anything to say. 	7490000
To anyone I love? 	7480000
Tunnel's old -- the ice has reformed at the bottom. 	7480000
With the briefcase? 	7470000
If only he had his Anstadt. 	7460000
MIKE Can we-- Are we doing something here? 	7460000
REY What was that? 	7460000
KANE Please, Mr. Bernstein. ,	7460000
He walks back up to her in an aggressive way. 	7460000
REY What about him? 	7460000
I just never should have sent him away. 	7450000
Cooper looks over the relay log. 	7440000
MARGARET What do you want, Walter? ,	7430000
Tom gets up to leave. 	7430000
SUSAN I always like to see the funny side of things. 	7430000
MICHAEL For killing a man. 	7420000
Agony. 	7410000
CHRIS No-- (keys mike) It came from behind us. 	7410000
Caught in his glow. 	7390000
Then -- FLASH! FLASH! FLASH! Walter turns. 	7390000
KURT The hell does Sam think she is? 	7390000
SUSAN In the water. 	7380000
WALTER I call as my witness... 	7380000
But nothing has prepared him for this: He is completely alone. 	7380000
MIA I think today's San Diego. 	7370000
The pull to the light. 	7360000
Matter-of-fact -- SEBASTIAN The house across from the library. 	7340000
Trying to process his disgust. 	7330000
The energy swells and the four characters dance their way together down the street. 	7330000
Even Cooper stops, awed by the beauty of the display. ,	7330000
We see a vulnerability we haven't seen before - something lost or disoriented. 	7330000
Rey as a child. 	7330000
And frankly, I don't have to convince you. 83. ,	7320000
Then, a terrible, shameful idea forms: SNOBBY ARTIST #1 I'll bet I could bang one out in ten minutes. ,	7320000
CHRIS Where is everybody? 	7310000
ANDREW WALSH That's true, until its not. ,	7310000
There are good nights. 	7300000
ABEL You need to get home and start going through our set of books. 	7300000
Her face distorts in pain again. 	7300000
Kane stares at him. 	7300000
BILL O'LEARY It's not always as simple as it appears. 	7300000
This poor kid has been working his ass off. 	7290000
RIGGAN "I'm the wrong person to ask. 	7280000
RIGGAN "I'm the wrong person to ask. 	7280000
Because you are. 	7280000
KANE Keep it locked. 	7270000
Kane doesn't answer. 	7260000
COOPER What'd you paint? 	7260000
She doesn't say the words with any anger. 	7250000
I'm really scared. 	7250000
MARGARET How can you keep something so big a secret??? 	7240000
KANE Are you hurt? 	7240000
KANE Where is he? 	7220000
Dave looks around the open hood. 72. 	7220000
Leia hears this. 	7210000
ABEL First, please know that we respect the work you are doing to try to help our business and the city. ,	7210000
KANE I'm not sorry. 	7210000
On Bridge. 	7200000
Suddenly, the drone SOARS back over them. ,	7200000
The alarm will be in on Monday. 	7200000
They reach the front of Lionel's house. 	7190000
He wanted me with Fletcher's daughter. 	7190000
Dust blooms from it. 	7190000
Dollar signs in his eyes. 	7180000
HENRY Guess you would've been better off on your own. 	7170000
It is important to remember always that only at the very end of the story is Thompson himself a personality. 	7170000
Glass starts crawling toward it. 	7170000
AGAIN. He grabs his knife... is ready to finish Bridger off... ...but Fitzgerald is smart enough to know that out here, two are safer than one... even when one is just a kid. ,He starts walking away. ,	7170000
Anna! They wait. 	7160000
POE Well, because of you now we have a chance. ,	7160000
We don't want much smoke when we cook that grizzly. 	7160000
He puts it away and then looks up at the bridge that is hovering above him. 	7160000
SAM We? I didn't see you running for shit Reggie. 	7150000
ROTH Not enough, unfortunately. ,	7150000
He hugs her and she heads for the capsule. 	7150000
Over a year? 	7140000
ABEL I said...213,000. ,	7140000
PETER FORENTE Is everyone okay? 	7140000
Cooper, stunned, looks at Brand. ,	7130000
He's "won". 	7130000
Brand stares at it, startled. ,	7130000
I want you to meet someone. 	7130000
BRAND Where did they go? 	7130000
Several hundred years too late. 	7130000
BRAND It's a paradox. 	7130000
No sign of Margaret. 	7120000
CHRIS (keys mike) Dauber? 	7120000
I can't do them anymore, but you can, if you choose to. ,	7120000
Scattered applause, though no one has any idea what he's talking about. ,	7110000
GORDON Please put that away. 	7110000
MARGARET I just gave in. 	7100000
If it's on Jakku, we'll soon have it. ,	7100000
He shuts down the monitor. 	7090000
Don't worry. 	7090000
Exhausted. 	7090000
He stops and thinks about how to continue. 	7090000
He is getting an idea... 	7090000
But the robots survived. 	7090000
Look at this. 	7080000
Let's go. 	7070000
Exhausted. 	7070000
TAYA Well, this is the first time we left the house. ,	7070000
The audience laughs harder. 	7060000
As JULIAN is hiding, trying to figure out what to do next, LOUIS SERVIDIO goes running by him. ,	7060000
She sings about them and for them. 	7060000
Mia removes her shoes, feels the soft carpet under her feet. ,Turns on the projector. ,	7050000
He looks unsure. 	7050000
He looks at the piles of work, and can't face it. ,	7040000
Like, I don't... ,	7030000
ROTH Wherever we want. 	7030000
Then -- KEITH I get it. 	7030000
Exhausted. 	7020000
You lost? 	7020000
JAKE What's that? 	7000000
WALTER You sound crazy! For God's sake. 	7000000
FAST FOOD KID # 4. 	6990000
Has found where it's coming from... 	6990000
Kane at the window. 	6990000
He continues to stare. 	6990000
Is he really going to have to tell this guy the lay of the land? 	6990000
I said, "You motherfucker. ,	6940000
Gimme a hug. 	6940000
COOPER Am I really going to hurt anybody by going to look for her? 	6940000
WOMAN Cappuccino, please. ,	6940000
His transponder is still working. 	6930000
JULIAN I think so. 	6920000
COOPER You never had any? 	6920000
Go. Now. 	6910000
The track stops. 	6910000
JULIAN I didn't. 	6910000
This is the prize. 	6910000
Suddenly, he trips over something, dropping the equipment. ,	6910000
The dog lays by the door. 	6900000
Licks the metal plate. 	6900000
But I think Roth might be right. 	6890000
You decide you want to talk, you know where to find me. ,	6880000
TAYA I can't hear you-- CHRIS I'm ready to come home. 	6880000
The Priest considers this. 	6880000
ROTH About five minutes. 	6880000
He grimaces, embarrassed. ,	6870000
SOFIA What do you do in the bathroom? 	6870000
On the two of them - studying, contemplating... ,	6870000
Big one. 	6860000
Yes or no? 	6860000
MARK (STILL WATCHING) The fuck you talking about? 	6860000
Holds out his hand. 	6860000
FINN I disagree. 	6850000
The RADIO STATIC-- BIGGLES --I can't hear you. 	6850000
BRAND You're on this mission because you're another pair of hands. 	6850000
Slides in a suitcase. 	6840000
POE No, no, no. ,	6840000
Then the second set of doors open. 	6840000
Kane, in her name. ,	6830000
Over and over. 	6830000
THOMPSON Oh! I thought maybe we could have a drink together? 	6830000
Mia thinks about this one for a moment. 	6820000
Sees the Valet. 	6810000
This is one thing you're not going to have your own way about. 	6810000
KANE (quietly) Is it good? 	6800000
His curiosity doesn't make anyone else feel any better. 	6800000
BANDUCCI I like my club the way it is. 	6800000
Doyle looks behind them. 	6790000
Susan reaches out her hand. 	6790000
This is very serious. 	6780000
ABEL First off I don't walk around like I am saving anything. 	6780000
WOMAN Cappuccino, please. ,	6780000
Without looking up, she clings to him for a moment, and trembles. ,	6770000
How could you? 	6770000
They have another one waiting for me in orbit. 	6760000
And WE RETURN TO... 	6750000
Tell him. 	6750000
He continues to slam on the brakes and comes to a complete stop. 	6740000
JOHNNY He owns the studio. 	6740000
He's restless. 	6740000
DOCTOR HOFFSTADER I imagine you're still decompressing. 	6730000
The Stranger walks faster. 	6730000
Your job is to protect those Marines at all costs. 	6730000
BRAND What do you mean, you're going to let go? ,	6720000
An empire upon an empire. 	6720000
CHRIS How about this: one shot, one answer. ,	6720000
I'm driving down to the city with Kay tomorrow morning. 	6720000
CHRIS We don't have to do this... 	6720000
Makes a few notes in his file. 	6720000
LIONEL I think it's gaining sentience. 	6710000
Poe hits a control. 	6710000
I can see you. 	6710000
Finally, rallying them: LEIA Han's right. ,	6710000
Lionel gets up and walks towards the door. 	6700000
You lost. 	6700000
DU PONT Read the speech. 	6690000
THE PRESIDENT I understand that you have political ambitions. 	6690000
He's restless. 	6690000
ABEL That's possible. 	6690000
This is our stop. 	6680000
For old times' sake? 	6670000
His eyes linger a little too long and a little too low... 	6670000
He is a small man, very dark, with curly black hair. ,	6660000
GORDON Are we sure about this? 	6650000
Maybe it's an invitation. 	6650000
CITY EDITOR Oh, yes, it's already made up. ,	6640000
She looks him directly in the eye. 	6630000
JAKE How's it going, buddy. ,	6620000
ANDREW looks him right in the eye. 	6620000
The hall is coming apart in dusty chunks of plaster. 	6620000
Something sparks in Lionel. 	6620000
ABEL What's that? 	6610000
What you've decided I ought to have - what you'd want if you were me. 	6610000
Where's Calo? 	6610000
ABEL What's that? 	6610000
He's restless. 	6610000
COOPER Case, wait-- Case PUNCHES again. ,	6600000
Suddenly, GAS sprays back up at him. ,	6600000
There are other subjects in the world. 	6600000
HENRY We wait. 	6590000
SEBASTIAN When I unpack them in my club. 	6580000
We all will be if he keeps screamin' like that. 	6580000
She tries to suppress them. 	6570000
They've finished eating. 	6560000
KANE Get me a typewriter. 	6550000
SEBASTIAN Ok. Then I have someone I'd like you to meet. 	6550000
V.I.P. 	6550000
They look at each other, fixedly, but she doesn't give way. ,	6540000
Do you...indulge? 	6540000
V.I.P. 	6540000
I think he's drinking real gin. 	6530000
I just wanted to make sure you had all the information I do. 	6520000
FITZGERALD I had enough of this cold as hell shit. 	6520000
Cracks like a whip. 	6520000
But who's counting. 	6510000
I'm gonna have to start from scratch, with less than twenty-four hours... ,	6510000
It's not my fault I got Shanghai'ed. 	6510000
Tap my arm or bang something metal if you have a problem. 	6510000
Hope you're safe up there. 54. 	6500000
And the parents and the teachers. 	6500000
ABEL Is it clean? 	6480000
ABEL is standing off alone. 	6480000
She loves them. 	6480000
LELAND I'm glad to see you. 	6480000
Han looks to BB-8. 	6470000
The same one we saw in her car... 	6470000
It's going to be incredible... (beat; then, softer --) Well he has to get the money together first, and... ,	6470000
With that, the Boss walks off. ,	6460000
I know every time you... every time you look at me, you're reminded of him. ,	6460000
Han takes this in. 	6450000
WALSH (V.O.) What? 	6450000
Look at me... 	6440000
The same one we saw in her car... 	6440000
On the floor. (UNSURE) Really? 	6430000
HAN Any of it. 	6420000
Then he looks back down to his reflection in the water... battered and scarred. 	6420000
Garcia runs into the other room. 	6420000
And -- his eyes pop, astonished. ,	6420000
If we can find it on our scanners, the First Order's not far behind. ,	6410000
Nobody is there to share the moment. 	6410000
Lionel shakes it off. 	6400000
I didn't even know the guy. 	6400000
Dial it up, or down. ,	6400000
ANNA is besides herself. 	6400000
She cooks for one. 	6390000
GEORGE Don't you dare. 	6390000
You're the creator. 	6390000
We'll use the patch kit. 	6390000
Probably gives you cancer, but you find your car more quickly. ,	6370000
She says this as though just realizing it. 	6370000
And leaves. 	6360000
The crew looks out through the hull. 	6360000
The engine heats up white-hot. 	6350000
The cop gets in his car and prepares to drive away. 	6350000
You have a chance to do what no wrestler's done since 1904. 	6350000
I'll get the money. 	6350000
And I'll tell you why. 	6350000
I called her myself the day after he died. 	6340000
RUSTY How's Tess? 	6340000
And it's too damn cold to go without one. 35. 	6340000
BIGGLES They serve more customers than McDonalds. 	6340000
I wrestle at 180... 	6330000
And what's this year's theme? 	6330000
Probably gives you cancer, but you find your car more quickly. ,	6320000
The music has stopped. 	6320000
You'll like this. 	6320000
He looks idiotic. 	6320000
SEBASTIAN There's a nice way to say that. 	6310000
Moves a couple of boxes from the hall. 	6310000
SEBASTIAN Yeah I don't think so either. 	6310000
BRAND I'd trust him a lot more than I'd trust you. 	6300000
LESLEY Is he breathing? 	6300000
On edge... 	6300000
No one is there. 	6290000
You shouldn't have any knowledge about it anyway. 	6280000
Reaches for the curtains. 	6280000
Read that on the internet. 	6270000
Weaved bitch? (MORE) 26. 	6240000
Walter gives her a funny look. 	6240000
HAN The face of my son. 	6240000
MICHAEL You like spaghetti? 	6240000
SEBASTIAN There's a nice way to say that. 	6230000
We hear BOOS from a crowd. 	6230000
Doyle is freaking out. 	6230000
If you want to come here, you ask me. ,	6230000
ONE OF THE GIRLS Charlie! Play the song about you. 	6230000
And leaves. 	6220000
It was going to be a disaster. 	6210000
Catherine where did you find this? 	6210000
What we do see is the floor on which is located the City Room. 	6210000
Feels like a franchise. 	6210000
Let's do it. 	6200000
SAM (CONT'D) You get lost? 	6200000
Bernstein stares at him. 	6190000
RIGGAN Thanks for coming on such short notice, Mike. ,	6190000
They all look at Mike. 	6190000
It's pulling alongside them. 	6190000
I'm up in it a little bit here and I need something. 	6190000
Of course, he built it for her - THOMPSON That must have been love. ,	6180000
Chris fires and the GUARD'S HEAD explodes. 	6160000
GENERAL HUX We have their location. 	6150000
Mark is BLANK-FACED. Just waiting for it to end. 	6150000
BRAND That doesn't help this planet. 	6150000
Brand shines her flashlight over the ice again, but nothing happens. ,	6150000
THOMPSON That's all I'm interested in. 	6150000
MIA I have an audition. 	6150000
INT. CAR ON MERRITT PARKWAY The terrain turns to upscale country. 	6150000
Mia snaps out of it. 	6150000
In the gym. 	6140000
They can't hurt us if we're unarmed. 	6130000
I'll just sit with him; I want to show respect. 	6130000
DOYLE We're being pulled into it? 	6120000
ANNIE What's the headline? 	6110000
Surprised, the women laugh, too. ,	6100000
K, see you soon... ,	6100000
Henry waits for more... doesn't get it. 	6100000
I'm losing it. 	6090000
MARGARET What about... honesty? 	6090000
MIA (takes this in; then --) Congratulations. 	6090000
Finally, alone again. ,	6090000
Mia takes this in. 	6080000
He's still an outsider here - but something's changed in him. 88. 	6070000
I want you to save for a down payment. 	6060000
Had to gain some ground on Henry and them others. 	6060000
The train stops at the Junction On signal - but they don't like to wait. 	6060000
It'll be by the door. 	6060000
KANE I don't my plans myself. 	6050000
WAYNE Everything dies to give life. 	6050000
JULIAN I don't think so. 77 LOUIS SERVIDIO Did they or not? 	6050000
Feels like a franchise. 	6040000
SONNY It's me, Sonny. ,	6030000
She shoots looks at Sebastian. 	6020000
CHRIS (OS) (over radio) This is Charlie 7 Bravo. 	6020000
ANNA I need to know what they are saying we did. 	6020000
The space is small, simple -- but perfect. ,	6020000
So what is it? 	6020000
Call in our coordinates. 	6020000
ANNA I need to know what they are saying we did. 	6010000
Then, a final, crazed note. ,	6010000
They can't. 	6010000
Pops in his video. 	6000000
MIA To be in this band? 	6000000
U.S.A.... 	6000000
Eagle is good. (THEN) How're we doing with Dave? 	6000000
MIA (opening up) Yes? 	6000000
For the wrestling awards. 	6000000
I didn't know the man. 	5990000
I didn't know the man. 	5990000
I didn't know the man. 	5990000
We see a clock on the wall, ticking. ,	5980000
I got a call from the union... 	5970000
Outside, we HEAR THERESA cry out, almost a scream of relief. ,	5970000
They both nod knowing what's coming next. 	5970000
They'll help you. 	5960000
GLASS You shouldn't a come. 	5950000
U.S.A.... 	5940000
A real red-neck. 	5930000
The Europeans put up some of the funding... 	5930000
ANGLE - MARGARET She doesn't know what to say. 	5930000
A gift from Mr. Hesse. 	5920000
Fairbanks fights a smile. 	5920000
FITZGERALD Then what the hell have ya got? 	5920000
But jazz is about the future. 	5920000
SEBASTIAN This is Mia. 	5910000
GEORGE Yeah like this week. 	5900000
GENERAL HUX Yes, and he had help. (VEXED) From one of our own. ,	5870000
Has found where it's coming from... 	5870000
ANNA Do you want me to speak to my Brother about this? 	5870000
MIA (opening up) Yes? 	5860000
As a matter of fact, I've already left her. ,	5860000
He kisses her full on the lips before he sits down. 	5860000
If you want to see me, have the Warden write me a letter. ,	5850000
Lemme see. 	5850000
JULIAN thinks for a beat, then he starts off down the stairs again as well. ,	5850000
Rey looks around her to see she is.. 	5850000
A5 A5 It is later the same day. 	5840000
He taps the wheel. 	5840000
Don't turn away. 	5840000
He points over towards the chairs courtside. 	5840000
He says this as he leads him to the door. 	5830000
BLINKS a "yes" back at him. 	5830000
SUSAN Oh, me - KANE How old did you say you were? ,	5820000
Mike, don't do this to me, please Mike, don't do this to me! MICHAEL (quietly) Barzini is dead. ,	5820000
Ranger One backs off. 	5820000
GIRL What about Rosebud? 	5820000
Walter is a blessing. 	5810000
Okay, take care. ,	5800000
BERNSTEIN (sighs) You know how long it took the "Chronicle" to get that staff together? 	5800000
Slams it shut. 	5800000
It's great. 	5790000
Yes, it's yours... idiot. ,	5790000
ABEL It does matter, that you know we didn't do this. ,	5780000
The stage from the audience again. 	5780000
CHRIS A sniper won't aim for your head. 	5780000
The party is at a complete standstill. 	5780000
Slams it shut. 	5770000
Overcome, Margaret starts weeping. ,	5770000
I got it wrong. 	5770000
RIGGS How do you think it wound up here? 	5760000
They fall at his feet. 	5760000
Which Birdman was he in? 	5750000
I'm adapting. 	5750000
I couldn't hear, so I found myself staring... ,	5750000
WALTER "The world"? 	5750000
He looks down. 	5750000
He looks up. 	5750000
What do you say? 	5750000
RIGGAN (O.S.) I don't care, sign it. ,	5740000
A long, horrible pause. ,	5740000
RIGGS (FROM ABOVE) You think it's an alien? 	5740000
Slams it shut. 	5740000
THOMPSON What about that apartment? 	5740000
Maybe you could even coach? 	5730000
ENGINEER ROBOT Would you like me to install the chip? 	5730000
GLASS Thank you for what you done for me... stitchin' me back together... givin' me a chance. 	5720000
She sits down on the bed. 	5720000
He stops, and then laughs good naturedly. ,	5720000
Thatcher is on the stand. 	5720000
Dizzy, she clutches for support. ,	5710000
KANE (with a little smile) You're not going to like it in Chicago. 	5700000
But, it's pretty isolated. ,	5700000
We had Civ last semester? 	5700000
Which makes the administrator even less comfortable. 	5700000
DONALD Tom isn't the problem. 	5700000
WOMAN Is it true what they say about your husband, Sandra? ,	5700000
COOPER Feel like I should be pulling my weight. 150. 	5690000
Kane has met his eye. 	5690000
They've found a way to survive here. 	5690000
His eye is black. 	5690000
Has he taken money out of your bank account? 	5690000
I can't wait for you to see him play. 	5690000
ELIZABETH Yeah, she went under there to get that ball and came out with it. ,	5690000
You guys want anything? 	5680000
They both take a look at their watches. 	5680000
GROUPIE They hold so much feeling. 	5680000
Armstrong stays Black. 	5680000
MIA I'm good... 	5670000
The Baked Potato was gonna throw it away. 	5670000
What exactly are we hiding here? 	5670000
Without fanfare, she humbly turns the picture. ,	5670000
The Baked Potato was gonna throw it away. 	5660000
The "Enquirer" is without a telephone. 	5660000
MIKE Your assistant... (To Sam.) And can you speak? 	5660000
MIKE I'm Mike Shiner, by the way. ,	5660000
We would have to refund all the-- RIGGAN Then do it. 	5650000
A long pause... 	5650000
LAURA Nick, for God's sake. ,	5650000
We live in a palace - at the end of the world. 	5650000
MIA I have an audition. 	5640000
You are strong just by going. 	5640000
For your sake, I suggest you get it. ,	5640000
One minute. 	5640000
A Third Man is on the telephone. 	5630000
As he reads... 80. 	5630000
They turn. 	5620000
JULIAN does not agree. 	5620000
GOON #1 Just a few minutes more. 	5620000
He could tell you a lot. 	5620000
Trust me. 	5610000
It's beyond my abilities as a single woman... 	5610000
Will he go ballistic? 	5610000
KANE You don't expect me to keep any of those promises, do you? ,	5610000
It pays. 	5610000
He eyes her oversized T-shirt. 	5610000
The beat has long since stopped. 	5610000
With that, the Boss walks off. ,	5600000
But I love it too much. 	5600000
ABEL We need to find him. 	5590000
Need to try them out. 	5590000
She looks away -- she's crying. 	5590000
Kane stops - looks at him. 	5590000
TROY Come on Coco. 	5590000
HENRY That's enough, Fitzgerald. ,	5590000
SEBASTIAN When I unpack them in my club. 	5580000
The REF blows the end of match whistle. 	5580000
MARGARET No --! You can't go in -- DEE-ANN I just want a peek. 	5580000
She recoils, but has nowhere to go. ,	5570000
Cooper takes a final step. 	5570000
GIRL (calling out) Who is she anyway? 	5570000
KANE Why, Brad? ,	5570000
MICHAEL I want to settle things tonight. 	5570000
I lived in reality... not whatever this world is you are living in. 	5570000
It's a strained hug. 	5570000
SARAH Just let him out. 	5560000
They look at each other with concern. 91 ANNA You're going to see your little brother? 	5560000
Why'd you promise them Cinerama size? 	5560000
They may have the map already. 	5560000
This shouldn't be a problem. 	5559999
That line sits for a long beat. 	5550000
No bougie bitches allowed. 76C Sam removes the pins and the black power Afro pic holding 76C up her pompadour fro hair-do, and lets it fall flat around her ears. ,She takes in her image in the mirror. ,	5550000
DISSOLVE: Same setup as before except that it is spring. 	5550000
It is correct. 	5550000
It's trying to incorporate you into its structure. 	5540000
MIKE DO IT! RIGGAN (Jumps in w/out thinking.) "Hey. 	5540000
Trust me.... 	5540000
The only light is from his suit's light array. 	5530000
How do you think our donor base will feel about that? 	5530000
SEBASTIAN I've got to follow my own plan. 	5530000
His actions are hurting me and my business. 	5520000
WAYNE KYLE (VO) There are three types of people in this world. 	5520000
And he then does the pause and the look just as he was taught. 	5520000
His mom does parking at school and she asked for my help. 	5520000
Did you pop your cherry? 	5520000
The memories are never that far away. 	5510000
He turns back to offer Brand a hand. 	5510000
He has the ability to look at me and see where I am in life. 	5510000
LELAND What's this? 	5500000
BRAND How could the Chinese have gotten here first? 	5500000
MIA Hey it's me... 	5500000
CHRIS KYLE Fucking hot box. 	5490000
The one from the village. 	5490000
KANE (screaming) It's the only vein I know. 	5490000
Martin points to a map, south of the wall is green, north of wall is red. ,	5490000
A Reporter does a stand-up: REPORTER #1 The jury found in favor of Margaret Keane on all points. 	5480000
ABEL I got us a three more days... and one piece... from Saul. 	5480000
We'll get him. 	5480000
MIA ...Ok. AMY BRANDT So why don't you just tell us a story? 	5480000
The robot straps himself in next to him. 	5470000
SPOTTED HORSE You spend your life hunting enemy. 	5470000
I'm stopping by the post office. 	5460000
But we can still save him. 	5450000
Gives him a hug. 	5450000
GOON #1 We're gonna step outside now. 	5450000
The ladies are stricken. 	5440000
You act like it's all okay-- CHRIS It is okay. 	5440000
For men will be lovers of themselves. 	5440000
RUNTY MAN The black son of a bitch that robbed me. ,You tell him that. ,	5430000
If it was anybody else, I'd say what's going to happen to you would be a lesson to you. ,	5430000
Mia looks at him. 	5430000
K, see you soon... ,	5420000
That was incredibly brave, what you did. ,	5420000
ABEL I got us a three more days... and one piece... from Saul. 	5420000
The junk as well as the art. 	5420000
Please tell me. 	5420000
LAURA Did anyone call for help? 	5420000
LAURA Say something else... (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 29. 	5410000
Mia looks at him. 	5410000
I'm not sure how you... (WORRIED) I was raised Methodist. 	5410000
Mark stops shaking. 	5400000
MITCH Want to know why they used to call me Black Mitch? 	5400000
Tars follows him. 	5400000
Two and a half ... 	5400000
They approach, as though about to kiss... ,	5400000
When he detonates it, we'll only have a few seconds. ,	5400000
I figured you could do the honors. 	5400000
BRAND Shut up. 	5400000
DANNY That's why we've got to be very careful. 	5390000
TROY That's the magazine right? 	5390000
Valedictorian. 	5380000
I can't wait. 	5380000
Cooper reads the information pouring into his laptop. 15. 	5380000
You must have a little gypsy in ya. 	5370000
Eerie. 	5370000
Thompson, you've made us a good short, but it needs character - SOMEBODY'S VOICE Motivation - RAWLSTON That's it - motivation. ,	5370000
GORDON Couldn't you see him on the talk show Kurt? 	5370000
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) I'd just as soon leave both you and your nigger here to rot. `Cept killin' you ain't worth givin' up your share. (LEANS CLOSER) But that don't mean I can't be coaxed into changin' my mind. ,Fitzgerald shoves him away... ,	5360000
DANNY Why should I mind? 	5360000
He reaches into his briefcase, and takes out several pictures and papers. ,	5360000
Behind the lights and through them, we see a nasty early morning. ,	5360000
It stares back at him. 	5350000
Now go. 	5340000
What are you talking about... what shots? 	5340000
Desperately. 	5340000
MARK (no idea what to say) They said it was the library. 	5330000
How much can she trust? 	5330000
It's going to annoy us into taking it home. 	5330000
COOPER What difference would that make? 	5330000
A very long way indeed. 	5330000
But we got a sniper picking off contractors from deep behind the wall. 	5320000
He hopes not, but he is judging to see if PETER had anything to do with all these attacks. ,	5320000
Or Hearst for that matter? 	5310000
Sweet heart is that really your skin? 	5310000
His finger taking up the trigger-slack. 	5310000
The DON is about to give his answer. 	5300000
You try to slice all the black off? 81. 	5300000
Isn't it? 	5300000
COOPER It's a Chinese military drone. 	5290000
They got cameras, they got watchers, they got locks, they got timers, they got vaults. ,	5290000
COOPER We were just looking for salvage. 	5290000
JULIAN But I know things... 	5290000
These trucks they drive, the customers they serve. ,	5280000
We haven't had an incident since November. 	5280000
Coming from the main house we hear the doorbell ring. 	5280000
He hits him again. 	5270000
CHRIS KYLE You haven't heard? 	5270000
So I destroyed him. 	5260000
Mia looks at him. 	5260000
COOPER They didn't have any baseball at all when I was a kid. 	5260000
What are you doing? 	5250000
FATHER OF KID (from the floor) Please! He can't understand. 	5250000
Or to you. 	5250000
He is getting paranoid. 	5240000
A WIREFRAME OF THE DEATH STAR APPEARS. POE (CONT'D) This was the Death Star. 	5240000
Right now - SUSAN I'll discuss what's on my mind when I want to. 	5240000
It doesn't really matter to us who it is or how we do it as long as it's progress. 	5240000
COOPER (LAUGHS) You don't look like one. (off her look) With the rifle, I mean. ,	5240000
DAVE How you doing? 	5240000
MIA (takes this in; then --) Congratulations. 	5230000
PHONE RINGS, goes to message: CHRIS (OS) It's me again. ,	5230000
COOPER Because that was the plan. 	5230000
DISSOLVE: The same setup again, it is now summer. ,	5230000
KANE There's only one person in the world to decide what I'm going to do - and that's me. 	5230000
Looks at it. 	5230000
VOICE (O.S.) Do you recognize my voice? 	5230000
DONALD (SMILES) Parent-teacher conference day. 	5220000
MIA I'm happier. 	5220000
Another MARK; another DAY. And there are THOUSANDS of marks. 	5220000
Mia looks at him. 	5210000
DAVE The window's open. 	5210000
MARGARET M-Margaret... 	5210000
I will present it to him. 	5210000
You have the email printed in front of you. 	5210000
And spend time with your family. 	5210000
We might... 	5200000
An apology, to him. ,	5200000
MIA (opening up) Yes? 	5200000
Cooper takes in the incredible surroundings. 	5180000
COOPER What does that mean? 99. 	5180000
They both look out for a beat. 	5180000
The clock reads: 4:57am. 	5180000
Looks at it. 	5180000
Cooper backs up to his plane. 	5180000
Then I'm gonna make my move. 	5170000
COOPER No. I don't know what this place is, but we're leaving. ,	5170000
I had to quit my job. 	5160000
Something made of china breaks, but not the glass ball. ,	5160000
There is no answer from Kane. 	5160000
This is a sore spot and he backs off. 	5160000
MURPH (QUIET) Couldn't we just let it go? 	5160000
He's holding a drink. 	5160000
The worst thing about high school, and believe me it was a long list, were the Black kids. ,	5150000
We just hear the sounds of his feet getting lower and lower. 	5150000
No. They have stopped the leak. 	5150000
Mocassins. 	5150000
Looks at Lionel then at the house. 	5140000
Talked to the Dean today. (MORE) 35. 	5130000
I feel it too. 	5130000
Tars double checks his work. 	5120000
CUT TO: 94E The Dean tries one more. 	5120000
Then -- a light turns on. 	5110000
I'm grateful to be alive. 	5110000
While your peers are taking internships, making short films... ,	5110000
What is wrong with that? 	5110000
And what about you? 	5100000
He is the investigator. 	5100000
JUNIOR Hello, Pop! I was in a box. ,	5100000
Margaret cuts over to Walter. 	5100000
ABEL Any new market is a tough one. 	5090000
SOFIA Is it Sam? 	5090000
What do you got? 	5090000
Then begins playing out a bit more, his fingers starting to race. ,	5080000
It's just a piece. 	5080000
Behind her is a wallpapered wall, and a small window. ,	5080000
She walks out. 	5070000
How's papa White? 	5060000
Walter pulls out his ace. 	5060000
ACROSS THE ROOM Margaret stares him down. 	5060000
If there wasn't no `Ree around before, there will be now. ,	5060000
And eventually a little smile comes across her face. 	5060000
HENRY You figure this is smart then? 	5050000
With this, we can. ,	5050000
He starts to almost cry, but then it again becomes something else. ,	5040000
Brand sees him. 	5040000
Just as he grips the tire iron waiting... 	5040000
ABEL Joanne it's me. 	5040000
Mark doesn't answer, just stands looking at him. ,	5030000
I won't give it to them. 	5030000
I want to understand. 	5030000
You want the truth? 	5030000
He then stops again. 	5030000
You can't buy Dave. 	5020000
ANNA And took the deposit? 	5020000
Has found where it's coming from... 	5010000
They worship everything and they value nothing. 	5000000
His arm is on her shoulder now. 	5000000
I -- I just -- CASTING DIRECTOR One second. 	5000000
You don't know what it means to feel - to know that people - that an audience don't want you. 	5000000
One, two, three... ,	5000000
Close your eyes. 	5000000
In the tree. 	4990000
Might be some copper inside. 	4990000
And hating every second. 	4990000
The container says "GREEN DYE #7" on it. 	4990000
MITCH What other "magazine" you know has a first look deal at NBC? The third biggest Youtube channel. 	4980000
Jane and I used to be so close... but -- now... 	4980000
They're mobilizing. 	4980000
Henry takes the journal... flips it open. 	4970000
If...once we go to series, we might have to figure out a summer schedule. ,	4970000
Because I'm not sure we're worth saving. 	4970000
Feel it. (MORE) (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: MAZ (CONT'D) The light. 	4960000
What if it's a blood diamond? 	4960000
It spits dirt. 	4950000
A few dab their eyes. 	4950000
You could replace Peter's money and get him out of the deal. 	4940000
In the restaurant, wait and talk a while, and then ask permission to go. ,	4930000
Don't stop. 	4930000
She nears the BATHROOM door -- but a COUPLE stands in her way, making out. ,	4930000
CHRIS It was evil, man. ,	4930000
You got a lot to learn. 	4930000
It's important for you to realize that these are very dangerous times, and we need to adapt. ,	4930000
HENRY But you figure they're `Ree. 	4920000
TAYA --it's happening-- (03.18.14) 60. 	4920000
They can barely talk anymore. 	4910000
She's too grateful to talk. 	4910000
About how independent I was. 	4910000
If he's right - and the papers publish this story he has - KANE Oh, they'll publish it all right. ,	4910000
SEBASTIAN Yeah, feasibly -- I could be on the road for years with just this record. ,	4910000
There is music and light coming from a room past all the cubicles... 42. 36 INT. BULLPEN - NIGHT 36 ...An office filled with computers. 	4910000
Debris blocks a back-door. 	4900000
When the war was over, they didn't know when to stop fighting. ,	4900000
MIA Sebastian, no one's going to a club called "Chicken on a Stick". ,	4900000
SUNGMI Hey, about the rally. ,	4900000
HENRY What's out that direction? 	4890000
O'Leary. 	4890000
She nears the BATHROOM door -- but a COUPLE stands in her way, making out. ,	4890000
MURPHY Oh, Jesus. ,	4880000
I'm trying to work. 	4880000
Motions to the Valet: Sorry. 	4870000
TAYA Chris-- F-18 seconds out. 	4870000
He looks at the clock. 	4870000
She picks up her rebreather and begins looking over it. 	4870000
ABEL He seemed good... 	4870000
GORDON You seen this one? 	4870000
LORAINE LEFKOWITZ I understand. 	4860000
RIGGAN (Breaking character to direct. 	4860000
Motions to the Valet: Sorry. 	4860000
Military history. 	4860000
Then she turns back at the pile of boxes that hold their past and their future. 	4860000
We see her haggle with the OWNER -- and then light up. 	4860000
MARK (ON PHONE) (HE DOESN'T) What does he want to talk about? 	4850000
He looks him over, undamaged but for the eyes. ,	4840000
CAPTAIN PHASMA FN-2187. 	4840000
KANE He used to work fast - didn't he, Mr. Bernstein? ,	4840000
INSTRUCTOR ROLLE Was that your ass talking then? 	4840000
But then he STOPS. Feels something. 	4840000
Team Foxcatcher is beginning to come together. 33. 	4840000
COMMANDING OFFICER (OS) (over radio) Negative. 	4830000
You believe that? 	4830000
DAVE What does that mean? 	4830000
Maybe it means something. 	4830000
Believe me. 	4830000
SONNY Christ, if I could only contact Luca. ,	4830000
Tosses it in the trash. 	4830000
Something has caught her attention. 	4820000
I did something about it. 	4820000
Go home! HAN Leia doesn't want to see me. 	4820000
Walter listens to the raucous mob. 	4820000
But something seems to come over him now. 	4810000
RIGGAN I want him gone. 	4800000
RAYMOND Can't say, sir. ,	4800000
JEFF A strong wind'd put Sarah in the mood. 	4790000
EMILY I intend to find out. 	4790000
Nope. 	4790000
SEBASTIAN ...You still think New York? 	4790000
But I just came back from a party on campus and I think you should know about it. 	4790000
WALTER Really?! 90. 	4790000
JAKE (Worried.) Did they ask about Ralph? 	4790000
EMILY Let me see it. 	4780000
SUSAN Charlie! I said, what time is it? ,	4780000
INT. COLLAPSED HOUSE -- DAY Cooper stands in the middle of his kitchen. 	4770000
But he can still see where he used to feed his kids breakfast. 	4770000
He runs along the road. 	4770000
CHRIS So much for him having my horseshoe. (03.18.14) 85. 	4770000
I'll show them how Team Guys do it and lead a unit in the street. 	4770000
He sits on a chair. 	4770000
I allowed him to take credit for the big eyes. 	4770000
SEBASTIAN ...I -- I guess... 	4770000
SAM Like, can we have a movie with, you know characters in them? `Stead of stereotypes wrapped in Christian dogma? ,	4770000
SUSAN I didn't get a thing. 	4760000
When he opens them he sees Chris looking. 	4750000
Tosses it in the trash. 	4750000
She is affected by this. 	4750000
The rest are completely frozen. 	4750000
A SHOT RINGS OUT. Red mist. 	4750000
MISS TOWNSEND (reading) Mr. and Mrs. 	4750000
WALTER Cute. 44. 	4740000
And stares at her. 	4740000
SUSAN I did a lot of singing after that. 	4740000
Morning rush hour. 	4740000
It's very aggressive. 	4740000
Got that? 	4730000
Plays the same passage over. 	4730000
It says the neighbors are getting suspicious. 	4720000
Plays the same passage over. 	4720000
Morning rush hour. 	4720000
You get as far away from here as you can. 	4720000
A BABY starts crying. 	4720000
She has difficulty in holding on to it. 	4720000
Then, without comment, she storms away. ,	4720000
BOSS I do, and I don't want to hear the free jazz. ,	4710000
CUT TO: 94E The Dean has Facebook opened on his computer. 	4710000
You get a bead? 	4710000
CASE They didn't do a very good job. 	4710000
Can't believe it. 	4710000
DON CORLEONE No. Let the people enjoy him. 	4700000
Cooper finally breaks them off. 	4700000
Cooper squints -- the light is blinding. 	4700000
DEAN FAIRBANKS By any means necessary? 	4700000
I'm not moving on. 	4700000
She knows he doesn't believe what he's saying. 	4700000
This is you. 	4690000
She turns a little on him. 	4690000
Never took you as a student politician... 	4690000
TIGHT - WALTER He starts to answer... then gives her a look: You are kidding? 	4690000
SEBASTIAN What's that? 	4680000
SEBASTIAN Can't you rehearse anywhere? 	4680000
MIA'S DAD It's fun having you back. 	4680000
All of the skills you seem to have developed. 	4680000
After a pause, Kane speaks. ,	4670000
They all seem to be waiting for him to continue. 	4670000
Walks to the screen door. 	4670000
We need you both there to lay everything out and be totally up- front. 	4670000
BB-8 NUDGES R2. Nothing. 	4670000
We linger on Sebastian. 	4670000
Kane looks slowly at Mr. Kane. 	4670000
You'll expose us all. 	4660000
KANE You've got a private office here, haven't you? ,	4660000
SEBASTIAN So I'm doing that. 	4660000
The Sheepdog does it again. 	4660000
They're savages. 	4660000
She was playing with it. 	4660000
FN-2187 Because it's the right thing to do. 	4660000
Look at that. 	4660000
You interested? 	4650000
Everyone is getting worked-up. 	4640000
ABEL I can tell you the girls didn't look like that where I went to school... 	4640000
You feel like he's the father you never had. 	4640000
The bloom is off the rose. (BEAT) But I'm looking out for both of us. 	4630000
I wear many hats. 	4630000
Henry's still lost in those screams. 	4630000
As the KID comes to his senses he tries to stand up. 	4630000
MIA'S DAD You look hungry. 	4630000
SUSAN Oh! KANE I can't stay here all night chasing your pain away. 	4630000
I just -- we're going to have to do things so we can see each other. 	4630000
The rabbit continues on past. 	4620000
Nods to the OWNER, off to the side. ,	4620000
HAN Keep it, kid. ,	4620000
WALTER Excuse me, Ladies. ,	4610000
You still drive me crazy. 	4610000
TAYA I hate the teams for it. 	4610000
ANNA We follow standard industry practice on every front. 	4610000
Not like he anticipated. 	4610000
Mia looks at Sebastian. 	4610000
I'm letting life hit me `til it gets tired. 	4610000
She looks at ANDREW. ANNA We follow standard industry practice on every front. 	4610000
It's over- (violent) You did your part! We sacrificed enough. 	4610000
BEAT COP Excuse me? 	4610000
BRIDGER Thank you. 	4600000
LIONEL Uh. Excuse me. 	4600000
Hawaiian MUSIC begins... 	4600000
And somehow you've ended up with everything you wanted. 	4600000
Then -- a SHOE steps on it. 	4590000
LIONEL (CONT'D) Culture has a powerful way of telling people what they can and can't be. 	4590000
God bless them. 	4590000
Life couldn't form without gravity. 	4590000
You're not really giving anything that belongs to you, that you care about. ,	4590000
SUSAN (to the Captain) I want another drink, John. ,	4590000
He takes out two large empty briefcases. 	4580000
We linger on Sebastian. 	4580000
KEITH (O.S.) Sebastian? 	4580000
BRIDGER What now? 	4580000
Cooper gets up to leave. 	4580000
The murder of Mrs. 	4580000
SEBASTIAN ...This is home. 	4570000
THOMPSON We'd better get along. 	4570000
I can sign a draft made good by Captain Henry. 	4570000
Show me again, the power of the darkness, and I will let nothing stand in our way. ,	4570000
They're calling you The Legend. 	4570000
A scientist? 	4570000
We went through the last year's data and triangulated the source. 	4560000
A moment of quiet. 	4560000
SEBASTIAN ...What does that mean? 	4560000
Troy doesn't know how to answer that. 	4550000
SOFIA You'd go without me? 	4550000
I don't care whether they know what I know about him. 	4550000
MARK (walking up to him) Sir, you need me for something? ,	4550000
KYLO REN I know what I have to do, but I don't know if I have the strength to do it. ,	4540000
Bridger smiles... relieved. 	4540000
WALTER What would make a grown man paint a picture like this?! No answer. 	4540000
He was kind of queer, but I knew how to handle him. ,	4540000
I hate my brother's friends. 	4530000
LILY Doesn't he talk about me? 	4530000
Some of the wrestlers open the glass doors and start taking down what's in there. 	4530000
You can only cause a lot of trouble. 	4520000
REY Where am I? 	4520000
They're encrypted. 	4520000
EXT. CAVE - DAY Sunny and clear. 	4510000
The Judge stares off... then makes a decision. 	4510000
This creature is doomed. 	4510000
The Judge turns to him. 	4510000
He rises and shakes Cooper's hand. 	4510000
I thought it was a good idea. 	4500000
We're searching the area. 	4500000
Look at me. 	4500000
Viper Marines drag the soldier out. 	4500000
Margaret's interest is piqued. 	4490000
COOPER How much time? 	4490000
We stay with him as he sits quietly just watching. 	4490000
FITZGERALD So if we do this, we do every step with our own feet. ,	4490000
They built it for thousands of people. 	4490000
No result. 	4480000
Another INSTRUCTOR looks on. 	4480000
The men just stare back at him, like they're all part of the same dream. ,	4480000
Go to your own room - MARK - Your kids are in here - She BLOWS SMOKE at him. 	4480000
Malcolm gives Keith a look: "Damn". 	4480000
She and Sebastian start walking. 	4480000
I swear... 	4480000
He's left totally alone. 	4480000
CHRIS They got sniping in the Olympics now? 	4470000
Lionel takes in this moment. 	4470000
MARGARET I've never posted bail before. 	4460000
Lionel shakes his head "yes" and "no" at the same time. 	4460000
JEFF I'm just tired, man. ,	4460000
ABEL I don't know how you get anything done around here. 	4460000
JULIAN Bulk delivery to Chase. 	4450000
THOMPSON You're that guy. 	4450000
TAYA Did you pleat those jeans? 	4440000
Kane, I'm not asking you to believe me. ,	4440000
And those fake trees... (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 27. 	4430000
Roth checks his watch with his usual detachment. 	4430000
And I've got the basics... 	4430000
SEBASTIAN There's a nice way to say that. 	4430000
No one's in sight. 	4430000
BACK TO SCENE JOHN What is this shit? 	4430000
Uh-oh. 	4420000
SEBASTIAN Oh God, I didn't see them. ,	4420000
A job offer. 	4410000
She's feeling herself as she's handed a drink. 	4410000
ABEL That's how much has been taken from me over the last six months. 	4410000
So my club's gonna be old-school jazz and beer and chicken. "Chicken on a Stick". 	4410000
The MEN walk down another row of parked cars. 	4400000
The MEN walk down another row of parked cars. 	4400000
Something to sum up the moment. 	4400000
It will allow us to talk to earth, even on the far side of the wormhole. ,	4400000
Neither one of them has clean underwear... 	4390000
DEAN FAIRBANKS Every race issue is my issue. 	4390000
Runs his fingers through Lionel's hair. 85. 	4380000
Kane, are the sole owner. ,	4370000
SAM On your knees. 	4370000
ABEL Are you alright? 	4370000
The guy toddles away. 	4360000
And I need him to turn himself in. 	4360000
It doesn't mean anything. 	4360000
He sits down next to them, lighting a cigarette. ,	4360000
He's probably in trouble again. 	4360000
TROY That was different. 	4360000
KEITH No. It's tonight. 	4360000
Rey looks off, in thought. ,	4350000
Troy's homeboy swag is thicker than usual. 	4350000
Ah! Sun breaking through clouds. 	4350000
MARK (QUIET) Please don't do that. 70. 	4350000
Identical rows of little yards. 	4350000
MIA No, that's not what I meant. ,	4350000
It stops at the wall. 	4350000
Tosses it in the trash. 	4340000
JUDGE This is a very strange case. 	4340000
TROY I'm good to her. 	4340000
A 100 years from now, will people even know we existed...? 75. ,	4340000
You don't believe you can ever do better than your brother. 	4330000
MARK The minute you step on the mat, you are exactly who you are. ,	4330000
LIONEL For the first time in my life, I can't just sit around and do nothing. ,	4320000
Jane freezes, not sure whether to believe. ,	4320000
BOSS I do, and I don't want to hear the free jazz. ,	4320000
ABEL To you too. 	4320000
Annie turns up a Youtube video of... 	4320000
LAWRENCE I'm sure you will. 	4320000
It is the weekend and the place is empty. 	4320000
ABEL You sure? 	4320000
RIGGAN What are you, counting? (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 32. ,	4320000
ANDREW gets in his car and drives away. 	4310000
The drive, the poetry, it's all gone. ,	4310000
JAKE What'd I say? 	4310000
SOCIETY MAN Er... yes. 	4310000
He's sick for good this winter. 	4300000
ABEL looks around a beat then follows. 	4290000
His nephew has been refused parole. 	4290000
A large GROUP of the PARENTS surround the table. 	4290000
MICHAEL My brother, Tom Hagen. ,	4290000
He takes over for her. 	4290000
The guard has, by this time, delivered the precious journal. ,	4280000
He points at Margaret's canvas. 	4280000
ABEL That describes many people at this point. 	4280000
It wasn't just me. 	4280000
Don't lie. 	4280000
The baby's bed is in a corner of the room. 	4280000
I will kick the shit out of you. 	4280000
Looks at the equipment, thinking it over. ,	4280000
He sits up, looks around. ,	4280000
BOSS I do, and I don't want to hear the free jazz. ,	4280000
CLICK. But he's too scared to stop his finger... 	4270000
KANE It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein. ,	4270000
Maybe it'd be good to be around...you know. 	4270000
Both HAGEN and SONNY react. 	4270000
The house grows quiet. 	4270000
Kane has come up to Leland and Bernstein. 	4270000
She begins on her eyes. 	4270000
SEBASTIAN It is strange. 	4270000
RAYMOND You can go on asking questions if you want to. 	4270000
A woman, 30s, step out from the trees. ,	4270000
CASE You're the man who brought us the probe? (off his look) Thank you. 	4260000
We HEAR radios -- one piece of music after another... 	4260000
SUSAN It makes a whole lot more sense than collecting Venuses. 	4260000
Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone. ,	4260000
They're not impersonal crimes against people. 	4260000
SEBASTIAN It is strange. 	4260000
On Kurt Fletcher's staff? 	4260000
Kane doesn't see it at first. 	4260000
Not able to look her in the eye... 	4250000
RIGGAN Then make him go away. 	4250000
GEORGE On my way to class, but you can stay and check out last year's piece. ,	4240000
I said a prayer to him. 	4240000
The ship should be able to withstand the blast. 	4240000
Let her slide! He turns away, and we can now read the headline. ,	4240000
Enjoys a good challenge. 	4240000
Are those your lips sweetie? 	4240000
He gets closer and closer. 	4240000
They drive off and nobody says a word for a very, very long time. ,	4230000
Split up. 	4230000
I will not tell them to you again. (he is very close to her) You will continue with your singing. 	4230000
Do you know Ian Thompson? 	4230000
SEBASTIAN I'll be front-row. 	4230000
MARK (CONT'D) I wasn't... 	4220000
Makes a decision. 	4220000
Essentially it's more efficient at consuming our food than we are. 	4220000
Left ear of whites. 	4210000
But I'll let him know you stopped by. 	4210000
ABEL's wife ANNA was driving the car behind him. 	4210000
ROTH Not make it. 	4210000
JEFF You know what they called her in high school-- CHRIS Don't say it. 	4210000
Troy pokes his head in. 	4210000
Tears stream down her face as she resists. 	4210000
He thought I was just being...difficult. 	4210000
We HEAR radios -- one piece of music after another... 	4210000
MARK Stan, please. ,	4210000
The old man carefully takes out the watch. 	4210000
From a distance you look like a painter, but up close... there's nothing there. 69. ,	4210000
I'm ready... 	4200000
SMATHERS (as though Kane were talking Greek) We can't remake them, Mr. Kane. ,	4200000
Go! Poe turns to him. 	4200000
FITZGERALD I'd be careful if I was you, boy. ,	4200000
LAWRENCE I think I know your father. 	4190000
TAYA Sounds like you're under attack. 	4190000
Then she fills in the shape of his head. 	4190000
And I'm begging you, if you love me, please, do me a favor... don't fuck it up. ,	4190000
She's got eyes on her - for the first time like this at a party. 	4180000
I want a hot dog. 8. 	4180000
We have to be ready for that. 	4180000
FBI MAN #2 Hey, Radio Shack: relax. 35 EXT. SANTA MONICA BOARDWALK - LATER 35 Livingston walks down the boardwalk. ,	4170000
MIKE (Exploding.) "Yeah! Alright? 	4170000
Suddenly he stops again. 	4170000
SONNY Ma, I just got a call. ,	4170000
Another follows, and another, until the cave entrance is full. ,	4170000
Two ARMED GUARDS get out of the van. 	4160000
ANDERSON It's rocky and steep goin'. 	4160000
A look between them, fully aware of what comes next. ,	4160000
We kept waiting for someone to come help us. 	4160000
We HEAR Nancy's voice yell from inside: "It's open!" Mark opens the door. 	4160000
This sits in the room for a long beat. 	4160000
FBI MAN #1 What? 	4160000
FINN I'm not Resistance. 	4150000
STEVE In that case, the Grand Old Party wants to help find you one. ,	4150000
ABEL Right now they are just saying us. 	4150000
Troy takes this in. 	4150000
Go back to playing "Jingle Bells" so I can save money for some Shangri-La club no one wants to go to? 	4150000
Henry spins his head away from Glass. 	4150000
The deer is dead. 	4150000
ABEL I put 40 percent down as a deposit on this. 	4150000
GORDON Not a fan? 	4150000
CHRIS If something ever happened to me-- you'd meet someone else. 	4150000
We'll have to send someone ahead to get a fourth. 81. 	4140000
They all stare at each other. 	4130000
Kurt eyes this new adversary. 	4130000
KANE Is that what you want to do? 	4130000
First, the Parisian street scenes, one after another... ,	4130000
He should've known that. 	4130000
TAYA I said I'd never marry one. 	4130000
You should go settle in. 	4120000
She looks at him in shock. 	4120000
Cause right now-- A technician walks by. 	4120000
KANE He was dead... 	4120000
FITZGERALD When I see who? 92. 	4120000
I hate to do it, but Imma have to get real Black with you. ,	4120000
SAM -- then stand up for his own. 	4120000
What made Kane what he was? 	4120000
THOMPSON (coldly) We're leaving tonight. 	4120000
And, for that matter, what was he? ,	4120000
Margaret frowns and rips the paper. 	4110000
LARRY I'm gonna need to go shopping again. 	4110000
ABEL leaves and they stay. 	4110000
Du Pont stands up. 	4110000
ANOTHER VOICE That's what Arthur Ellis is writing now. 	4110000
WALTER Whew! Something smells in here. 	4110000
She's playing Coco. 	4110000
LELAND Yes. (looking down) Now, will you let me go to Chicago? ,	4110000
Then, very quietly: MARK I don't want to let you down. 43. ,	4110000
And the Skype call is over. 	4100000
He's speechless. 	4090000
MARGARET I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that. 	4090000
How's that hamstring? 	4080000
He backs off. 	4080000
Sam's got it. 	4080000
We stay on her as she gets the news. 	4080000
And what's cooler than being a sniper? 	4080000
Because I can't have it going on any longer either. 	4080000
Unlocks the door just as his partner, THUG #2, does the same thing on the passenger side, but he is holding a gun. ,	4070000
Water is bubbling into her suit through the open mask. 	4070000
Mark LOOKS OUT over the dark grounds of Foxcatcher. 	4070000
LAWRENCE In a very short time. 	4070000
TROY I have no idea. 	4070000
SEBASTIAN Why does it say "Seb's"? 	4070000
Hi. I'm Lionel. 	4070000
ABEL Have you seen Julian? 	4060000
HENRY Roll him over... easy. 	4060000
He hurls the glass against the wall. 	4060000
No! I shouldn't even ask. 	4060000
No, I'm kind of giving myself a bit of a break right now. ,	4060000
Sebastian's wearing the new suit. 	4060000
Kurt's hand is on Lionel's collar. 	4060000
MURPHY That you, Fitzgerald? ,	4040000
He steps right into the guy's face. 	4040000
I'm terrified. 	4040000
A DOZEN MARINES are posted outside an apartment complex. 	4040000
Please, Susan - Susan! She is staring at him. ,	4040000
RAYMOND What do you think all that is worth, Mr. Thompson? ,	4040000
ANNA You've got three minutes. 	4040000
Do you want to know what happens? 	4030000
KYLO REN I'm impressed. 	4030000
BRIDGER (O.S.) What's goin' on? 31. 	4030000
Han and Chewie follow Finn. 	4030000
FITZGERALD Or he's run off and left us. 	4030000
MURPHY That weren't too smart. 	4030000
Looks over the controls. 	4030000
I just want to talk to you. 	4030000
It was... great. 	4030000
ABEL Good morning. 	4020000
DOCTOR Good morning. 	4020000
And you didn't try to tell anyone? 	4020000
He gets in without saying a word. 	4020000
The man looks up at the screen, then DROPS his cup of coffee. ,	4020000
That's where. 	4010000
Talk to me, man. ,	4010000
You no longer work for us. 	4010000
I know sometimes it -- CUSTOMER #1 Can I see the carton? 	4010000
Looks like Sam's not making it so...let's just call it. 	4010000
She finds his eyes. 	4010000
COOPER "Useless machines"? 18. 	4000000
MIA Why do you care so much about being liked -- ? 	4000000
WALTER I put up with your daughter. 	4000000
ROTH We should turn off the engines. 	3990000
Bernstein has come into the picture. 	3990000
When you are finished, come and talk to me. ,	3990000
DAVE So long as I'm here, Mark will continue to be paid. ,	3990000
Cooper turns and walks toward the bunker. 	3990000
Are you there? 	3990000
ABEL turns and sees what is happening. 	3990000
BERNSTEIN Isn't it wonderful? 	3980000
ABEL (CONT'D) Do you know how long it took me to pay you off? 	3970000
FINN Now you tell me? 	3970000
Who is that remarkably handsome and confident man? 	3970000
Sebastian keeps up with them, trying to let go of his presuppositions. ,	3970000
Working up her courage. 	3970000
Beyond the sparks, we see something else... ,	3970000
In silence. (CONTINUED) 10/29/14 / 33. 	3960000
He watches a CAR pull into the lot below. 	3960000
Cooper watches him finish in silence. 	3960000
They sit in silence for a while. 	3960000
Mark walks to his spot in front of the scrim. 	3960000
He stands and looks around. 	3960000
TROY What I wanted didn't matter then. 	3960000
Meet the warrior elite. 	3950000
JAKE Yeah, it's fantastic. ,	3950000
They meet. 	3950000
He tries again, choosing his words. ,	3940000
Reaches inside and pulls out the probe. 	3940000
LOUIS SERVIDIO then runs out of the car as the door opens. 	3940000
I couldn't help myself. 	3940000
It was no truer then than it is now. 	3930000
You hear me? 	3930000
The woman looks at it, stunned. ,	3920000
She seems to be on the phone, speaking into her car's system. ,	3920000
I'm letting life hit me `til it gets tired. 	3920000
Not sure where you are -- maybe Boston? 	3920000
TAYA I'm proud of you and I don't say it enough. 	3920000
They head off in opposite directions. 	3920000
We zero-in on a small fold on that black bag. 	3910000
He tries to stop it. 	3910000
They haven't developed tools, culture, language. ,	3900000
WALTER I'm trying! Ah, you know me. ,	3900000
Sam hangs up. 	3900000
How do you know you haven't done them before? 	3900000
His accent is strong yet you can understand every word. 	3900000
I'm letting life hit me `til it gets tired. 	3900000
Mind you, I guess you turned up eventually, didn't you? ,	3890000
CHRIS Nice to meet you, Taya. ,	3890000
But I don't want us hiding anything from them. 	3890000
ANGLE ON GLASS... ...eyes open... he can hear every word. 	3890000
I got my art back. (SOFT) My prayers have been answered. 	3880000
MARGARET I can't believe you lived in Paris. 	3880000
COOPER How could they all have landed in the same place? 	3880000
DANCER I'll be right back, honey. ,	3880000
LIONEL Pastrami sandwich on rye. 	3880000
FITZGERALD Just don't take a shot at me when I come back in. 	3880000
They turn to leave. 	3870000
DICK Walter... you never told me you had another daughter. 	3870000
GOAT Mustafa's not Iraqi. 	3870000
And then she sees him. 	3860000
Kane indicates he is to proceed. 	3860000
What the hell? 	3860000
LELAND You almost convince me. (rising) I'm just drunk enough to tell you the truth. 	3860000
Sitting down on the bed next to Bernstein, he starts to write. ,	3860000
The ladies grab the opening. 	3860000
Like us they were fixated on this place. 	3860000
ANDERSON `Less he could pull through. 	3850000
Mark walks toward him. 	3850000
Don't be sore. 	3850000
Silence as it hits her voicemail. 	3850000
She seems to be on the phone, speaking into her car's system. ,	3850000
Over the picture are crossed American flags. 	3850000
Revealing... underneath... the name "S. 	3840000
Unable to see two feet ahead. 	3840000
It's JULIAN. He is standing holding a gun. 	3840000
Behind him the combines continue to work, oblivious. ,	3840000
CARLO You're fat as a pig. 	3840000
MIKE (O.S.) Intimidating. 	3840000
Kurt rolls his eyes instinctively. 	3840000
And then she sees him. 	3830000
ABEL Let me see it. 	3830000
A sun-blasted sky. 	3830000
ABEL then does exactly that to them. 	3830000
ABEL Where are we exposed? 	3830000
ABEL gets up to go out. 	3830000
